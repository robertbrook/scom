	<br><blockquote><p>" and the court considers that, but for the power to make a community service order under subsection (1) above, it would have been appropriate to make a detention centre order in respect of the offender or to pass a youth custody sentence or a sentence of imprisonment on him ".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall also discuss amendment No. 52, in page 73, line 32, after " so ", insert " and
	<br><blockquote><p>(iii) but for the power to make a community service order under subsection (1) above, it would have made a detention centre order or a care order in respect of the offender or would have passed a youth custody sentence on him.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since the introduction of community service orders in six experimental areas in 1973, I think that they have proved to everybody concerned to have been a viable and constructive alternative to custody, and a sensible non-custodial penalty that has been available to the courts. However, although in passing the legislation, the Home Secretary and various Ministers gave a clear impression that they assumed that community service orders would be used as an alternative, where otherwise a custodial sentence would have been imposed, research carried out by the Home Office research unit suggests that perhaps only 40 or 50 per cent, of community service orders have been imposed where otherwise a custodial sentence would have been the case. The figures demonstrate this fairly convincingly. In the last decade, there has been an increase in community service orders imposed on those in the 17 to 20-year-old age group. At the same time, there has been a reduction in the number of probation orders passed on that age group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 82 stipulates that a community service order may only be imposed if otherwise the court would have imposed a custodial sentence. As I said earlier, this was indeed the notion that was in the Home Secretary's mind in instituting the Criminal Justice Bill in 1971, which had within it the provision to make community service orders. I understand that the courts like to feel free to make their own decisions as to the appropriate penalty in a specific case with a particular offender. As we have heard reiterated several times in these debates, we must give as much discretion, flexibility and freedom of manoeuvre to the courts as possible; but at the
	<span class='label label-info column'>484</span>
same time it is both fair and reasonable to suggest that this measure, which was conceived as an alternative to custody, is currently being misused, as evidence from both the probation service and the British Association of Social Workers demonstrates, and that therefore every effort should be made to bring it back to what it was originally conceived to be. That is, an alternative which will be imposed when otherwise the court would impose a custodial sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One could argue, at one level, that if unlimited resources were available, there would not necessarily be a great deal to complain about in community services orders being given to offenders who would not attract a custodial sentence. I do not necessarily accept that argument, because that then tends to lower the esteem of the community service order in the eyes of the courts and those outside. It brings it down the tariff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the fear of the probation service and the social workers, in relation to the extension of community service orders to 16-year-olds. However, it is not the case that with unlimited resources we could use community service orders for those who did not attract a custodial sentence. We know that the probation service in many areas is having to tell the court that it cannot supervise any further community service orders because of lack of resources in those areas. That in itself is regrettable. Perhaps the Minister will indicate to the Committee today what action is taken to ensure that in such areas there is no inhibition on the freedom of discretion of the courts to pass community service orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that there are limited resources, it seems sensible to ensure that those resources are concentrated where they are most needed—and where they are most needed is in offering an alternative to custody and therefore ensuring that community service orders are applied so far as is possible only to those offenders who would otherwise have been sent to prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a point made by the British Association of Social Workers in its comments made available to every Member of the Committee. Equally important, it points to the different interpretation that courts place on community service orders. In some areas they see them as an alternative to custody, whereas in others they see them as another noncustodial alternative. The association points out that the different interpretations reflect badly on sentencing practice and can lead to injustices, and adds:
	<br><blockquote><p>" We are aware of one area where every effort is made by courts and the probation service to use the sentence as an alternative to custody and 120 hours of community service is regarded as an acceptable alternative to a ' short custodial sentence '."</p></blockquote>
We take this to mean three months imprisonment. It continues—
	<br><blockquote><p>" However, in another part of the country there are suggestions that people have been sentenced to 240 hours who would otherwise have been fined."</p></blockquote>
We all know that is the case. That is the price we have to pay for giving the courts the discretion
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0406">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>485</span>
that Conservative Members seem to think is so wonderful and sensible. Giving them that kind of discretion leads, as BASW has pointed out, to injustices and anomalies where in one area a community service order is only given if otherwise a sentence of imprisonment would have been imposed yet in another area it would be used as an alternative for other non-custodial alternatives. It is unfair and unreasonable and it goes against the whole principle and intentions behind the introduction of community service orders which was to try to divert people from penal establishments and instead make them provide a constructive contribution to the community by being made to work in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also support amendment No. 52 tabled by my hon. Friends on the Opposition Front Bench which makes a similar stipulation to my amendment No. 82 in relation to 16-year-olds. As I have already indicated, like NAPO and BASW, I support an extension of community service orders to 16-year-olds that is provided for in the Bill and that was a recommendation of the all-party Penal Affairs Report "Young Offenders—A Strategy for the Future ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware of the fears of the probation service, or at least some members of the probation service— not all and certainly not the chief conference of probation officers. I am aware, too, of the fears expressed by BASW. It is slightly unfortunate that both those organisations, which are constantly quite rightly clambering for a more humane and senstive penal policy and always suggesting a greater use of non-custodial measures should, every time that one is proposed—whether it be, as in this case, a community service order extending to 16-year-olds or in the case of automatic release on parole—suddenly throw up a whole series of objections from their particular vantage point, their vested interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unfortunate and regrettable that those two organisations should always seek on these occasions to take a narrow perspective of what is regarded by everyone else to be a radical and sensible proposal aimed at reducing either the prison population or the number of people incarcerated in institutions. It is suddenly not so attractive if it happens to affect their particular vested interests. I do not accept the arguments advanced by the probation service that the extension of community service orders to 16-year-olds will bring it down the tariff and, therefore, to some extent undermine the viability and credibility of the community service orders and make them less attractive to the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remedy is in the hands of the probation service and individual probation officers. They, as I have indicated before, are responsible for making the recommendation to the courts, and the courts are required to take their recommendation into account when considering whether or not to impose a CSO.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the amendments would obviate those fears. If amendment No. 52 were accepted, so that a community service order could only be imposed on a 16-year-old as a direct alternative to a custodial sentence, it would clearly overcome all the fears that
	<span class='label label-info column'>486</span>
have been expressed by both BASW and certain probation officers, stop the community service order slipping down the tariff, prevent the undermining of its credibility and validity in the eyes of the court and make a sensible contribution to penal policy. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will look favourably on both the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Shirley Summerskill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) has really moved amendment No. 52 in his speech. I would just like to say, however, that I agree with what he said. The strength of these amendments, and No. 52 in particular, is that they encourage courts to use the community service order as an alternative to a custodial sentence which the Opposition want to further. They say to the court that it should only use a community service order as a positive alternative order. It will concentrate the mind of the court on imposing this instead of sending somebody into custody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the reservations voiced by the probation officers and social workers, the case they make to which I am most sympathetic concerns manpower and finance. Although we may agree about the principle of extending community service orders, I understand that they are concerned that they have the people to supervise those who are given a community service order and have the finances to carry them out. These are important points which they continually draw to our attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said in the last debate, the Bill is vague. We were told by the Minister that there will be 150 more probation officers. I do not know whether he has any information about social workers or about the finances or man and woman power there. It seems to me relevant that the Committee should consider how these service orders will actually be implemented unless the people such as probation officers and social workers have the financial and manpower backing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to both the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Lady for the way in which they have outlined these amendments. Perhaps the most convenient thing to do is to take them in turn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of amendment No. 82 would be to prevent a court from making a community service order on an offender of any age unless,
	<br><blockquote><p>" but for the power to make a community service order … it would have been appropriate to make a detention centre order … or to pass a youth custody sentence or a sentence of imprisonment … ".</p></blockquote>
As the current law and the Bill stand, courts may only make orders on offenders who have committed imprisonable offences, but there is no requirement that an order should only be made if, but for the power to make an order, a custodial sentence would have been considered appropriate. The intention of the amendment is to prevent courts from using community service to displace noncustodial disposals. It is unclear what the practical effect of the amendment would be, since it would be difficult to dispute a court's claim that it would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0407">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>487</span>
have considered a custodial penalty appropriate in the absence of a power to make a community service order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the hon. Lady's amendment would be to prevent a court from making a community service order on a 16-year-old offender unless, but for the power to make the order, it would have made a detention centre or care order or passed a youth custody sentence. As the Bill stands, courts will only be able to make orders on 16-year-olds who have committed imprisonable offences, but there is no requirement that an order should be made if the offender would otherwise have received a custodial sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of the amendment is to prevent courts from using the newly-available powers to make community service orders on 16-year-olds in circumstances in which they would currently discharge or fine the offender, or make a supervision or attendance centre order. The practical effect of the amendment is unclear, as it would never be possible to show conclusively that a court had reached the requirement that it introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what the hon. Gentleman said at the outset—that the success of the community service order has proved most encouraging. I also agree that it has as its primary and general purpose the provision of an alternative to custodial sentences, and that it is important that it should not, as it were, slip down the tariff. But I part company with what was implicit in his speech—that there are no circumstances in which it is proper for a community service order to be made as an alternative to another non-custodial sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have fairly indicated the intention of the hon. Gentleman's proposal. We have some sympathy with its objective, but there are difficulties in legislating in this way. The CSO was introduced in the 1972 Act to provide the courts with an alternative to a short custodial sentence. Since then, the scheme has grown rapidly. National coverage was achieved early in 1979. In 1980, more than 22,000 offenders were given orders—a figure which represents 4 per cent, of all those sentenced for indictable offences. These offenders all committed imprisonable offences, and it is believed that many of them would otherwise have gone into custody. We therefore have the community service order to thank for the fact that a considerable number of offenders have not received custodial sentences but have instead remained in the community and made constructive and practical reparation for their offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Speaking from memory, I think that in the last full year there was an increase of 40 per cent, in the number that the courts made. That indicates the confidence of the courts in the way in which the community service orders are working. I pay tribute to the part played in that by the probation service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That community service has achieved these results owes a great deal to the efforts of successive Governments to encourage the courts to regard it as an alternative to custody. Most hon. Members will be
	<span class='label label-info column'>488</span>
aware of the booklet, " The Sentence of the Court" and the fact that it was produced by the Home Office and is widely consulted by sentencers. The section on community service orders says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The community service order was introduced with the primary purpose of providing a constructive alternative for those offenders who would otherwise have received a short custodial sentence … It was the emphasis both on the Advisory Council on the Penal System in its report on Non-Custodial and Semi-Custodial Penalties … in proposing the introduction of community service, and of Parliament in giving effect to the recommendations of the Council, that community service should be seen as a penal sanction that made serious demands on the offender and could thus be regarded as a viable alternative to a custodial sentence."</p></blockquote>
Like our predecessors, we have taken every opportunity to stress the possibility of using CSOs as an alternative to custody, but to go further and to impose a statutory requirement that courts should not use CSOs other than as an alternative to cutsody would, I think, be to overstep the mark that is desirable. We are faced by the issue which has already arisen several times in the Committee— the hon. Gentleman has referred to it—of the extent to which we should confer or restrict a discretion exercisable by the courts. This is always a matter for careful judgment, but I believe that the amendment, quite apart from its uncertain practical effects, would err on the side of undue restriction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also ought to consider the effect that the amendment would have on offenders who, having breached the requirements of a CSO, are dealt with afresh for their original offence. Of course, it is to be hoped that as many orders as possible will be successfully completed, but we must accept that there will always be some failures, and at present these offenders do not always automatically receive custodial sentences when they are brought back to court. But if the amendment were passed, the courts might feel obliged to pass a custodial sentence whatever the special or extenuating circumstances, and I think that is a consequence that all members of the Committee would regret.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not to say that there must be any slackening of what is said—the warning that is given to an offender, when sentenced to community service, that if he breaches it he will be dealt with for the original offence, which is, of course, an imprisonable offence. However, there should not be thought to be an automatic requirement that custody shall be the result in those circumstances. The same argument might also be applied to a subsequent offence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is precisely one of the problems, the present disparity in sentencing practices in relation to community service orders. The courts have an impossible task when an offender is brought back before them for sentencing after failing to co-operate with a community service order. They must ascertain what was in the mind of the original court that imposed the community service order, given that in some cases they would have committed him to custody had the community service order not been available, whereas in other cases the evidence is clear that the community service order has been imposed as an alternative to a fine. That makes the task of the courts very much more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0408">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>489</span>
Their task would be much easier if it was clear that the community service order in all cases was used to divert the individual offenders from custody.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point that the hon. Gentleman makes, and I do not dispute for a moment that it would make the task of the court easier because it would remove a discretion. But it does not follow that it would make the ultimate decision of the court more just in each case. The sentencing court in these circumstances will have the same reports before it as were before the court in the original instance, and one has here to rely upon the courts to do justice in the light of all the circumstances as seems more expedient and right to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that community service is sometimes used to displace other non-custodial disposals, particularly the fine. Although it may be argued that this is not the primary purpose— and it is not the primary purpose of the CSO—we should think very carefully about the implications before denying the courts this option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Orders are, no doubt, sometimes made on unemployed offenders because the court judges that to be unable to pay a fine may well lead them ultimately to imprisonment in default. There are circumstances in which it is proper for a court which would have imposed a fine as a first choice to impose a CSO as preferable to custody. Orders are, no doubt, sometimes made in those circumstances
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if the courts were barred from making orders in these circumstances, a proportion of these offenders would almost certainly end up in custody through inability to pay a fine—perhaps it would be more accurate to say a failure to pay a fine. So, paradoxically, an amendment intended to increase the effectiveness of CSOs as an alternative to custody might result in more offenders finding their way into prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we ought to leave well alone because in attempting to improve things we could make them worse. The probation service is preparing social inquiry reports and the courts, when passing sentence, have regard to them and they now have a long experience of the types of offender suited to this disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked what we are doing about areas where CSOs are now in difficulty because of lack of resources. Additional provision of 3 per cent, real growth is being made for the probation service in 1982-83, equivalent to the addition of 150 probation officers. It is for local probation committees to allocate resources in accordance with demands made on the service. The probation inspectorate is well aware of these problems and it has been able to offer advice to chief probation officers on the deployment of their resources in order to meet the increasing demand for CSOs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked what we were doing about social workers, but I must tell her that community service is always administered by the probation services. I believe that it is right to allow the CSOs to develop as they are doing at the moment without changing their statutory authority. I very much hope
	<span class='label label-info column'>490</span>
that in these circumstances it may be possible for the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment. If not, I am afraid I shall have to advise the Committee that these two amendments should not be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In introducing the Criminal Justice Act in Parliament on 22 November 1971, the then Home Secretary said:
	<br><blockquote><p>" I was attracted from the start to the idea that people who have committed minor offences would be better occupied doing a service to their fellow citizens than sitting alongside others in a crowded gaol."</p></blockquote>
There is a clear implication there that community service—doing a service to one's fellow citizens—is an alternative to a custodial sentence. He said further on his speech:
	<br><blockquote><p>" This will, of course, have to be a voluntary choice of the individual concerned for a number of reasons; after all, if it is not done voluntarily the work will not be good. The alternative will be to go to gaol".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 22 November 1971; Vol. 826, col. 972.]</p></blockquote>
I know that there was some doubt about what the Committee meant and about what the motivation was in suggesting community service orders, but I think it is stated fairly clearly there that the community service order was intended as another alternative to custody primarily, though not exclusively, for those who would otherwise have been given a prison sentence. If it is not so used, it leads to the anomalies and injustices to which I have referred, which have been brought to our attention by BASW. It also means that the credibility of the community service order will be insidiously and consistently eroded, as courts find that it is not as tough, as serious or as reliable an option as it formerly was, and as it is supposed to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has spoken about a 3 per cent, growth in the real budget of resources available to the probation service and has said that a further 150 probation officers will be recruited this year, he knows that 200 probation trainees were unemployed anyway, so he will not even be taking up the full quota of those who have actually been trained for the probation service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that resources are limited, it seems sensible and desirable that those resources should be concentrated en the most important and most sensitive area in the penal system—on those who would go to prison but who do not necessarily need to be incarcerated. They can be cared for and dealt with just as effectively—perhaps even more so—in the community than behind bars. This is particularly true at a time when all the evidence suggests that we ought to be diverting offenders away from custodial institutions. Indeed, it is the policy of the Government to try to encourage and cajole the courts and sentencing authorities into insisting that a larger proportion of offenders spend their sentences in the community rather than in penal establishments. It is particularly relevant at present, in view of the overcrowded conditions in many of our prisons, particularly in the local prisons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all those reasons, and others, it seems sensible and desirable that the community service order,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0409">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>491</span>
successful as it has been, appreciated as it is, should be used as a direct alternative to custody. That is clearly not the case at the moment, for at least 50 per cent, of those who are given community service orders, but it would be the consequence of the amendments tabled by myself and my hon. Friend. Given the inadequacy of the Minister's reply, I suggest to my hon. Friends that we put this to a vote and I ask them to join me in voting for amendment No. 82.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments concern the arrangements for the amendment of community service orders when offenders move from one petty sessions area to another. Section 17(5) of the 1973 Act, as amended by the Bill, provides that before amending an order in these circumstances it must appear to the courts that provisions can be made for the offender to perform work under the community service arrangements in the area in which he will be residing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These amendments will add the stipulation that in the case of 16-year-olds the court should have been notified that community service arrangements for offenders of this age exist in the petty sessions area concerned. The notification condition follows a similar requirement to which the courts will be subject when making orders on 16-year-olds. The point of the requirement is to allow an orderly introduction of community service for 16-year-olds. We expect that the probation service will have to make special arrangements for this age group, and the requirement for notification by the Secretary of State will ensure that orders are not made until appropriate arrangements have been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>495</span>
the purpose of the clauses and amendments. Essentially, they achieve for Scotland what clauses 27 to 34 achieve for England and Wales—the abolition of enhanced penalties for summary offences in primary legislation, a general uprating of maximum summary fines into the five-point scale of fines introduced by the Criminal Law Act 1977 and the consolidation of that five-point scale into a standard scale of fines for summary offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the proposals may appear elaborate, they insert into the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975 four new sections. Amendments Nos.103, 105 and 107 are essentially drafting amend ments which bring the wording of certain provisions in the new sections to be inserted into the Criminal Procedure Act 1979, into line with the wording of existing sections of the 1975 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment makes it clear that the provisions dealing with the abolition of enhanced penalties do not apply to section 290 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975. That section provides that where a person is convicted by the sheriff of a second or subsequent offence inferring dishonest appropriation of property, or attempt thereat, or a second or subsequent offence inferring personal violence, he may be sentenced to imprisonment for any period not exceeding six months. Section 290 does not provide an enhanced penalty as such—rather, it confers upon the sheriff a general competence to impose a sentence of up to six months' imprisonment in certain cases. We believe that it would be wrong to extend that competence to cases where the offence was a first offence. The amendment therefore removes any possibility of such extension by specifically excluding section 290 from the scope of the provisions dealing with the abolition of enhanced penalties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The reason for that exemption is that the enactments mentioned in the schedule were amended shortly before the Criminal Law Act 1977 was passed and the amendments that were made anticipated the scale of fines introduced by the 1977 Act. It would not, therefore, be appropriate for section 289F further to increase the penalties in the enactments.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Section 394 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975, which confers on Scottish courts the power to mitigate penalties, provides that where the summary penalty for contravention of any statute order involves imprisonment the court shall have power to: —
	<br><blockquote><p>" substitute for imprisonment a fine which is the case of any offence triable either summarily or an indictment shall not exceed the prescribed sum and in the case of an offence triable only summarily shall not exceed £200…"</p></blockquote>
Unlike most other sums in the 1975 Act, the " £200 " mentioned in section 394 is not inflation-proofed, so that as other fines etc. are increased to take account of inflation this fine will remain at its current level. Thus, as this tine reduces in real terms, the courts may impose imprisonment when a more adequate fine would be more appropriate. The amendment is therefore designed to increase the fine not exceeding £200 to one not exceeding £500 in line with the increase in several other sums in the 1975 Act, and also to inflation-proof it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With New Clause 1 it is convenient to take new clause 2—	<i>Attachment of earnings orders.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New clause 1 provides for offenders to be provided with a form requesting details of their income and financial commitments which the court would then be required to take into account when determining the amount of any fine to be imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 2 enables the court to impose an attachment of earnings order at the time that a fine is imposed with the consent of the offender. Both new clauses embody recommendations of the parliamentary all-party Penal Affairs Group's report " Too Many Prisoners", and both emanate from the concern of members of that Committee, and indeed many others, about the increasing number of fine dafaulters received into prison department establishments. For example, it is interesting to note that the percentage of those fined in court who ended up in prison increased from seven per 1,000 in 1973 to 11 per 1,000 in 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In absolute terms the number of fine defaulters in prison has increased from 10,426 in 1973 to 15,940 in 1980. Fine defaulters now represent one-quarter of all receptions of sentenced prisoners, which is a fairly important element of the prison population particularly in the context of overcrowded prisons and overcrowded local prisons where most fine defaulters are held. Fine defaulters tend, by their very nature, to be concentrated in urban areas where they impose great burdens on the courts and, as I have said, on the local overcrowded prisons. For that reason the May Committee inquiry on the prison service recommended that prisons should be avoided whenever possible for maintenance defaulters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Home Office Research Unit Study No. 45 " Fines in Magistrates' Courts " published in 1978 found that offenders who had been fined and had defaulted on their fines actually spent a great deal less of their income on essential items like food, clothing, rent, rates and so on. It was indeed their straitened, difficult financial circumstances that had led them to default in the first place, rather than any wilful refusal to pay the fines. That research study found that 78 per cent, of defaulters said that they needed the money that was required to pay the fine for items such as shoes, clothing, food, rent, rates and so on. It was on those more important items, particularly in the context of the fine defaulter's having a family and young children, that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0414">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>501</span>
limited financial resources available to the families had been expended, rather than upon the payment of the fine—not a decision which, in those circumstances, I regard as unreasonable—nor, I suggest, would any other member of the Committeee. It is difficult for a father or moth to decide whether to buy the extra item of clothing for their children to go to school and the extra essential item of food, or whether to pay the fine and therefore prevent defaulting and imprisonment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extremely important that the courts should be flexible and sensitive in the imposing of fines, and try to ensure that that kind of decision is not imposed upon offenders. It is important that courts impose fines with great care and that the fine is not unfair or unreasonable. They presumably want to avoid the imprisonment of fine defaulters, and it is therefore important to ensure that the fine is within the means of pay of the offender on whom it is imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other countries go to considerable lengths to try to ensure that the fine is within the means of the offender, that he will have the ability to pay and that it imposes as much impact upon one offender with limited resources as upon another with much larger resources. They go to those lengths not only in the interests of justice, but to ensure that the fine is actually paid and that the offender does not go to prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sweden, for instance, has a day-fine system, where fines are imposed for similar offences, but at different levels upon different offenders, to ensure that the same impact is made upon offenders in different financial circumstances. West Germany has a very similar system. Indeed, the advisory council on the penal system in 1970 said that the Swedish system was attractive, and suggested that consideration be given to introducing it in the United Kingdom. The Expenditure Committee report on the reducing of pressure on the prison system, published in 1978, under the chairmanship of the hon. Member for Plymouth, Drake (Miss Fookes), and the parliamentary all-party Penal Affairs Group's report "Too Many Prisoners", published in 1980, both recommended that the Government should review the system of fines and entertain the possibility of introducing a day-fine system. In response to those recommendations and pressures, the Government's White Paper of 1980 said that they would fully explore the proposals put forward and the concept of introducing a day-fine system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some courts already determine the number of weeks income to be deducted when imposing a fine. They establish the weekly pay of the offender, estimate the number of weeks that he should be made to lose income, according to the gravity of the fine, and tailor the fine precisely to his circumstances and to the effect they want to have upon him. That sensitivity of the court was drawn to the attention of the NACRO working party on fine default, chaired by Lady Howe, which recommended the extension of that principle to other courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no reason why we should not go so far today, given the sympathetic noises that the Minister has
	<span class='label label-info column'>502</span>
made in the House on previous occasions on precisely the same subject. In a sense, his credibility is slightly at stake today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he cannot go as far as totally accepting the amendment, there seems to be no reason at all why he should not ensure that a practice direction is given to the courts to ensure that at least they take into account the recommendation that was made in the NACRO working party report. It is already done by some courts which take into consideration the factors I have been describing. The evidence produced to the NACRO working party was that it worked there very successfully and effectively. Therefore, there seems to be no reason why it could not voluntarily be extended throughout the country. I hope that at least the Minister would be able to say that a practice direction to the courts will be issued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know, of course, that section 31 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1952 enjoins courts to take into consideration the means of the defendant when considering the imposition of a fine, and I know that the courts take those factors into account, but only in so far as they are made known. We know from evidence that has been produced to our own working party and to the all-party Penal Affairs Group when we were drafting and considering the report " Too Many Prisoners", and we also know from the evidence produced by the hon. Member for Paddington (Mr. Wheeler) in his pamphlet, " Who Prevents Crime" published in 1980 by the Conservative political centre, that, in fact, the courts do not often have available to them a full and accurate picture of the defendant's means when they are imposing a fine. Indeed, as the hon. Member for Paddington said, the process is very much a mixture of " bluff and chance ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, because of the inadequacies of the actual information available to the courts, and to magistrates in particular, he, as a magistrate, proposed the introduction of a form similar to that provided in the green form legal aid scheme. That what is entailed in new clause 1. It is already used in Scotland to great effect, where it is available to any defendant with his consent to fill in the full details of his means, financial circumstances and capital. It has been shown conclusively from experience of the working of the form in Scotland that it is very effective in ensuring that fines are related in a sensitive manner to the means of an offender. Therefore, hopefully, it will prevent defaulting and imprisonment for defaulting, which we all want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, it is administratively fairly straightforward to introduce if we accept the suggestion of the Advisory Council on the Penal System in 1970 that the form be sent out with the summons. Administratively, we are not imposing any substantial extra burden on the courts. Also, of course, 	<div class='sup'>;</div> <!-- sup -->' is very cost effective and productive. For a miniscule outlay and a very small extra effort on paperwork, we can achieve great results in terms of preventing defaulting, ensuring that fines are paid and ensuring that people are not imprisoned at the taxpayers' expense—something like £170 per week
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0415">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>503</span>
—in the local, overcrowded prison. I am sure we would all want to see those objectives realised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The form that is envisaged by new clause 1 should enable a simple, straightforward calculation to be made of the offender's income and capital. He should be able to produce evidence in support of it in terms of pay slips, hire purchase agreements and so on, and it should ensure that the courts would be able properly and fully to take into account the precise circumstances when imposing a fine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When this was last debated on 14th May 1981, the Minister said that he had a genuine interest in and a sympathy for the proposal that is now contained in new clause 1. On that occasion he gave me an assurance that he would undertake to consult the Magistrates' Association, the Justices Clerks, Society and other appropriate bodies to see whether it would be practicable and desirable to employ the kind of form for the purpose suggested. He also on that occasion—it is clearly on the record—agreed to consult to see whether, in the first instance, the Government could usefully promote a pilot scheme, or more than one pilot scheme, on a limited scale to see whether there was any value in the use of such a form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was on that basis, on the clear—I have no reason to believe that it was insincere—statement of the Minister that he had sympathy for, supported and after consultation would possibly introduce a pilot scheme, that I withdrew my amendment to the Social Security Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some time has elapsed since 14 May 1981. I have not forgotten what the Minister said then, but I have not been harrying him because I had no doubt that he would not renege on his promises. I know that he means what he says and would no doubt have carried out his promise. But it is not unreasonable now, 10 months later, to ask the Minister to tell us the results of the promised consultations, and whether he is now persuaded that he can accept the principles of new clause 1, with which he said that he had genuine sympathy? We should like the Minister to show that when he makes promises he can actually fulfil them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn briefly to new clause 2, which enables the court to impose an attachment of earnings order at the time at which a fine is imposed, rather than when it is defaulted, with the consent of the defendant. Home Office Research Study No. 46, on fines in magistrates' courts, to which I have already referred, found that action to enforce payment had been taken against 48 per cent, of a sample of 3,240 offenders who had been fined and, as a rule, action was not taken until the offender had defaulted in payment. In only 5 per cent, of cases was action taken when the fines were first imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While that study's conclusion was that there was some scope for a wider use of attachment of earnings orders, these were made in only 25 cases and in 92 per cent, of those cases the order resulted in some payment—a much higher success rate than in any other known method of enforcing the payment of fines. In its policy statement, " Sentencing in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>504</span>
1980s ", the Justices Clerks' Society said that it was convinced that the attachment of earnings order could be a valuable means of enforcing both maintenance orders and sums payable on conviction. It went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>" We would recommend that the current restrictions upon attachment of earnings orders be removed, and that they should be able to be made at the time the fine or other sum is ordered without default."</p></blockquote>
The all-party Penal Affairs Group endorsed that proposal in its report, " Too Many Prisoners ", and it is therefore contained in new clause 2. Since we published our report, the Magistrates' Association and the NACRO working party under Lady Howe have both proposed that it should be possible to make attachment of earnings orders at the time a fine is imposed but with the offender's consent. I should understand if the Minister today wished to make the same qualification and I should be prepared to accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I hope that he will now feel able to make a positive response to the spirit of the proposal in new clause 2, which would be a small but useful improvement in the effectiveness of the enforcement process. But, far more important, one wants him to make a more than positive response to the principles and, indeed, the practice laid down in new clause 1, which, as I have indicated, he has shown himself on a previous occasion to support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support both new clause 1 and new clause 2. The importance of new clause 1, and the whole question of fines is that the majority of all offenders found guilty by courts are fined. So fining is the commonest form of punishment used by courts today, and therefore it is something that we should take very seriously in the Bill, to ensure that that form of punishment is effective and properly implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Home Office study relating to magistrates' courts showed that offenders fined are less likely to be reconvicted within two years of their sentence than offenders with similar characteristics who are dealt with in another way, so there is evidence that fining is an effective form of sentences in that the recidivism rate is low and is very good. For many reasons therefore—because of the convenience of fining and the fact that it appears to be effective— we should take this very seriously as a form of punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in 1979 fine defaulters numbered more than 17,000 in our prisons. This meant that a large number of people were there not because they had been sent to prison as a punishment, but because they could not pay—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that in a moment. They were sent to prison because they did not pay their fines. There were 17,000 people there whom the courts did not intentionally send to prison. The courts had sentenced them to a fine, not to prison. If we could do something about those 17,000 people it would greatly relieve the prison population.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0416">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>505</span>
Earlier in our discussion, I pointed out that the fastest growing section of the prison population was fine defaulters. The Minister expressed surprise by saying " Is it? " or " I didn't know that", or words to that effect. I know he is not in charge of prisons within the Home Office and so he cannot know everything about them, but I hope he has now grasped that fact—that fine defaulters is the fastest growing section of the prison population, and that this ought to receive serious consideraticn from all who want to reduce the prison population.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Is the ratio similar to the increase in the total numbers going to prison, or what is the differential?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: am sure that the Minister will be able to give a perfect answer to that when he replies. I hope that the Minister will be able to give the Committee facts such as that. The fine is failing in its objective if the result is that the person fined is eventually put into custody. That is a sign of the failure of the sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give the Minister time to find out the answer to his hon. Friend's question. I am sure it can be written down while I am talking. There is no point in having a fine if so often it fails actually to be enforced, as witness the 17,000 in prison in 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of those 17,000 fine defaulters in prison—I am taking the 1979 figure, but no doubt he has the current one—how many are there because they could not pay the fine for financial reasons, and how many are there because they would not pay the fine, simply because they decided that they did not wish to pay the fine for various reasons of their own? We must know the categories—those who " could not pay " or " would not pay " of those who are now in prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 1 deals with the first category—those who could not pay. Surely it is most important that, when a court imposes a fine, it should be a reasonable one which can be paid. Otherwise it takes away its whole purpose. New clause 1 helps to ensure that no fine is imposed that a person is literally incapable of paying for financial reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 2 deals with the second category of fine defaulters—those who do not wish to pay and are deliberately saying for reasons best known to themselves, " I am not going to pay this fine, and would even be prepared to go to prison as a result." The attachment of earnings order seems to be res-
	<span class='label label-info column'>506</span>
tricted, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk said in his speech. I want the Minister to justify the present restrictions. The new clause would make attachment of earnings an effective way of raising the fine from people who are deliberately not wanting to pay, and it would also extend their operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Justices' Clerks' Society is strongly in support of using attachment of earnings as one way of ensuring that there are not so many fine defaulters. Unless the Minister can produce some cogent arguments for opposing the new clauses, they seem to deal very effectively with the growing problem of fine defaulters—the fastest-growing section of the prison population—and will deal with both categories, those who cannot pay and those who will not pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with great interest to the two speeches that we have heard on the two clauses. There is a great deal of common ground in the Committee on the topic with which they deal. Nobody wishes to see anybody taking up prison accommodation; and nobody wishes to see anybody sent to prison, save where it is essential either for the protection of the public or as an ultimate sanction to enforce the order of the court. We are talking here about the second category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have in the past expressed my own strong opinion, and the Government's opinion, that it is necessary to retain the sanction of imprisonment as a last resort where somebody will not pay a fine that has been imposed upon him. There would be many more fines unpaid if that sanction were not available to the courts today. We should not underestimate the injustice that would result if the law-abiding struggle to pay fines, with a great deal of necessary sacrifice—that is part of what is intended by the court that imposes them—in circumstances in which others, similarly fined, decide not to pay and get away with it without losing their liberty. That would be very unjust, and would be seen to be unjust. There is no doubt in the mind of the Government that the ultimate sanction of imprisonment is an effective one which should remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, however, important to bear in mind the circumstances in which it can be exercised. The court has to be satisfied that the default is due to the offender's wilful refusal or culpable neglect. When the hon. Lady asked me what proportion of the people in prison for fine default were there because they could not pay, she was not really addressing herself to the proper question. The law does not permit a court to send somebody to prison for defaulting on a fine unless it has asked itself whether the neglect to pay has been culpable—in other words that he has had the ability to pay and has chosen not to do so. That is a very important distinction which must be maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 35 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>" In fixing the amount of a fine, a magistrates' court shall take into consideration among other things the means
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0417">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>507</span>
of the person on whom the fine is imposed so far as they appear or are known to the court:"</p></blockquote>
Exactly how a court should obtain information as to the defendant's means is not prescribed in the statute. Where a plea of guilty by post is offered the accused is normally offered the opportunity of providing the court with information about his financial circumstances prior to the hearing. Where the defendant is present, such information can be obtained by questioning him in court. We are aware, however, that some courts already invite a defendant to complete a questionnaire about his means before his case comes to court. New clause 1 has that effect. It would require the Secretary of State to make regulations requiring any person charged with an offence to be furnished with a form seeking details of his income and financial commitments. There would be no compulsion upon the defendant to complete the form, but if he did so the court concerned would have to have regard to its contents when fixing the amount of any fine which it imposed on him for the offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are sympathetic to the principle of new clause 1 because it is important that when a court fixes a fine it should have regard to means. That is in the statute already. Therefore, anything that helps in a reasonable way to enable the court to find out what the true means and financial position cf the defendant is is to be welcomed. The hon. Gentleman is perfectly correct. I expressed the same sentiments when we debated the Social Security Bill on 1 May last year. I am glad to tell him that he will not be disappointed and that we have followed up the lines of inquiry which I referred to then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are not at all certain that provision along the lines set out in new clause 1 is necessary to achieve its object. All that it will achieve is that, subject to the Secretary of State making the necessary regulations, a court would send a form to a defendant and in the event of his conviction would have regard to its contents if he completed it and made it available to the court. However, neither the new clause nor the regulations made under it would require the defendant actually to fill the form in. He would remain entirely free to ignore it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not at all persuaded that the statute book should be used in that way. I think that we want to explore further, and I am coming to the investigations that we have made, how the voluntary schemes that certain courts are operating at the moment might be developed and why we wish to consider a pilot scheme with the Magistrates' Association. The Magistrates' Association, after long examination of the matter, is ready to support a pilot scheme. We have consulted it. The Justices' Clerks' Society, to whom I also referred, have not expressed a view antagonistic to such a study but it urged that the form was not necessary in all cases. It suggests, for example, that it need not be used in minor road traffic cases where only a small fine would be imposed. That is an important consideration because we do not want to overburden the courts with administrative tasks unless a useful purpose was served. And so we are now approaching
	<span class='label label-info column'>508</span>
both the Magistrates' Association and the society with a view to establishing a pilot project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge that that is exactly in line with what I promised when we talked about these matters in May.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman. Is the Minister saying that he will now consult the Magistrates' Association and the justices' clerks and that he has let the past 10 months go by without doing so? He gave that impression.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the hon. Gentleman has to consult with his friends and so forth, but if he had been paying attention he would have heard that we have already consulted both the Magistrates' Association and the Association of Justices' Clerks about the possibility of establishing a pilot project in a few courts to test the use that might be made of a form to show a defendant's means and assist the courts in setting the level of a fine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The association has indicated that it would support such a pilot project and the society are not opposed to the idea—I say it again for the benefit of the hon. Gentleman—but they take the view that it is not necessary in all cases. We are exploring the possibility further and if, at the end of the day, it proves to have been a useful initiative we shall commend the use of such a form to all magistrates' courts. In the meantime, it is right to proceed with the pilot study. I am very happy to go ahead with that and if, as I say, it proves to be encouraging we should certainly wish to commend the use of such a form to all magistrates' courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to raise another point on new clause 1. As there are more than 17,000 people in prison who have wilfully decided not to pay their fines, has the Home Office research unit done any work into the motives behind those people deciding that they would rather lose their liberty than pay the fine? There is a section of the prison population who were not sentenced to prison but are now filling up the prisons by deciding to default</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of any detailed analysis of the breakdown of the motives of individual offenders who have been fined and either wilfully refused or culpably neglected to pay their fine. I do not think that such a survey could conceivably be undertaken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been such research, which I mentioned in my speech when moving the amendment. The Home Office research unit study 45 " Fines in Magistrates' Courts" published in 1978 analysed the questionnaires completed by 368 offenders fined for various offences. It found that they had defaulted because they chose to spend their money on more essential and priority expenditure, such as clothing, food, rent and rates. That clearly gives the impression that those people who default
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0418">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>509</span>
are not necessarily deliberately and wilfully flouting the wishes of the courts or refusing to pay their fines, but are actually caught in a terrible vice-either paying a fine and going without food and clothing or providing the food and clothing and going to prison in default. Have I spoken for long enough for the Minister to obtain advice? The evidence is overwhelming. The whole intention of the form and the pilot scheme in magistrates' courts' areas that I suggested is designed to stop defendants being placed in an unenviable position and to stop courts having to imprison offenders in default.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) asked if there had been research into the reasons why 17,000 people in prison—a figure which I wish to correct—had failed to pay their fines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is quite impossible for courts to know in precise detail on what the defaulters have preferred to spend their money. They must find that a defaulter has either wilfully refused or culpably neglected to pay his fine, which means that he has taken the decision not to pay the fine when it would have been reasonable, having regard to his other essential obligations, to have paid it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady said that 17,000 people are in prison for fine default. That is not correct. It is an important mistake. There are about 17,000 receptions for fine default every year, but the number in prison is less than 1,000. It is important that it should not gain currency in the country that 17,000 people are in prison at any one time because they have not paid their fines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vivian Bendali 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ilford, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) said, has the Minister had an opportunity to study the report—by a number of correspondents of national newspapers in recent weeks, including the 	<i>News of the World,</i> of prisoners who have indicated that they would sooner go to prison than pay the fine?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not studied that publication, but the point to which my hon. Friend refers has a direct bearing upon the period of imprisonment that Parliament thinks it right to enable the courts to impose in circumstances where fine default has occurred. If it be the case that people believe that it is worth going to prison for the maximum period prescribed by Parliament, that means that Parliament should look carefully at that issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must correct an earlier remark. I understand that more than 17,000 people were sent to prison for fine default in 1979. That is an enormous number of people when originally the court sentenced them to a fine and not to imprisonment. How many are actually in prison now for fine defaulting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not studied the count this morning, but the receptions into prison in 1979 for fine defaulters were 16,692, in 1980 they were 14,976 —but that was distorted by the prison officers' industrial action. Those figures must be compared
	<span class='label label-info column'>510</span>
with the total number of fines imposed. In 1979, 206,700 fines were imposed and there were 16,692 receptions into prison. In 1980, when just under 15,000 receptions into prison occurred, there were 220,000 fines. We are talking about a small proportion. The comparison is very marked and significant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point arising out of what my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendali) said, is that once a fine defaulter has been committed—I hope that the hon. Lady will listen to this point-to prison for not paying a fine, the fine is usually paid very quickly indeed, which is evidence of the efficacy of the sanction of imprisonment as a last resort for default.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have dealt adequately with the points that have been made about the first of the new clauses. We want to ensure that the courts have available to them as much information as they can reasonably obtain about the means of the accused before he is convicted, but it is important to proceed carefully and not to impose a statutory obligation that might have unsatisfactory consequences that would not achieve what is required.

New clause 2 relates to attachment of earnings orders, which are currently available under the 1971 Act. They apply to various payments that may be ordered to be made by magistrates' courts, including maintenance payments, fines, costs, compensation and so on. Under section 3 of the Act, application for an attachment of earnings order may be made either by the person to whom the payment ordered by the court must be made, or by the person ordered to make the payment. The person ordered to make the payment may apply for an order to be made at any time, including the time that a sum is ordered to be paid. But for an order to be made upon the application of any other person, it must appear to the court that default has occurred in one or more payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of new clause 2 would be that an attachment of earnings might be made in respect of a fine at the time of conviction instead of after a default in payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid that we cannot accept the need for a provision along the lines of the new clause. Since 1971, the power of magistrates' courts to make attachment of earnings orders to enforce the payment of fines has been placed within the context of their powers to make such orders to enforce other payments, of which perhaps the most important are maintenance payments. Other than where the person ordered to make the payment asks the court to make an attachment of earnings order, it is common to all such payments that the court must be satisfied that default has occurred before such an order can be made. There is no obvious reason for excluding fines from such a framework by making special provision for a court to make an attachment of earnings order at the time of conviction where it deals with an offender by the imposition of a fine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another consideration of significance is that the making of an attachment of earnings order immediately relieves the offender of any responsibility for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>511</span>
disciplining himself to make the payments into court to meet the fine. That job is passed to the employer. I see no reason why that should be done until the offender has shown himself unable or unwilling to meet his obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are considering the fine not as a revenue-collecting measure but primarily—indeed, almost entirely—as a way of imposing an appropriate punishment. That consideration has some significance. In addition, there will be cases in which a defendant has not informed his employer of an impending appearance in court for fear that he will be dismissed if he is convicted. It would be wrong in principle to give the court a power, to be exercised at the same time as it imposed a fine, not only to tell the employer of the defendant's conviction but to place the employer under an obligation to the court. If the defendant's fears about his employer's attitude are genuine, he should be given the opportunity to meet his obligations to pay the fine voluntarily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened carefully to the hon. Lady, but I believe that this would not be an appropriate addition to the law. I hope that I have persuaded the Committee that there are sound grounds, however attractively the new clauses have been advanced, to reject them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hoped that it would have been possible to announce that the pilot schemes that I had suggested—which he supported as long ago as May last year—could have been seen to have been operating today.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Watkins. I am sorry to have to raise a certain matter at this stage and in this way, but unfortunately I have no other option.

We should be about to discuss new clause 3, which was provisionally selected with new clauses 51 and 52. Those proposals would amend the provisions of the Street Offences Act 1959 as they relate to prostitution. You will know, Mr. Watkins, that new clauses 3, 36, 51 and 52 have been on our list of selections since we began our Committee proceedings. In fact, they were on the very first list of selections early in February. This morning the clerk very courteously indicated to me that new clauses 51 and 52 had been deselected. I thought that that concept applied only in the Labour Party, and I must admit that it worried me when the clerk said at 29 minutes past ten this morning " I have deselected two of them ". I have not had an opportunity to ask him privately—or indeed publicly— why that has happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that we are not about to debate new clause 3 with new clauses 51 and 52 linked to it, perhaps you could give me some guidance, Mr. Watkins, why we cannot attempt to amend the Street Offences Act in relation to the term " common prostitute" and the evidence that is required from police officers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

New clause 3 would amend section 1 of the Street Offences Act 1959, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>" It shall be an offence for a common prostitute to loiter or solicit in a street or public place for the purpose of prostitution ".</p></blockquote>
It lays down that there shall be a maximum penalty of three months' imprisonment for a third or subsequent conviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1980, the last year for which we have figures available, 183 women were received into custody after an immediate sentence of imprisonment. Sixty-five of them were aged under 21. A further 55 were received into prison in default of payment of a fine for soliciting, of which 17 were aged under 21. The figure would have been considerably higher had it not been for the effects of the prison officers' dispute. Nevertheless, I accept that we are not dealing with large, dramatic numbers, or that the removal of the sanction of imprisonment for the offence of soliciting will substantially affect the prison population. I am prepared to argue the case in the terms that it will be a small, marginal and therefore welcome help towards relieving pressure and the overcrowding of the prison population. That, however, is not my reason for advancing this desirable reform —I do so on the merits of the case as it relates to prostitution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First of all, it is significant that no men were imprisoned or even convicted last year, the year before or the year before that for the highly objectionable and offensive action of kerb-crawling, which hon. Members know is a very unpalatable feature of many of the inner areas of our major cities. There are many hon. Members in the House representing areas in Bradford, Wolverhampton, Southampton, Liverpool and Birmingham who have made repeated representations to various Home Secretaries to do something about that offensive action. Yet not one of those men engaged in kerb-crawling or soliciting and annoying women in red-light areas has ever been prosecuted, convicted, or been in prison, whereas every year nearly 200 women are imprisoned for what is essentially the same kind of offence and the same kind of public annoyance or disruption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present law is clearly discriminatory. It is only the prostitutes, and not her client, who is subject to the law and its penalties. New clause 3 would make the offence of soliciting non-imprison-able. It gives effect to a recommendation of the parliamentary all-party Penal Affairs Group in its report " Too Many Prisoners " published in 1980. Everyone inside and outside the House agrees that the imprisonment of prostitutes is harsh, unnecessary and pointless. It is certainly the view of many representative organisations—for example, the prison and borstal officers' branch of the Society of Civil and Public Servants. It is the view of prison officers, probation officers, social workers and the Police Federation. In formal evidence to the former Ex
	<span class='label label-info column'>514</span>
penditure Committee, when it was taking evidence on the pressure on the prison population, the Police Federation representative stated quite clearly that the majority of these involved are
	<br><blockquote><p>" inadequate by virtue of a variety of health, mental or other reasons … and are in need of medical help, which the present prison sentences do not give."</p></blockquote>
The federation recommended that the offence of soliciting should not carry a prison sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an unusual degree of unanimity, which exists for three main reasons. First, it is now acknowledged and accepted that prison does not rehabilitate those who are sentenced to it. The Home Office working party on vagrancy and street offences, in its report published in 1974, commented in paragraph 251:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>" We do not consider that any rehabilitative value it might have is sufficient reason for making it available … It is usually the least successful prostitutes who get sent to prison—a prostitute who becomes successfully established is less likely to have to ply her trade in the streets— and their problems are so great that it is difficult to do anything to help them in a short period in prison …"</p></blockquote>
It continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>" The prison service does not see itself as having a useful rehabilitative role to play."</p></blockquote>
The general view of most of those concerned with, involved in and knowledgeable about both penal institutions and soliciting is that prison does not serve any sensible, justifiable purpose for these women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it is acknowledged that prison, or the threat of imprisonment, is not a deterrent to soliciting or prostitution. The problem of street offences by prostitutes is generally confined to those women who would not be deterred by the threat of a relatively short prison sentence. Indeed, evidence was given to both our Committees on " Too Many Prisoners " and previous Committees of the House that the higher class—if one can use that expression— more successful prostitute is not touched by the law. She is ensconced in comfortable, secure surroundings and can carry on her occupation without the disadvantages that accrue to the street prostitute, without the same kind of threat and without the same kind of fear of being arrested, convicted and imprisoned. It does not in any way deter that kind of prostitute. It is, therefore, a nonsense to suggest that the ending of the sanction of imprisonment will mean that there will be a veritable flood of prostitutes on to the streets to solicit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not true that the woman who practises her prostitution from her own premises—which is not a brothel and, therefore, not illegal—is not affected, which shows that the objectionable nature of the offence is not the prostitution or the aggravation of public morals but simply the public nuisance of the prostitute on the street? If it simply is a public nuisance, is it really any more serious than begging, which we are now arguing should not be subject to imprisonment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept entirely what my hon. Friend has said and that, indeed, was the point that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0421">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>515</span>
I made earlier. It is assumed—perhaps it is true— that it is the nuisance and annoyance of the offence of prostitutes soliciting on the streets that is undesirable. If that is true, it applies with equal force, and perhaps to a greater extent, to the men who kerb crawl, harass, approach and annoy other— if one likes to use the expression—decent women in that area. That, too, is equally offensive and disturbing and it reinforces the point my hon. Friend has made. Yet they are not arrested, convicted or given prison sentences. I shall suggest later a means whereby the annoyance that my hon. Friend mentioned can be overcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third reason why it is now generally agreed that imprisonment for prostitution should be ended is, as Dr. Megan Bull, the governor of Holloway prison, pointed out in evidence to the Expenditure Committee, that many of the prostitutes in Holloway often use their sojourn in prison to recruit younger, non-prostitute girls to the profession. If there is any demand or desire to prevent young girls who happen to be offenders for other reasons—theft, or whatever—from entering a life of prostitution, it would seem sensible to keep them out of prison and away from the influence of other convicted street prostitutes. Dr. Megan Bull certainly gave evidence to the Expenditure Committee that recruitment to prostitution took place in Holloway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those three main reasons, but for others as well, the Penal Affairs Group concluded that no purpose was served in imprisoning prostitutes, that it was counterproductive and that it should end. We also believe that it would make, as I said at the beginning, a small but welcome contribution to reducing the prison population and overcrowding, particularly in the context of the evidence that was collected by Professor Gibbons, published as long ago as 1971. It was found that of the women admitted to Holloway for soliciting large numbers had histories of mental breakdown, suicide, alcoholism, drug dependency and a variety of physical disorders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the main, the picture which is painted of the street prostitute who gets herself arrested and imprisoned is one of someone who is physically— mentally in some cases—disabled or suffering from some disability, but very largely disadvantaged, inadequate and frequently inarticulate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I briefly make two points on the two new clauses not selected, the reasons for which I understand? They are part of the whole scenario of the law on soliciting. We recommend in our report " Too Many Prisoners" that there should be no conviction of a prostitute on the evidence of one police officer. That proposal was contained in new clause 52. The rationale of the law is that it is there to control annoyance. The annoyance of the public cannot be so bad if no single member of the public is prepared to go to court and give evidence of the annoyance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to be unreasonable and unfair that women can be convicted on the evidence of a single police officer, on the basis of the charge that they are in some way annoying the public, when no member of the public can be found who
	<span class='label label-info column'>516</span>
is willing and able to go to court. If that kind of consideration applies in other areas, as it does, it seems sensible and reasonable that it should also apply in this area. We shall certainly seek another opportunity at another time to put the law right in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the main thrust of the hon. Gentleman's argument, but I am not sure that he is right in saying that the offence for which the women are being brought before the court is that of annoying other members of the public. The offence is soliciting, and that does not necessitate annoying anybody. Soliciting is simply soliciting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right, but in practice the only reason that soliciting is an offence and subject to a potential sentence of imprisonment is that it annoys or is offensive to other members of the public. It is not a matter of morals, because prostitution itself is not illegal. As my hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Lyon) pointed out in his intervention in another context, it is because it causes distress, offence and annoyance to members of the public. That being the case, it does not seem unreasonable to say that those members of the public who are offended, annoyed and distressed should be required to give the evidence of their annoyance and distress in court, just as they would in any other case of which they complained and which they brought. If the hon. Gentleman had assaulted one of my constituents, my constituent would be required to make that complaint about the assault and to go to court and give evidence. Why should not the same kind of consideration apply in the area we refer to here?
<br><br><!-- lb -->

When a woman is brought into court she is referred to as a common prostitute. We are not suggesting any substantive change in the law; just the change of an offensive word. If you are brought before the court, Mr. Watkins, as a thief with a previous record, you are not referred to as a " common thief " or a " common burglar " or a " common vandal ", and there is no reason—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope to be referred to as a " common Chairman" and I hope the hon. Gentleman will observe the common rules of order of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My problem, Mr. Watkins, is that you are an uncommonly awake Chairman— particularly as this Committee goes.

also consider it offensive. It is a cosmetic change and no more, but a cosmetic change that is important. I know that the Minister cannot make that change today but he could at least give the assurance that he will make it in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Opposition will also support my plea, in my capacity as chairman of the all-party penal affairs group, for the ending of imprisonment for soliciting.

It is a great pleasure to be able, for a change, to associate myself almost wholly with what the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) has said this morning. I should like, if I may risk the Chairman's wrath, without mentioning any new clause that has not yet been called, to associate myself particularly with the hon. Gentleman's plea to my hon. and learned Friend to look at the word of the court charge. The words " common prostitute "—particularly now that prostitution itself is not illegal—are unnecessary, superfluous and damaging. I hope that he will consider carefully, before Report, altering the wording of the charge to a more normal format.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the substance of new clause 3 and new clause 36, I entirely agree that these should not be imprisonable offences, but we, as a Committee and as a House, must not lose sight of the fact that street soliciting, as opposed to any other form of prostitution, can be a great nuisance to the public. Some of the areas where ladies of the street operate are places where families go for meals and where people must be able to go about their normal evening tasks or evening enjoyment without running the risk of an offensive approach in terms which they might not welcome. It is, therefore, important that the Committee should not appear to endorse street prostitution by saying that the people concerned should none the less not be imprisoned for doing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The risks, as every member of the Committee knows, to everybody on our streets are growing as the hours go by. The muggings and the criminal and violent attacks that take place in our streets need no further encouragement. In many areas of our major cities it is simply not safe to go out at night. I say that for two reasons that are relevant to the new clause.

The first is that it is important that nothing should be done to render the streets more dangerous for ordinary, peaceful persons walking about in the course of their ordinary lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the safety of the prostitutes themselves is a factor. There is no doubt that street prostitutes are vulnerable to attack. They are vulnerable to the kind of kerb-crawling that the hon. Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column'>518</span>
mentioned, and the kerb-crawlers themselves are frequently the source of attack on and of fearful injury to the prostitutes. I am therefore reluctant to do anything which might encourage the growth of violence in our streets and the putting of these ladies in greater danger, albeit that it is a risk of which they are well aware.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two elements which we as a Committee must watch are those of nuisance to the public and of danger to the prostitutes themselves. For those reasons, it is important that the law is not left at a level at which it would be an inefficient deterrent to street prostitution. I hope that my hon. and learned Friend will abolish the imprisonable element of this offence but will increase the fine level to one which would be in itself a successful deterrent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that it is right to say that many of the ladies of the street have always been managed in groups by pimps, who take a large cut of the takings of the night. The danger, if the level of the fine is too low, is that those gentlemen, or those ladies— or whoever organises these matters—will be prepared to ride a fine of £50 or £200 as part of the ordinary, everyday risk of running such an operation, and will pay it himself or herself, and that the prostitute will not be in any way affected by that fine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall tread warily in claiming more detailed knowledge that my hon. Friend in this matter, but I wonder whether he is under the misapprehension that the sort of prostitute about whom we are talking is earning so much that £50, of £200, is not a serious penalty. We are talking about what one may call the bottom end of the market. I understand that for these women £50, and certainly £200, will already be a very serious penalty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his intervention. I imagine that his knowledge may well be greater than mine in this field. My point is precisely the opposite to the one that I may have given the impression of making. I am not at all suggesting that the level of that fine would not be a serious matter for the prostitute concerned. I am suggesting that there are groups of girls working together in concert, and with an organiser, usually called a pimp—although in these days perhaps it is more likely to be the managing director of a perfectly reputable company—who takes a large chunk of the profits. In respect of the gentleman or lady who heads the organisation, it is important that the level of the fine should be adequate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman looks into thematter, I think he will see that in most instances the courts do not impose the maximum fine. If it is in the discretion of the courts not to impose the maximum fine, presumably the courts have some reason for doing this. I should have thought that his plea that the fine should be increased is therefore at variance with the practice of the courts themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. None the less, it is the discretion of the court that I am considering, and not any average level that the fine might turn out to be. The discretion of the court arises when the evidence before it is that it is part of an organised syndicate in one area. Should such evidence come before the court, it is important that its discretion to deal with it effectively and fully should be within its power. Unless the fine is increased—particularly with the rate of inflation which we are now unfortunately suffer, in common with most other European countries—the level of fine is inadequate to deter the organisers, although it would be perfectly adequate to deter the individual operator. I hope that has expressed my view reasonably succinctly, and that the Minister will take note of these amendments, whether he can accept them in their present form or will wish to substitute some other suitable proposal. I hope that imprisonment will be removed as one of the sanctions that can be used for this offence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Pitt 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly in support of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk). I am delighted to see the degree of unanimity that appears to exist throughout the Committee. I should like to say, first, how much I wish to be associated with the hon. Member's remarks about men soliciting. Fortunately, in my constituency we are not subject to that sort of thing, but there are areas of south London where kerb-crawling by males in cars is an extremely offensive pastime. We have, however, as the hon. Gentleman has said, no record of any convictions of those gentlemen. The ladies concerned, on the other hand, are not only considerably at risk to violence, as the hon. Member for Nantwich (Sir Nicholas Bonsor) has said; they are also at risk from the activities of the people who are soliciting them. That seems not only to be an immoral situation but rather a silly one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Considering the arguments against imprisoning people for prostitution, it is clear that imprisonment has no deterrent or rehabilitative effect. In fact, all the staff organisations of prisons agree that no good is done to prostitutes by locking them up. The Prison Officers' Association has said that prostitutes do not see themselves as criminals. They are able to sail through their sentences and go on doing what they have always done, so prison will not have any effect on them from that point of view. Their presence, as the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) has already said, is likely to have a destructive effect upon other female prisoners who have not been recruited to the business of prostitution but who, because of economic or other circumstances, could well be recruited to prostitution by women who are already in prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many prostitutes have children who go into care when their mother is sentenced to prison, which clearly has a highly disruptive effect on the children and the mother. In addition, many people who are prostitutes—as has been pointed out by PROs, a prostitutes' organisation—are, to use the vernacular,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>520</span>
" on the game " in order to support their children, and prison will not deter them from trying to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every organisation concerned, from the Police Federation to the Prison Officers' Association to the Howard League for Penal Reform—which would seem to encompass the whole gamut of the problem —has recommended that imprisonment for soliciting should be ended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument that soliciting is a nuisance to many people has not been borne out by fact. As we have seen here this morning, a nuisance can be committed by someone merely standing waiting for custom, and yet those who crawl past her in their motor cars, or who clog up the pavement by their own presence in looking for a prostitute, would be immune.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will either accept the new clauses as they stand or give us an assurance that he will bring forward on Report a measure which will take completely into account the message that we have tried to put over this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Sheila Faith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belper)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I greatly regret that, unlike the previous speakers, I cannot support the new clauses. I respect the humane motives of the hon. Members who have put them forward. I agree with the need to reduce the prison population. I know that prisons are overcrowded and very unpleasant places indeed, to put it mildly. I do not feel superior to anyone else, or " holier than thou ". I know that these women have not had educational advantages and that many of them work in order to give their children those very advantages. However, I think it is misguided to say that it could cause psychological trauma as well as the possibility of separation, when the mother goes to prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Members for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) and Nantwich (Sir N. Bonsor) that the label " common prostitute" should be withdrawn. The women concerned are certainly denied a fair hearing in court. I consider that men who kerb-crawl and accost women also pollute the moral atmosphere, and that they should be eligible for penalties similar to those given to prostitutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike other hon. Members present, I can remember what it was like in our cities before the Street Offences Act 1959 became law. Prostitutes were very much in evidence and many women were subject to embarrassment at being accosted. I know that steps are being taken to improve the moral climate of some of the areas in our cities. Today, new controls are being imposed on sex shops, and my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sains-bury), in the Indecent Display (Control) Act 1981, has effected some improvement, but nevertheless the climate in some parts is still not satisfactory. I think the public would never forgive the Committee if by our action today there were to be an increase in the number of women standing on our streets for the purpose of prostitution. It is not only a serious nuisance; it can be a danger to young people who come to live in our cities looking for work, or for a more interesting life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to explore to what extent we disagree. Does my hon. Friend agree that it is highly undesirable for the prostitutes to be sent to prison—200, I believe, this year—particularly in the light of the comment she made about the traumatic effect that that has on any child? Secondly, does she agree that a very much higher fine would itself be a formidable deterrent against the crime?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Faith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to the fine later. I think that fines are not a suitable deterrent, and regretfully I have to say that I consider that prison sentences should continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Lady any evidence that imprisonment is, in fact, a deterrent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Faith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that later. When I joined the Committee, the hon. Member referred to my experience as a magistrate in Newcastle upon Tyne. Unlike some other courts, Newcastle applies the law vigorously and imposes imprisonment. That has been shown to deter prostitutes from coming into the area from Glasgow, as had been the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that two cautions have to be given and two fines imposed before a prostitute is imprisoned. Only three a week are imprisoned in the whole of England and Wales, and imprisonment is usually only for one month. It is an important point that while these women are in prison the opportunity is there for them to be examined for sexually transmitted diseases. We know that those diseases are growing in the country, so it is a preventive measure. The girls who are on the streets are the least likely of all prostitutes to come forward themselves for treatment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady suggest that we should also sentence their clients to prison for the same purpose of finding sexually transmitted diseases?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Faith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has a point that needs to be considered. The Magistrates' Association says that imprisonment is the only real deterrent and that the fine acts only as extra income tax; the level of fine is not really relevant. The subject was
	<span class='label label-info column'>522</span>
debated at the annual general meeting of the Magistrates' Association in October 1977, when a proposal similar to new clauses 3 and 36 was defeated by 118 votes to 44.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the council meeting of the Magistrates' Association on 15 November, the question whether the offence of loitering or soliciting for the purposes of prostitution should still carry a sentence of imprisonment on third conviction was referred to the Committee for consideration. That proposition, on being put to the vote, was lost. Sir Lindsay Ring, a former Lord Mayor of London, in urging very strongly the retention of imprisonment, pointed out the difficulties with which magistrates in London and other large cities were faced. In his experience, prostitution was often a front for other evils, and in many cases fining merely meant that the girl went back on the streets in order to obtain the money to pay the fine.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Jo Richardson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was surprise and disappointed at the contribution of the hon. Member for Belper (Mrs. Faith),whom I considered to be a sort of liberal in social quarters. I listened very carefully to what she had to say but could not hear any evidence that imprisonment was, in fact, the way to cope with this problem. It seems to me that she was really trying to argue against to me that she was really trying to argue against prostitution, which is not really the subject of the clause; we are talking about soliciting and the effects of soliciting and how the problem should be dealt with. Nor did I understand or agree with the West(Mr. Pitt),who seemed to suggest that everyplace in he world might have kerb-crawlers except croydon.
