	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, South and Finsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause relates to the manner in which inquests are conducted. I am proposing that the Lord Chancellor should have power to appoint a special coroner, so that some inquests may be taken by the special coroner rather than by the normal coroner for the area in which the body is found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, coroners have jurisdiction on a geographical basis. They are appointed by the local authorities. Many have some medical training and some legal training, and all have one or the other. But there are some cases where, because of great public interest or the sensitive nature of the case or for other reasons—perhaps a difficulty expected during the hearing—where it would be more appropriate for the inquest to be conducted by a person of much higher standing. In the new clause, I have suggested that that person might be either a Higher Court judge or a circuit judge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
High Court judges at present have the general jurisdiction of coroners, but they have no geographical jurisdiction. The legislation on coroners during the past 100 years or so has ensured that any particular case is considered by one of the coroners for the area in question, so I do not know how a High Court judge could come into the act except in an unusual circumstance which I shall mention. It is not enough to say that High Court judges are at present coroners. They may be coroners but they are not coroners for any particular case. There seems to be no way by which anyone else, or a High Court judge himself, can take a particular case
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
to himself, to be heard by him and not by the normal coroner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause does not reflect on the quality and the work of normal coroners. They do an excellent job. They are, I believe, the right people to conduct 99-9 per cent, of the cases. I suggest only that there is an occasional case, perhaps one in 10 years, where, for one reason or other, a need is felt for a higher level of person to be in charge of an inquest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a new idea. It has been raised three or four times in the House. I have raised it at Question Time and in the course of debates, and other hon. Members have done the same. I have found, in talking principally to lawyers in the House—it is perhaps significant that lawyers have this reaction—that they have a sympathetic attitude to the proposal that some cases should be tried by a High Court or other judge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Brodrick report on coroners' work, so far as I recollect, rather stressed the importance in many cases of the coroner having not only some medical knowledge but the skills required for conducting a judicial hearing. In the past year or two, two particular cases have given rise to some concern about the lack of such facilities—the Blair Peach case and the Deptford fire case. The Deptford fire case is the subject of court proceedings at the moment, and I should not want in any case to go into detail about it. But I do not think that it is sub judice in the course of our considering this proposal for legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to base my case on those two incidents because one was—perhaps both of them were—conducted properly, whatever people felt about the outcome. Even if the Deptford fire case inquest turns out to have been conducted wrongly in some respects—we have yet to find that out—the remedy may be the one that has been taken, which is to have the verdict of the inquest quashed in the High Court. Some people may suggest that as that facility exists for quashing a verdict in the High Court, there is no need to do anything else. I do not think so. I am suggesting that we should anticipate difficulties which might occur by having a particular case heard in the normal way, and avoid those difficulties before they occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is particularly important to do that, because even if an inquest verdict is quashed by the High Court, the practice—I am not sure whether this has to be the practice—is for the High Court to quash the verdict and require a new inquest to take place by a named coroner. But I understand that the named coroner is, as a matter of practice, one of the normal named coroners for that county. I do not think that there has been a precedent for the High Court, in quashing an inquest verdict, to appoint a High Court judge to take the substitute inquest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From conversations with the Law Officers, I understand that there is doubt whether, at least in those circumstances, the High Court could name a High Court judge to take the second inquest. But even if it could do so, where a motion had been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0032">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
made in the High Court to quash a verdict, it would still not deal with the problem that I am getting at, which is how to avoid an unsatisfactory inquest hearing. Therefore, it would be taken to a higher level without taking it first at a lower level and going through the business of quashing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is always worth referring, in matters of English law, to Scottish practice. In Scotland, what we call inquests are not conducted by a coroner. I do not think that there is such a person as a coroner north of the border. Inquests are conducted in the sheriff court. Therefore, it is possible to conduct them either in a lowish level way or in a more elevated way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently, there was a case in Scotland, in either Dunfermline or Kirkcaldy where a large number of deaths occurred in a nurses' home after a fire. Instead of the case being heard in the sheriff court with simply the local procurator fiscal presenting the case, the Solicitor-General for Scotland presented the case. That is not an exact parallel, because in that case we are talking of bumping up the quality of the person who presents the case. The person conducting the inquiry remains the same, namely the sheriff principal or sheriff. There is a choice north of the border between handling the matter in a regular and routine fashion, or in a more highfalutin fashion for important or sensitive cases. That is what I seek south of the border in a different form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause says:
	<br><q><p>" In any case where an event has occurred which but for this section would entitle or require a coroner to exercise his functions, the Lord Chancellor may appoint a special coroner."</p></q>
I have not sought to define the circumstances where it would be appropriate for the Lord Chancellor to use that power. I do not think that that can be done. The power should be left entirely to the discretion of the Lord Chancellor, after whatever representations are made by the Law Officers or other persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may find precise words to limit the Lord Chancellor's power. We could say that it should be used in a case of great public importance or of general significance, using the sort of concept now used to distinguish cases taken by a coroner alone or with a jury. But there could be all sorts of relevant considerations about whether it was desirable to have a High Court judge on a particular case. It might be a matter of great public importance or political sensivity. There might be general circumstances to consider—the people involved, and the anticipated difficulty arising from the people involved. It would be impossible to find words in a statute to define the circumstances precisely, yet not be too narrow. On the other hand, if we put in limiting words which were so vague that they were elastic, there would be no point in putting them in at all. It would be better to leave the matter to the Lord Chancellor's discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not suggested that the decision should be taken at the request of persons with merely an interest in the hearing. They are not legimitate requesters for this purpose. It would often be the Law
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
Officers, conceivably the Home Office and possibly the police who perceived a particular need in a case. I would leave it entirely to the discretion of the Lord Chancellor, recognising, of course, that the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General would often have a role to play in making representations to the Lord Chancellor that it was appropriate for him to use his power in a particular case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled an amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill similar to this new clause. It was held to be outside the scope of the Bill. In it, I said that it should be the Home Secretary rather than the Lord Chancellor making the appointment. The Home Secretary is responsible for legislation on coroners, not the law officers or the Lord Chancellor. The appointment of a judicial person to hold an inquiry or trial is a function which really belongs more happily to the Lord Chancellor than to the Home Secretary or the Home Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pretty sure about those aspects of new clause 4, but in other cases we may be able to achieve the objectives in a slightly different way. For instance, should the power of appointment be limited to a High Court judge, or go down as low as a circuit judge or county court judge?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be necessary to provide in the drafting for the new coroner to have jurisdiction over the particular incident—I think that I have provided for that in the new clause—and also to call off the normal coroner, which has not been done here. That will probably be necessary. Although I do not agree that parliamentary draftsmen are essential to the drafting of all legislation, this is not the sort of matter on which I should expect to get the drafting exactly right myself. But that can be taken care of later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Solicitor-General is therefore able to tell the Committee that, in principle, he agrees that in some cases it should be possible for a High Court judge, a circuit judge or a county court judge to take an inquest under the normal rules of inquests—not conducting a special type of inquiry. I hope, too, that he will throw light on whether that could happen without any change in the law and say that, if it turns out that it cannot happen under the law, he agrees that the law ought to be changed to allow it to happen and that it should be done in the Bill, although not in this Standing Committee, at a later stage on the Floor of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Accrington) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be very brief, because the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Cunningham) has introduced his new clause thoroughly, competently and very fairly. Like him, I hope that the Solicitor-General will be able to support fully the principle of the new clause, if not its detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman did, I praise coroners for the competent way in which they carry out the bulk of their duties. No one complains about 99 per cent, of the decisions that they make or the way in which they handle cases. But, inevitably, there is, and will always be, the occasional case which, by its very nature, is highly charged and sensitive, where
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0033">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
perhaps accusations are made against the police whether merited or not, and where the full panoply of the adversarial system by which our court proceedings are conducted come into play. In the bulk of cases, the coroner carries out an inquisitorial procedure, but in cases such as Deptford, where there is a full array of counsel, very detailed cross-examination and an aggressive manner of carrying out the adversarial system, the overwhelming number of coroners, because of their training and the way in which they carry out the bulk of their duties, are not necessarily the best people to carry out such procedures. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that, in such cases, someone who is skilled in carrying out procedures conducted by the adversarial system at its best should decide, and clearly a circuit judge or High Court judge is a most suitable person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member suggested that the Lord Chancellor should appoint the coroner. He may be right. But I can see some difficulties because no criteria are laid down. The hon. Gentleman does not wish to lay down criteria. I understand that, and I can see the difficulty that a Lord Chancellor would face with constant pressure for a case to be sent to a special coroner. If there is no way of distinguishing between them, I can see him running into pressure and difficulty, although perhaps he is competent to deal with it. A possible way of dealing with it—this is only a suggestion; I do not say that it is necessarily the correct way—is for an application to be made to the High Court itself for it to decide whether a special coroner should be appointed in any given case. I am interested in hearing the Solicitor-General's views on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that I need take the argument further. The hon. Gentleman has made every possible point in its favour and in my view the case is overwhelming. The proposal will apply to a limited range of cases only and in view of the disquiet that has been expressed over the odd case which is inevitably given stark headlines, something of the sort proposed by the hon. Gentleman should be brought into being to relieve any public unease about the existing system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General (Sir Ian Percival)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Cunningham) was good enough to tell the Attorney-General and me exactly what he had in mind. We had what I hope the hon. Gentleman feels was a useful discussion, and I am obliged to him for the reasonable way in which he presents the arguments, although I do not mean to sound patronising by using the word " reasonable". The hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) has behaved in the same way. I believe that they are struggling towards an answer to something about which there is disquiet, although perhaps it is not easy to define exactly what is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should make it clear, as the Attorney-General and I did to the hon. Gentleman, what is not embraced, and I express sympathy for what I believe lies behind the amendment. We are greatly opposed to any suggestion that there should be a turning back of the clock over the issues to be dealt with at inquests. Civil liability has always been excluded
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
from an inquest, but until quite recently criminal liability was very much an issue and a jury could commit a person for trial. I believe that we all agree that it was right to get rid of that, and any suggestion to return to it would be frowned on by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been suggestions that we should have a new half-way house—something that is half-way between a coroner's inquest and a full-blooded trial— but I should be profoundly opposed to that, too. Furthermore, any suggestion that a High court judge was intrinsically more suitable to try to hold every kind of inquest would be wrong. The hon. Gentleman referred to the Brodrick inquiry which reminded us so clearly that there may be cases where the expertise required is quite different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, having said that in order to make clear what I am not saying, I recognise, as does my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General, that there could be cases for which a different kind of skill and experience was required. I have in mind such cases in which the skill and experience required is in the direction and control of the proceedings, which can be a most expert matter when it is necessary, in the interests of justice as a whole, that a proper procedure is devised and followed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the area about which I recognise there is disquiet, and it is a question to which we should try to seek an answer. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman drew a distinction between that and the review of inquest proceedings, which is quite another matter. The question whether a High Court judge or someone else should be appointed to take a second inquest when a first inquest has been quashed is quite a different matter, as the hon. Gentleman said. We shall have some guidance on those matters when judgement is delivered in the case currently before the Divisional court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn, as both hon. Members did, to the practical question of how we can meet that. I am reminded that all the judges of the High Court have the jurisdiction of coroners throughout England and Wales. At first sight, that appears to offer a fairly simple avenue without legislation, but, as I have already told the hon. Gentleman, it is a long time since that power was exercised, if ever. I simply cannot tell the Committee how that jurisdiction can be brought into effect or who has to do what in order to ensure that a High Court judge may exercise that jurisdiction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will know that inquiries are to be held to find the answer to that question, but it is only one of the questions that have to be answered. If that question can be answered, we may have a possibility to consider in regard to mechanics, but that is not the only aspect that has to be considered. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that it is essential that my noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor should consult the judges, especially the Lord Chief Justice, and the Home Secretary, because if there is to be a system it might be right. They would be necessarily involved in its practicality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another possibility. I am talking about the possible appointment by the Lord Chancellor,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0034">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>51</span>
in accordance with the hon. Gentleman's amendment. The hon. and learned Member for Accring-ton raised another possibility, namely, that the Act should be judicial rather than administrative and there should be a right to apply to the High Court for the appointment of a judge for special reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A difficulty could arise from what the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury said, namely that the High Court should not necessarily become involved as the result of an application by an interested party. Perhaps that could be done better on the motion of whoever had that right on advice of those involved, probably the Law Officers. If we adopted the procedure referred to by the hon. and learned Member for Accrington, we would have to ask who could apply and on what ground. I do not exclude the suggestion for that reason, but I hope that I have illustrated that, before proceeding, there should be discussion with those involvd in implementing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall do my best to discuss the matter with those who instruct me between now and Report to clarify what I have said. I shall try to let the hon. Gentleman know whether there is any machinery for bringing into effect the jurisdiction which we believe that High Court judges have. I shall tell him about the consultations, if any, that we have had. I am sure that he will appreciate that that is the most I can say in my desire to be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Peter Archer 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warley, West) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether, when the Solicitor-General conducts his consultations, he will include two other matters that sometimes leave people with a sense of injustice at the end of an inquest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there is the right of representation for members of the family and people whose names have been ventilated. At present, it is at the coroner's discretion. If the matter is ventilated publicly, such people sometimes feel that they have not had an opportunity to state their case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is the question of legal aid for that purpose. I see that it is already available by statute in schedule 1 of the 1974 Act, and I wonder whether the Solicitor-General will consider the possibility of activating that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will see that those points are brought to the attention of my right hon. Friends who will be responsible for the next stage. As the Committee knows, I am speaking merely as an agent for my noble and learned Friend. There is the problem that if one tries to consider too many matters, more consultations will be required which are apt to go on for too long. One small bite of the cherry concluded speedily may be better than a big bite carried out over a long period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those matters are now on record, and I am sure that they will receive attention. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel that what I have said is of some assistance, but it is the most that I can say at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful for the sympathetic response of the Solicitor-General. I certainly did not intend to press the matter to a vote and shall not do so, because this is a first trot over the ground. I hope that the next trot over the ground will take place on Report and that a satisfactory conclusion will be reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If present law allows the appointment of a High Court judge, we need discuss only whether, and how, the law is used. I based my assumption that it was not allowed on previous statements—for example, a reply by the Minister of State, Home Office to a Question tabled by the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price), on 9 July 1981:
	<br><q><p>" High Court judges already have the powers of coroners. Fundamental changes "— </p></q>
the changes that one does not feel inclined to make at a given time—
	<br><q><p>" in the procedure of coroners' courts would be needed to enable judges to act as coroners."</p></q>
He picked a particular example:
	<br><q><p>" Legislation would be required to enable a judge to take over from a coroner who had already opened an inquest, which he usually does within a very short time of the death." —[	<i>Official Report</i>, 9 July 1981; Vol. 1212, c. 570.] </p></q>
That is a real difficulty, and one would have to provide not only for the anticipation and calling off of a normal coroner's inquest but for its supplanting by a High Court judge after it had been started. Although one would like to avoid that, the speed with which coroners act might prevent one from doing so. On the basis of that reply and of other remarks, I assumed that the present law did not allow the appointment of a High Court judge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 34 of the Coroners Act 1887 states: " Nothing in this Act"—which provided for coroners' jurisdiction and other matters—
	<br><q><p>" shall prejudice the jurisdiction of a judge exercising the jurisdiction of a coroner by virtue of his office, and such judge may, notwithstanding the passing of this Act, exercise any jurisdiction, statutable or otherwise, previously exercisable by him, in the same manner as if this Act had not passed."</p></q>
It therefore seems that although a High Court judge cannot be got to act as coroner, his powers of coroner are firmly based in traditional English law. Such a basis is always an excellent starting point for changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it may sound slightly churlish to the Solicitor-General, who gave a sympathetic and helpful reply, I am sorry that the Lord Chancellor and the Home Secretary have not hitherto been moved to form an opinion on the matter. The point is not new. It was raised in an amendment that I tabled to the Criminal Justice Bill, and the present new clause was tabled some time ago.

I recognise that it is asking a lot to hope to get consultations on such amendments, especially to Bills originating in another place, done and dusted before the end of Report. However, the idea has been around and the new clause on the Amendment

Paper for some time, and the consultations that have not, apparently, taken place should be completed before Report so that we can be clear whether the practice is allowed and is sometimes operated. If we discover that the practice is not operated we shall be clear that we must change the present law in the Bill. There is unlikely to be another appropriate Bill during this Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be easy for the experts—although not for me—to draft an appropriate amendment, and I beg that consultations be proceeded with quickly and intensely so that we can make an affirmative decision on Report. Otherwise we shall have no chance to make the amendment.

	<p>" After section 22(2) of the Justices of the Peace Act 1979 there shall be inserted a new subsection (2A) as follows: —
	<br><q><p>' Where there is a separate magistrates' courts committee for an area to which section 19(2)(a) applies which is divided into petty sessional divisions, the clerk to the justices for any of the petty sessional divisions as the committee might select shall by virtue of his office be the clerk to the committee.'." —	<i>[Mr. Archer.]</i></p></q></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause stands in the name of the hon. Member for Plymouth, Drake (Miss Fookes). Unhappily, she is absent from our deliberations, so what was originally intended by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) and me as a little demonstration of support has turned to have rather more importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause deals with magistrates' courts committees. A magistrates' courts committee is a committee of magistrates which decides what is required by way of court accommodation, court staff, training for justices and staff, and generally the servicing of magistrates' courts in its area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a magistrates' courts committee decides what is required, the local authority has to provide the finance. So the local authority is landed with the bill for decisions taken by the magistrates' courts committee. The local authority is consulted before the decision is taken, and there is provision for formal consultation, and if, subsequently, the local authority objects to certain expenditure which has been called for by the magistrates' courts committee, it may appeal to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clerk to the committee may be either the justices' clerk for the area or the clerk to the local authority, or it may be someone else. It is usually either the justices' clerk or the clerk to the local authority. I believe that there are three arguments why it should be the clerk to the justices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
First, the clerk to the justices is a trained lawyer —normally, of course, so is the clerk to the local authority, but his expertise will normally lie in a different area. The clerk to the justices has experience in the law which is administered in the magistrates' courts. He is, therefore, familiar with the issues and the difficulties which are likely to arise from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the clerk to the justices is the man who has to administer the magistrates' courts. He knows their needs because he is dealing with them every day. He is the clerk to other committees of magistrates, and so no one is more familiar with what is required than the clerk to the justices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, if the clerk to the local authority is clerk to the committee, he may have divided loyalties. The magistrates' courts committee may wish to invite certain expenditure. The local authority, quite understandably, may well wish to resist it. The magistrates may then feel that the clerk's primary loyalty is to the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give one example. I do not even know anything which would identify the individual concerned, so fortunately I do not have to decide whether to give anything away. I have no intention of identifying anyone. A magistrates' courts committee decided to change a number of salaries of the staff in a magistrates' court. Under section 56 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1979, the committee had to consult the local authority before taking a final decision about that expenditure. It therefore instructed its clerk to communicate that fact to the clerk to the local authority, who was, of course, himself. So he took it to his own local authority and the local authority refused to agree to that expenditure. So the clerk to the local authority communicated that to the clerk to the magistrates' courts committee—again himself—and he went back with the information to the magistrates' courts committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The magistrates' courts committee decided that it was not persuaded by the objections of the local authority, and it made a formal determination, which it instructed its clerk to pass on to the clerk to the local authority. He passed it on to the local authority, which decided to exercise its right of appeal to the Home Secretary. The clerk to the local authority was placed in the position of being an official both to the local authority and to the magistrates' courts committee. In one capacity he was arguing that the requirement for the expenditure on salaries was right and proper, and in his other capacity he was having to argue that it was totally wrong and unjustifiable. It was an impossible position in which to place an official.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair to say that there are some arguments for the other view. Following the Local Government Act 1972, which precipitated the problem in relation to counties, the Home Office published circular 130/ 73. As it was expressed with a succinctness which does not always categorise Home Office circulars, I cannot do better than read to the Committee what it said on this subject. It said that the Secretary of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0036">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>55</span>
State wished to remind magistrates' courts that they had this discretion and then said:
	<br><q><p>" The Magistrates' Association have expressed the view that a justices' clerk should hold this post on the grounds (a) that the committee should be entirely independent of the local authority and that this is not possible if the clerk of the committee is also clerk of the local authority, 	<i>(b)</i> that difficulties can arise, in the event of a disagreement between the committee and the local authority, if the same person holds both posts and (c) that with the abolition of the office of clerk of the peace by the Courts Act 1971, clerks of local authorities will increasingly have less direct knowledge of the courts ".</p></q>
The circular then added, quite fairly:
	<br><q><p>" It is understood that while members of the Central Council of Magistrates' Courts Committees support this view, the council itself considers that the selection of the clerk should be at the discretion of the committee ".</p></q>
It then proceeds:
	<br><q><p>" On the other hand, the County Councils Association has expressed the view that the clerk of the local authority is, in view of his other responsibilities, in the better position to ensure the fullest possible co-operation between the committee and the local authority which is responsible for meeting the committee's expenditure. Committees will no doubt wish to bear these considerations in mind in deciding whom to appoint."</p></q>
I take the point made by the circular, which seems to be the only point in favour of appointing the clerk to the local authority, that that might ensure a smoother relationship with the local authority. But that is open to the comment that it might result in too good a relationship with the local authority. If it has a clerk who feels that he is bound always to advise the committee to minimise expenditure, that may not be the best way to ensure the fullest possible administration of justice in the magistrates' court. There is very little evidence that there are difficult relations with the local authority, even where the clerk is clerk to the justices, because he has every interest in having the smoothest possible relations with the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following that circular, of 89 magistrates' courts' committees in England and Wales, 63 have appointed the justices' clerk, 22 have appointed a local authority official and four have appointed someone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to add to one pragmatic argument. The clerk to the local authority is a very busy man who has many other commitments. It is less likely that he would give a great deal of his time and attention to this function than if the appointment were the clerk to the justices, whose whole life is filled by the matters deliberated upon by the committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the weight of argument is in favour of this function being discharged by the justices' clerk. Clearly the hon. Member for Plymouth, Drake was of that view, too, which is no doubt why she tabled this new clause. I am content, for the moment, to leave the matter there, because, if I may adopt the words of the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury, this is a preliminary canter over the ground; we have not ventilated the matter before, I should be interested to hear the Solicitor-General's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the case put for the amendment. It might be suggested that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
magistrates are perfectly capable of deciding for themselves in each case which of the two ought to be their clerk, but on balance I am persuaded that that freedom should not be left to them. There is, first, the view of the Magistrates' Association, which can be expected to look at the matter in a magisterial way rather than a local government way. Because so many magistrates are or have been councillors and have a somewhat local government approach to these matters, in some areas they have a tendency to incline towards the use of the county clerk rather than a normal magistrates' clerk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. and learned Member for Warley, West (Mr. Archer) suggested that in many cases the county clerk would be some kind of lawyer, but even that possibility is diminishing. There is a greater tendency these days for local authority chief executives to be not lawyers but pure administrators—if one can put it in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In making clear that the court service is not a function of local government but quite independent of it, we should all prefer that magistrates' courts should use their own clerks as the clerks of the committees. If we are sure that that is what we want them to do, it would not be wrong to remove the freedom to do otherwise, to guard against the few cases where there may be too much local govern-ment-mindedness, as against court-mindedness, on the Bench.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a very short point at stake here. Wherever a unit of local government is one petty sessional area, the law now says that the clerk to the justices shall be the clerk to the magistrates' courts committee. We are talking only about areas which have more than one petty sessional area. In such areas, there is a free choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the difficulties to which the right hon. and learned Member for Warley, West (Mr. Archer) referred will arise from time to time. There will be differences of opinion about how much money shall be spent for a particular purpose. The Government's answer is that the remedy for that is in the hands of the magistrates' courts committee. The committee may have in its area a justices' clerk who it thinks would be good at the job and who is willing to do it. That is not unimportant. It is all very well for some justices' clerks to say " I should like to do the job", but one must look at the area where the question arises. It may be a large area, broken up, and the justices' clerk whom the magistrates' courts committee would like to do the job may say " No, I cannot", or " Yes, I am glad to do so."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, the magistrates' courts committee has the choice. The Government have made no secret that they actively welcome the appointment of justices' clerks when the magistrates' courts committee, where it has an option, decides to appoint them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. and learned Gentleman has referred to the circular, which I mentioned briefly, as encouraging the appointment of the justices' clerk and his involvement in matters concerning the magistrates' courts committee. But the matter is not so clearly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0037">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
black and white as either the right hon. and learned Gentleman or the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury said. There is another body, the Central Council of Magistrates' Courts Committees. I leave it to hon. Members to follow up with that body the details of its opinion if that is desired. It may then be found that the central council takes a different view. I say only that, for hon. Gentlemen to arrive at a firmer view, they may like to see what the council thinks. It is the magistrates' courts committees that are stuck with carrying out Parliament's decision. If Parliament says that the committee's choice must be restricted to one of the justices' clerks for one of the petty sessional divisions in the area, it will be important to have the view of those committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall go into no more detail than that, as magistrates' courts committees have not had much time to express a view, but they may well take a quite different view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Though what I have had to say on behalf of the Government is brief, I believe it to be a convincing argument. We must leave the choice to the magistrates' courts committee, which is the body that has to do the job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Solicitor-General for the fair way in which he put the arguments. I was a little surprised at his suggestion that justices' clerks may not be prepared to do the job. A specific clerk in a specific area may be less than willing, but this proposal has the support of the Justices Clerks' Society, so I doubt whether that reluctance will be widespread. However, I accept that further consultations may be necessary, and I would not wish to attempt to bounce the Committee into a decision this morning. Therefore, I shall not press the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr, George Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that it is right not to press the matter to a vote now, but I shouiu not like all the Solicitor-General's remarks to pass uncontested. There is certainly a logicality in saying that where there is only one justices' clerk who may fill the post, we do not leave it to the magistrates to make the choice between him or someone else. But where there is a choice of several justices' clerks, we leave the magistrates to choose not only from those several justices' clerks but between them and someone else. There is no logic in that. We should say either that it is entirely up to the magistrates or that they are bound to choose a justices' clerk. That is the essential distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The distinction between the areas in which there are several justices' clerks and those in which there is only one, is minor by comparison. Therefore, all logic suggests that, as we have decided that in most cases magistrates will not be free to choose someone other than a justices' clerk, there is no sense in leaving them free to choose someone other than a justices' clerk only on the ground that they already have a choice between several justices' clerks. I hope that the Solicitor-General will take that into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>DISCLOSURE OF DOCUMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<br><q><p>" The obligation to protect and maintain the confidentiality of the contents of a document disclosed to a party to litigation or his solicitors shall terminate if and to the extent that the contents of the documents are read aloud in open court in proceedings which are not subject to any limitation on reporting.".—	<i>[Mr. Archer.]</i></p></q></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter has been debated previously in both this place, on the Contempt of Court Bill last year, and another place on this Bill. Normally, the proceedings of our courts are public, and we are proud of that principle. The whole world can hear what transpires in the course of our dispensing justice. It is only rarely that anything occurs of which we might have reason to be ashamed. When it does, steps can be taken to ensure that it is not repeated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I approve, as I think does the Committee, of the activities of those who report our court proceedings; not only the official law reporters, but those who report them for the general public. Those of us concerned in cases have frequently attempted to assist reporters, in the interests of accuracy, by showing them a document containing a name or quotation, or perhaps a list of statistics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, there must be exceptions to that principle. The process of discovery is a valuable aid to justice, and it is proper that when a document has been disclosed, it should be used by the party and his or her advisers to whom it is disclosed solely for the purpose of those procceed-ceedings. But conflict arises where a document is read aloud in open court. Surely then it is open to the whole world. There can no longer be a question of breach of confidence, because it is no longer a confidential document. Anyone who has heard it read may cry its contents aloud from the roof tops. If a reporter has been present in court and has managed to take down what was said when the document was read, he may publish it to the whole of his readership. There is one exception. The party or his solicitor alone are sworn to secrecy. They may not reveal it to anyone or show the document to a reporter in order to assist him to record its contents more accurately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems to me to land us in the absurd position that a document can be public property and that anyone in the world can be free to record its contents except the party to the proceedings and his solicitor. That seems to me to defy all reason and logic. It is impossible to explain to non-lawyers the reason for such an extraordinary rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dispute has been ventilated so frequently that I do not propose to deploy the arguments now or later because they are well known to the Committee. In another place, the Lord Chancellor said that he was consulting about this in accordance with an undertaking that he had given. He explained,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0038">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>59</span>
perfectly properly, that he could not have begun his consultations earlier because certain proceedings were still taking place and the matter was sub judice. I accept that consultations are now proceeding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two purposes at this stage in moving the new clause. The first is that it may enable the Solicitor-General to give us an interim report, so to speak, on the consultations. We would all like to know who is being consulted, approximately how long the consultations are expected to take, when it is likely that some sort of information will be available and, broadly, what we can be told about the thinking that has been expressed so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I believe that it would assist the Lord Chancellor to have the view of the Committee on the subject. Those are the reasons for our ventila-ing the matter at this stage. This is not, in the words of the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Cunningham), a preliminary canter. We are treading a very well-worn path. We are treading in the footsteps of those who have planted their feet very firmly here on past occasions. If the Solicitor-General cannot give the Committee a full account this morning, we may wish to return to the matter later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Christopher Price 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my right hon. and learned Friend said, new clause 6 is about the seventeenth canter round the course. None the less, it is worth having because the House will go cantering round the course until a Government of whatever party finally put right this absurd situation, for which I put no responsibility on the Law Officers of the Crown. The fact that a well-known case was brought in the first place was, in my view, a mistaken decision by the legal adviser to the Home Office. I accept completely that the Law Officers have absolutely no control, when an action is taking place, over the specific activities of Departments of State. But I think that they should have, because it is absurd for a Department of State to pursue what turns out to be a massive court action that concerns a possible breach of the European convention without being forced to consult the machinery of government before proceeding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken about this before, so I shall say no more. I hope that the Solicitor General will consider trying to get a bit of a grip on some of the legal advisers in Departments, because they have acted like cowboys from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make two other points, one of which my right hon. and learned Friend made. What I think was the most absurd part of the Diplock judgment in the House of Lords was the idea of dividing people who report court proceedings into sheep and goats, saying that there were good, reliable court reporters in category A, but that there were unreliable court reporters, especially such people as David Leigh of the 	<i>Guardian.</i> That was not explicit in the judgment, but it was implied in what Lord Diplock had to say. The courts apparently need to guard against such people, to whom presentation of material by, say, Harriet Harman, caused her to commit an offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
If we consider that idea for two minutes, we must see that it is the silliest ever propounded by a Law Lord in a House of Lords judgment. It is impossible to enforce. Perhaps there have been sillier ideas, but that is among the silliest statements ever made in a court. It is impossible to enforce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot define openness in this way. Either our courts are to be open, or they are to be closed. But it is absurd to make them half open and say " You can report so much," or " These people can report, but those cannot." The Solicitor-General— and the Lord Chancellor, too, as he is said to be consulting on the matter—should have some sense of urgency in trying to rid English law of this concept. Such a judgment displays a complete lack of understanding of the job of a journalist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Diplock was really saying that it would have been all right if Miss Harman had shown the document for the purposes of a law report in 	<i>The Times,</i> or another publication, but that it was not all right for someone to comment on them. In other words, Lord Diplock said " You can report what happens in my court so long as you do not comment on it, but the moment you start to comment on it, you cannot report the basic facts." That is idiotic. I hope that the Solicitor-General will manage to allude to that in his remarks to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have another point to make on the issue. It concerns the effect of the Home Office action. That prevented Parliament from knowing about, and discussing, matters which it was absolutely proper for Parliament to know about. The conditions in the control unit of Wakefield prison were at the nub of the Harman case. It must be proper, and a matter of public policy, for Parliament and the public to know of certain facts and to have access to them, whatever the Home Office's legal advisers may think. It is becoming a propensity of the law to say " We are going to operate secret justice in this area not because it would interfere in some way with the normal course of justice—but because, say, discovery is an important power and people will not produce documents if we do not." The law is saying that there is never to be a balance of public policy —which requires openness—against closed justice for the convenience of the mechanisms of the law. It happened again four weeks ago in Nottingham, in the Rampton trial. Judge John Hopkin used a section of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 to interfere with parliamentary processes in the House of Commons. I thought that I was wide awake in the Committee which considered that Bill, but I must have been too fast asleep to notice the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trial of the Rampton nurses was proceeding at the same time as the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill was in Committee in the House of Commons, and the Government were defeated on a number of occasions in the House of Commons on the facts. If there had been open justice for the Rampton nurses at Nottingham, the legislation passed by the House would have been quite different and, in my view, a great deal better. Because a single judge decided on the basis of the dreadful Contempt of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>61</span>
Court Act 1981 to institute closed justice instead of open justice at Nottingham, we now have a different law in the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I simply mention that because what is continually pressed on us in the House is that we must not erode the sub judice rule because it is terribly important that the processes of the courts go on unalloyed. I maintain that that principle works both ways and that the courts must not so use opportunities to create closed justice that they interfere with the processes of the High Count of Parliament here in Westminster. I find absolutely no understanding among our judiciary or our legal luminaries in general that there is a balance in the matter. If we in Parliament respect the processes of the courts, they, too, in regard to many issues such as the trial of the nurses at Rampton or the conditions in Wakefield prison—which was what, in effect, the Harman amendment was about—must respect Parliament's right to know so that, when we pass legislation, we may do so in full knowledge of the facts. That is why a proper exception to the sub judice rule is that it shall not interefere with Parliament's right to legislate in any way. Therefore, I do not believe that I am breaking the sub judice rule as I would be were we not legislating. I do not know how much is sub judice any longer, but I am pleased at that exception to the rule so that I may make that sort of comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In essence, the House of Lords judgment was Diplock v. Scarman. It was Diplock saying " It has absolutely nothing to do with the convention that we signed in Europe to have a proper .?ense of openness ", and Scarman saying " Yes, that is central to the whole issue."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but I have allowed him to discuss the Nottingham case at length. It is not the sub judice rule that I am worried about but the fact that the hon. Gentleman is straying wide of the clause, which has a precise function to put right what some regard as a wrong decision. It is rather more limited than the hon. Gentleman sought to show.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You know me, Mr. English. I would not stray for very long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Diplock judgment was about the Harman case, which would be put right were the new clause included in the Bill. The two sides of the argument are Lord Diplock saying that the processes of the law are so sacrosanct that issues of public policy and our responsibilities to the European convention cannot override them except in the most massive way, and Lord Scarman saying that our responsibilities to the European convention are substantial and that mere processes of the law should not be allowed to override them. That appears to be the imbalance that we seek to correct with the new clause and, were we to pass it, I believe that we would right a substantial injustice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I recognise that to a certain extent the Solicitor-General is beholden to his noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor who, it is alleged, is consulting. I should like to know who he is consulting, for how long he will be consulting, when he
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
will finish that process, and, when he has finished, what the Government's intentions are in general. Do they intend to legislate in some way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Lyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemel Hempstead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to carry the argument away from the Harman case and scrutinise it in principle. I believe that there are profound reasons for the present rules on confidentiality of discovery and the balance between what can be reported when it is mentioned in open court and what can be done with documents which have to be disclosed on discovery which have not been fully ventilated in the Committee. They are very important to the maintenance of our system of justice. I speak with particular experience of work in our civil courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee with legal experience and those without will know how reluctant people often are to bring their cases before the courts and before our system of justice not because of the issues involved in the case but often because they are fearful that other matters in their private affairs, which we, their advisers, often think they have no need to worry about, anyway, will come out into the light. That fear influences them deeply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a principle of discovery that all relevant documents have to be disclosed to one's opponent for the purposes of the action but not for any other purpose. As a result, in a large commercial case, twenties of thousands of documents may be disclosed, and, as in some of the long cases in which I have been involved, may be read in whole or in part in open court. If outsiders were allowed to rummage through those documents, whether for commercial or journalistic purposes, they might provide a gold-mine for outside interests. That gives the profoundest worries to the litigants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all agree that it is important that our justice should be conducted in public and that what goes on in court should be reported. To' that extent, the private litigant has to run the risk of his or her documents being read in open court and the reading of them being reported and being used for any purpose for which those who sit and listen in court choose to use them, with the sole exception of the rare cases held in camera. That is the only way in which one can stop such matters being reported in a civil case, with perhaps the rarest exception of some patent cases.

If all those documents came into the public domain simply because they were read in court, which would be the effect of the clause—they might do so as a result of a lack of good will or the carelessness or generosity of a solicitor or anybody with control of the documents on the other side—that could be, and in my view would be, a real disincentive to the proper ventilation in court of important justiciable issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

protect, and commercial privacy, which again I would not be against. Indeed, the United States is trying to find mechanisms of protection in its Freedom of Information Act. Will the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all understand the distinction which the hon. Gentleman seeks to> draw. It sounds persuasive in the way that he puts it, but we should go down that road with considerable caution. He developed his argument by saying that the workings of Parliament were hampered by the non-availability of information which might have become available through litigation. But I wonder whether, if Parliament has inadequate ways of obtaining information which should be available to it, we should weaken the processes of justice to remedy that defect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman. I wished to invite his view on a narrower point. I have followed his argument closely and I was a little puzzled at his anxiety that when a document is read aloud in court, it enters the public domain. The fact is that at that moment it does enter the public domain. Anyone who heard it read, except the other party to the proceedings and his solicitor can read its contents in every ale house in England. Is that not absurd?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the right hon. and learned Gentleman's point, but I think that the answer to the question is " No ", because in this type of case, those who frequent the ale houses of England often become bored before the conclusion of the litigation, and therefore the problems—as obviously the Committee recognises from its reception of my remarks— for the personal litigant and the commercial litigant, seldom arise in practice. Therefore the balance between the openness of our justice and the need to preserve some confidentiality in our justiciable affairs is reasonably maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To change the rules in the way that the new clause would change them would unseat the balance to the profound long-term disadvantage of both systems which we seek in this Committee to preserve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to follow the hon. and learned Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Lyell) because he has tried to distil some principles to guide us. I take the view of the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price) on the particular case, but in most matters a case can be made on the other side. In this it is important to try to construct a set of circumstances which
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
maximise the attraction of the opposite view, and then see whether one is prepared to accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The kind of circumstances that I imagine in order to do that would be something like this. If I am involved in personal litigation and to hear the case properly it is found necessary for some extremely personal letters of mine to be produced in open court, there is no way that I can prevent that, assuming that it is necessary for it to be done. My attitude in those circumstances would be that it may be necessary for a proper hearing and determination of that case for those extremely personal letters to be produced and read in court, but once that has been done and the requirements of the litigation are thereby satisfied, I would ask " Why should I be exposed to further publicity of those letters, which is not required for satisfactory determination of the litigation? " I think that I would have a complaint—I think that we would all complain—if it were held as a general principle, that there had to be freedom more broadly to publicise the documents than was required for the purposes of the litigation. That is the best set of circumstances that I can imagine to justify the hon. and learned Gentleman's view. Having imagined it, however, I conclude that the interests of tidiness, logic and general principle require one to overcome it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the point that there is a freedom to publicise the documents, with the exception of a limited number of people who cannot exercise that freedom? If it is in the public interest that documents should not be publicised, do we not require a different approach to law reform?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to suggest that, though not so much on the basis mentioned by the right hon. and learned Member. In the circumstances that I have just described, I should feel that the publicity necessary for the purposes of the hearing had to be accepted. But that is no reason to impose unnecessary publicity by the adoption of rules likely to secure greater publicity than would otherwise occur. It is a nice matter—certainly an untidy matter—to distinguish between publicity arising from someone happening to be in court and repeating what he heard, whether in ale houses or otherwise, and more specific measures for giving publicity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The illogicality that impels me to override that consideration is that information and documents read out in court following discovery are not the only pieces of information stated in court only because litigation is taking place. I might be a witness in court and be obliged to answer questions which are extremely embarrassing to me. No discovery would be involved. I would merely be required to answer questions and give information which, if used outside, might embarrass me. No protection exists on that score.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we want to say that information used in court, whether as a result of discovery or otherwise, should not be usable outside for any purpose other than the reporting of the court proceedings in the normal way, we would have to cover information of that kind also, and not confine the provision to matters produced on discovery. As we do not do that, I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>65</span>
find it doubly impossible to justify, first, the distinction between the publicity necessarily following from matters being read out in court and that resulting from the conscious pushing out of publicity about them, and, secondly, the distinction between information which is read out in court as a result of a discovery process and information provided in court not by a discovery process but, which is perhaps, equally embarrassing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a difficult matter. Like all difficult matters, it is a 60:40 case—I have never come across a 100:0 case; there are no such cases worth talking about— but the ratio is 60:40 in favour of the new clause rather than against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall start by explaining what the debate is not about. With great respect to the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price) it is not about attempts to prevent Parliament from discussing matters. He referred to the Nottingham case. I remind the committee that that judge did what he did under the power in section 4(2) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981, which says:
	<br><q><p>" In any such proceedings the court may, where it appears to be necessary for avoiding a substantial risk of prejudice to the administration of justice in those proceedings, or in any other proceedings pending or imminent, order that the publication of any report of the proceedings … be postponed for such period as the court thinks necessary ".</p></q>
That is why the hon. Gentleman did not query it during the passage of the Bill. It is a perfectly sensible provision in the interests of the administration of justice. He was not asleep. He was wide awake and he thought that it was a good provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are often conflicting interests. The judge had to decide whether it was in the interests of the administration of justice and whether there was a substantial risk of prejudice. He concluded that there was. That is what that case was about and this debate is not about. Nor is it about freedom of the press, freedom of speech, confidentiality of documents or documents in the public domain. One way of providing the protection to which the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Cunningham) referred, is to hold the proceedings in camera. But again there is a conflict of interests. The court will afford that protection only when the case for it is overwhelming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all those matters there is a conflict of interest. Once a document has been read in open court, all questions of freedom of reporting, freedom cf speech, confidentiality and documents in the public domain go. If someone reports what is said or obtains a transcript and reports it, provided that he does it accurately, he is totally free to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are considering something different—an implied duty on a solicitor who receives documents which belong to someone else. In the interests of justice, that someone else is obliged to disclose the documents. The solicitor into whose hands the documents are given should not use them for any other purpose. When it is stated in that way, it is hard to fault the principle. Why should not the solicitor be so restricted? From the point of view of the person whose documents they are, why should not the person to whom they are disclosed be under
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
that duty? He is entirely free to use them for the purposes of the case, but not for any other purpose. What is wrong with that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Harriet Harman case, the documents were not handed over for the purpose of an accurate report. If a reporter in court had said " I want to report a certain passage. Can I have a peep at the documents to make sure that I get it right?", the court may have said that technically it was contempt but that it would not take any notice. But in the Harman case, the whole bundle of documents was handed over, regardless of whether each had been read, not for the purpose of reporting the trial, but for the purpose of an article about life in prison. The Harriet Harman case is about whether a solicitor, to whom other people's documents are committed, perhaps against the will of the other person, should be under any lesser duty than he has been for as long as memory stretches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can give a progress report, for which I have been asked, on the consultations. What is intended, and is well advanced, is a reference to the Law Reform Committee. Everyone who has a view is free to submit it directly to my noble, right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor. If they have not yet done so, they have only themselve to blame for the delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What else should my noble, right hon. and learned Friend do? He proposes to make a reference to the Law Reform Committee. The precise terms of reference are not yet agreed, but their substance is to consider the rule as I have outlined it, and to recommend whether there should be changes in the law or practice relating to that rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As with all other consultations, if others wish to be consulted, it is in their hands and they know to whom their representations should be sent. I hope that they will send them quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because I am not versed in the speedy ways of the Law Reform Committee, can the Solicitor-General give the par for the course of the Law Reform Committee's recommendations?

	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not blame the hon. Gentleman for asking that question. He would be even more surprised than I would be if I attempted to answer it. I have been giving estimates of time in court and elsewhere for long enough not to stick out my neck. All that I can say is that the speed of outside consultation lies with others. If all those representations have been made and if it is believed that the Government or the Law Reform Committee are not getting on quickly enough, that would be the time to stick pins in the appropriate places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Fins-bury saw a case for saying that the only time disclosure by the court or solicitor should be permissible is when somebody has to disclose documents that he might not want disclosed, but when it is right to do so in the interests of the administration of justice. There is a good case for saying that for the reasons given by my hon. and learned
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>67</span>
Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Lyell), but it would immediately conflict with the even more important principle of open justice. We cannot reconcile both those interests, but that does not mean that we should not try to find something which affords a measure of protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Fins-bury say that it would be a good thing to avoid unnecessary publicity—publicity which would not otherwise have occurred—although publicity cannot be avoided entirely and that this was a step in that direction. Many of the documents will be read in court with no one there to pay attention to them. But if the solicitor were free to say " I want some publicity for that document coming from the other side " or if the client were to say that he wanted some publicity and gave the document to a newspaper reporter there would be unnecessary publication not otherwise occurring, just as the hon. Gentleman said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause guards against that. It is not a complete safeguard, but it is some sort of safeguard. Most solicitors would say that it is an effective safeguard in practice. The rule has never been doubted by solicitors, so far as I know, until this recent case. They have fully accepted that, when they obtain other people's documents they must be used only for the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me remind the Committee that this is a two-way business. Each solicitor, when he hands over documents to his opposite number, expects him to use them only for the purposes of the case, and would be rightly horrified if they were used for any other purposes. He accepts the same obligation. That is what the Law Reform Committee, and everyone else, must consider. I have thought it right to place those views and a progress report on record. I hope that those who want to express further views will do so quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am deeply disturbed by that because it was almost as though I had before me Lord Diplock, and not the Solicitor-General. I am sure that the Solicitor-General takes that as a compliment, but the House of Lords divided on the case as nearly down the middle as five persons can but as wide apart—miles apart—as in any recent judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My criticism of the Solicitor-General's speech— although I have enormous respect for him—was that it was the speech of someone who has spent his adult life in the law. I insist that the problem affects not only lawyers, but ordinary people, journ-lists and parliamentarians. I shall illustrate how journalists are affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Journalists have a tradition in the courts. I have not done much court reporting, although I have done some from time to time. I sat throughout the ABC case in the October when we all thought that there would be a general election, but there was not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Journalists have difficulty in reporting the law. Fundamentally, they have three choices. The first is to get themselves into a little team, having gone
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
to a superb shorthand writing school when young, and keep wrists of steel for three or four hours at a time and write shorthand constantly. That is alternative A. A few of the real professionals can do that, but, if one is honest, a small minority of journalists who report the law ever even try to do that. Lawyers kid themselves and are being completely unfair in suggesting that every journalist should be able to do that. The number of individuals who can do what our superb 	<i>Hansard</i> shorthand writers in the House can do is very limited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alternative B is to pal up with the lawyers involved and sit there and take the odd note. That is the common method of reporting law cases. The journalists try to take the occasional note when the case seems to be interesting, go out for a cup of tea when it becomes boring, and go back later to take another note. They then find that their note has gaps in it. When having their cup of tea in the Old Bailey they perhaps sit next to the solicitor in the case and they ask, " How do you spell Smith? Is it ' Smith' or ' Smyth'? " The Solicitor is no doubt committing an appalling contempt by telling them how to spell the name but most solicitors would. The journalist then says, " I took down half the document that was read but I did not get down the rest." In 99 per cent, of cases the solicitor says, " Oh, yes, there it is. Take it." A law report takes up only about four or five column inches in a newspaper. If the case were reported verbatim, it would take up about 20,000 column inches. So we are talking of extracting material to that tiny extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, a journalist wants the nuggets of gold in the public evidence. Sometimes those nuggets are hewn with the greatest difficulty, through the processes of discovery, out of the private domain into the public domain. That is the second way, the common way. I say that, knowing a little about journalism and having journalists as freinds. That is the normal way that journalists try to be accurate in their reporting of court proceedings and try to get it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a third way, which is where the Solicitor-General comes in. He will remember the Contempt of Court Act 1982. During discussion on the Bill I moved an amendment very persuasively. It was a little late at night and I suspect that the hon. and learned Gentleman's colleagues were a little more persuadable because it was after dinner. Anyway, the hon. Member for Louth (Mr. Brotherton) and all the others come flooding over to my side when I suggested that the tape recorder did no more nor less than shorthand used to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tape recorder is simply an easy way, through the processes of modern technology, of taking down shorthand. That is why we have all the microphones and the recording machine in the Committee. I suggested that journalists should be allowed to take tape recorders into court. The Solicitor-General will remember this. His hon. and learned Friend, the Minister, seeing that he would be defeated, gave me a pledge in Committee, which he then ratted on. I do not blame him at all, but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0043">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>69</span>
he breached the pledge because he could not persuade the Lord Chancellor who was in charge of the business. He simply had to come back on Report and say " Sorry ". The hon. Member for Louth voted against his own party on the Floor of the House because of that breach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government had accepted my amendment on tape recording, I would feel far less upset about this amendment. If I as a journalist could take a tape recorder into sensitive as well as unsensitive cases, much of the problem would be overcome, because I would have my version of what is read out in the public domain, just as the solicitor has his version, which the Solicitor-General says is private.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happened instead? A practice direction was issued by the Master of the Rolls and all the heads of the various courts—which I shall never understand—in this country. The practice direction has taken us a little way. There have been some very good judgments as a result of it. Tape recorders are coming into court in quite large numbers now, and I am pleased about that. But because the practice direction is hedged with so many ifs and buts, one knows that if another Harman case were to come to court before one or two judges, whose names I could mention but I shall not, the small print of the practice direction would be used to ban the tape recorder in court and to try to prevent matter which is clearly in the public domain in relation to the ale houses which have been mentioned, but not for the conscientious reporter who, deprived of his tape recorder, knows that his only means of getting the facts is to go to the relevant solicitor and get the information down on paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Solicitor-General had been a journalist all his life and had been committed to openness, instead of a lawyer committed to the privacy of discovery and all the rules surrounding discovery—and I am not criticising him—he might have a slightly different perspective. The House of Commons is saturated with lawyers. In my view we got it wrong on the Contempt of Court Act 1981 and, however long the Law Reform Committee takes, I do not trust it to have a journalists's perspective. In any event, I suspect that, if we go down that road, it will be many years before we get anywhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right step is for Parliament to legislate. The Committee does not seem as stroppy and difficult as the Committee considering the Contempt of Court Bill and it appears to intend to support the Government on this issue. It might be wise not to press the matter to a division now but to have another debate on Report. Sending the matter to the Law Reform Committee is pigeon-holing it. One day both lawyers and laymen in Parliament should stand up to be counted and legislate on the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I tend to agree that there is not always a need for legislators to have the advice of such bodies before deciding to legislate. It is extremely valuable in some instances, not necessary in others and positively undesirable in some.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
However, I do not take the view that it is undesirable for such a body to consider this matter. Is the law Reform Committee the right one in this instance? I was not aware that the issue was to go to the Law Reform Committee, my knowledge of which is next to nil. I am advised that it does not contain any lay people and that its normal work is largely in rather abstruse points of civil laws. That may include some abstruse points which appear in the Bill. I am not sure that that sounds like the kind of body that will provide balance. The Solicitor-General said that we must balance the interests of the litigants and the public interest in openness of Government and court decisions. The Law Reform Committee does not seem likely to balance those different considerations. I am told that the Law Commission has work in hand on breach of confidence and has given some attention to the Harman case. I believe that it would be preferable for the Law Commission to be involved, if only in addition to the consideration that will be given by the Law Reform Committee. I should like to hear the Solicitor-General's view on the chances of the Law Commission either being moved to take an interest in the matter or to do so without being moved—not necessarily to the exclusion of the Law Reform Committee, but supplementary to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price) went overboard in his criticism of lawyers and said that we are committed to secrecy. Committed to secrecy be blowed! We have a degree of disclosure in this country which is quite unknown on the Continent. When acting for a continental client, it is difficult to persuade him that he must open his files and disgorge documents. I know that at first hand and other hon. Members may have experienced the same. The Solicitor has to go over with a team for days and turn out the client's filing cabinet. He must tell the client that it must be done as it is part of the system but that the document will be used for the purpose of the action only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A lawyer practising in the common law in England protects the privacy of the individual. That is something with which the hon. Gentleman would sympathise. I often describe the purpose of the English common law as being to protect the weak from the strong. The strong do not need laws as they can look after themselves so laws are needed to protect the weak from the strong. That is the philosophy of our common law. Sometimes the individual is weak and the journalist is strong, so the argument is not all one-sided. That is the philosophy which we are taught is the basis of English common law and that is how we try to practise it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea that we try to ensure secrecy is so far from the truth that I felt that I must make that comment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is hard to apply that principle in this case. In this case there was not a 100 per cent, view that the solicitor in question was wrong. There was quite a view that she was not wrong in doing what she did, yet she went through an action that clarified the law as it now stands and was obliged to meet costs for a purpose
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0044">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
which amounts to legislation—clarifying the law at it stands now. In that case it was certainly not the weak being protected against the strong but very much the opposite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, there are different views about different cases. I was commenting in general terms on the criticism that we lawyers deal in secrecy. That criticism is totally unfounded. If people believe that they would be right to have less confidence in the system, but happily most people generally speaking, have great confidence in the system. That should not stop us from criticising it but make us be sure that our criticisms are well merited and not exaggerated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the practicalities. I hope that the hon. Member for Lewisham, West will not mind me saying that to him. He expresses his views to me quite freely, which is what it is all about, so he will recognise that I am just as free to do the same in return. The hon. Gentleman talked about what happens in court and I referred to the fact that there is never any trouble with the reporters in court. In my experience, if they want to quote a passage they will usually approach the owner of the document and not another party. If a reporter wants to quote something from my documents he will come to me. They are my documents, I would give him permission to use them and there would be no trouble because we all prefer accuracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that were the reporter to approach the other chap he would say " I just want to make sure that I have the passage right". Strictly speaking, that would be a breach of the rule but no one would take any notice of it. Therefore, in practice those difficulties do not arise when reporters have listened to something in court, wish to report it and get it right, and ask such questions in the interests of full and accurate reporting. I am glad to assure the Committee from personal experience that, in practice, there is no difficulty—so long as the desire to look at documents is for that reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been careful not to express any views about the rights and wrongs of the particular case, but the difference is that the disclosure was not for that purpose. It was to enable someone to write an article. That is so far beyond anything embraced by that rule about disclosure, that it raises the question of whether we should maintain the rule. I hope that those comments restore the balance a little.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Lewisham, West asked an interesting question about tape recording. I believe that the practice that is now emerging will be carefully considered by the committee that will advise the Government. Although the hon. Gentleman did not get his way on the Contempt of Court Act 1981, it specifically refers to recordings and makes it clear that a judge may give leave in any case, or refuse it. The hon. Gentleman may say that the power should not be as wide as that, but I am happy to say that the courts have used their powers wisely and effectively. My guess is that whenever they think that leave is being sought in the interests of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
full and accurate reporting they grant it. I cannot imagine them not doing so, but how that is working out may be of interest to those who want to make representations and the committee which has to decide on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the question asked by the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Cunningham), the Law Reform Committee will consider the matter. The Law Commission was invited to take on the reference and some might have thought that it was a more suitable body. I am not expressing a view about one or the other, but I can see that some might say that its composition and method of working are more suitable—that is a matter of opinion. However, its present programme of work is such that it would not have been able to undertake the task for quite a long time and certainly not for another year. The Law Reform Committee was chosen because it is free to start in October.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not catch whether the Solicitor-General said that the Law Commission had been invited—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Its members are all busy men—judges, barristers, solicitors, and one academic. Lord Lloyd of Hampstead is a member and a barrister. The committee is composed of persons with legal training. They can collect the views of all who wish to express a view.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand, having done some quick, behind-the-Chair, consultations, that the Law Reform Committee is a small committee of very eminent lawyers. This is an issue that bears very much on openness generally, involving not merely judges and barristers but solicitors and journalists. There is a lay interest
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0045">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>73</span>
in openness generally, which, in spite of Lord Dip-lock's strictures, I still contend is what the Harman case was about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Solicitor-General's mind utterly and irrevocably made up? Is there no possibility of sending the issue, if it must be sent to a committee, to a committee with a slightly less restricted membership? I know that the Law Reform Committee can take evidence, but when five or six lawyer's heads start thinking in a circle, they think in a particular context which would be changed out of all recognition if lay folk were among them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, between now and Report, the Solicitor-General can, in the light of this discussion, think again in fairness to the House and if only for the sake of appearances. Perhaps the Committee can produce a super report, but I am sure that the Solicitor-General should try to ensure that, when the report appears, justice is not only done but seen to be done. I cannot see how it can be seen to be done by a committee of elderly lawyers alone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far as I know, the Lord Chancellor's mind is by no means irrevocably closed. He has pursued two alternatives and one presents itself to him for an early start.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If some special body comes to mind, or if what is suggested is the forming of an ad hoc body, I suggest that the hon. Gentleman, or any other right hon. or hon. Member who shares that view, should speedily make representations to the Lord Chancellor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been debating a conflict of two principles. I found the Solicitor-General less than usually persuasive today. Very properly, he stated one side of the argument, which had already been attractively argued by the hon. and learned Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Lyell). However he asserted that the debate concerned that side of the argument alone. Such a conflict of principles arises in many debates and, as the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Cunningham) said, not often do all the arguments run one way. If they did, there would be no point in the debate. From time to time we have to try to resolve the conflict between the two principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wholly agreed with most of the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price) but I do not agree with the assertion that someone's views depend upon whether he is a journalist or a lawyer. My hon. Friend may recollect that from time to time lawyers have supported him on the matter. The courts that had successively to rule upon the Harman case were divided. The matter does not depend wholly upon someone's background. At least two lawyers on the Committee, I understand, are on the same side as my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a conflict cannot be resolved by any general philosophical pronouncement. It does not help to ask whether someone is in favour of free speech or of confidentiality. The problem must be resolved each time that it arises, and in the light of all the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>74</span>
circumstances of the case—circumstances described most persuasively by my hon. Friend. Of course, both the use of tape recorders and the precise help that a journalist requires make a difference. If I remember rightly, the author of Ecclesiastes said
	<br><q><p>" To everything there is a season⁢ A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together."</p></q>
C. S. Lewis the hero of my youth, put it even more succinctly, when he made that child of darkness, Uncle Screwtape, declare that the general strategy of the devil is to have everyone running around with fire extinguishers whenever there is a flood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must examine the conflict of the two principles in the context in which it arises. If we can avoid a conflict, so much the better. The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Cunningham) made an attractive suggestion about possible ways of resolving the conflict without actually deciding against one or other principle. I hope that whoever has to consider the matter will keep that suggestion in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that I am on the side of those who think that it would not be appropriate to refer the matter to the Law Reform Committee. We shall all make representations, but I hope that the Lord Chancellor will read the 	<i>Official Report</i> of the Committee. I have every respect for the Law Reform Committee, especially its distinguished chairman and, in many cases, it does a superb job. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West made the valid criticism that the Committee consisted entirely of lawyers. Lawyers are capable of keeping open minds—that should be part of their training—and some lawyers would have much sympathy with arguments for free speech. However, some will say that only the legal point of view and not that of journalists, communicators and the media, has been represented. Whatever emerged it would be subject to criticism. It would not be fair to subject it to such an inquiry. Perhaps a departmental inquiry or a commission—not a Royal commission because that would take too long—could be set up. We can discuss the appropriate course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue has been ventilated and I hope that the Lord Chancellor will find the arguments deployed this morning helpful. I do not think that he would find it much more helpful if the Committee divided upon the matter. There may well be expertise on the Floor of the House that will be able to shed further light on the matter, and I agree that we should debate it on the Floor of the House. In the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Clause be read a second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a somewhat narrower and more technical matter which has been ventilated in another place. It is also a very important matter which will be much debated from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basis of compensation for accident in this country is that if a person causes loss or damage to another, either deliberately or negligently, he is under an obligation to compensate the victim. But in the absence of any fault, the loss lies where it falls and the victim must bear his misfortune with as much fortitude as he can command.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That has been the general rule, but over the past century the law has made inroads into what was originally a laissez-faire position. Now we can insure against accidental damage and injury. We can protect ourselves by getting the strength of the insurance companies around us. In some cases, the community will help us. We have a national insurance scheme which provides benefit for those who are off work sick, however the sickness or disability came about. There are benefits and help for the handicapped, and although they are not sufficient, they are growing in number.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not cling as a matter of principle to the philosophy that those who suffer injury or loss are on their own and should be left to cope unaided. In certain areas we have embraced the principle that those who engage in hazardous occupations or undertakings should be strictly liable to compensate those who are injured in consequence, irrespective of the fault. If they benefit from conducting the undertaking, they should insure the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The occupier of a factory has a statutory obligation to ensure the safety of his employees in certain respects, and visitors to the premises. If he fails and they are injured, he must compensate them, even if they cannot establish that he was negligent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, our proposal is not novel in principle. Those who believe that leaving the victim of an accident to establish, if he can, that someone was at fault, or else to bear his misfortune alone, are adopting an outdated approach. Let us say, for example, that two men each lose an eye. In one
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>76</span>
case it is clearly the fault of someone else. The man has the good fortune to have a witness who is prepared to give evidence. The wrongdoer has assets to satisfy any judgment which may be given. So the man is fully compensated, in so far as money can compensate for the loss of his eye.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other man suffers identical injury. His loss is precisely the same and the consequences for his future the same, but it was no one's fault. It was just one of those things, there was no witness looking in the right direction at the right time, or the wrongdoer has no assets so cannot satisfy any judgment given. That person is left to cope without compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we should consider, not how or why a person came by an injury, but what are his needs. That was the subject of a recent letter in 	<i>The Times</i> by my right hon Friend the Member for Manchester, Wythenshawe (Mr. Morris). It was also the theme of the Pearson report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course there are difficulties about any scheme of this sort. First, one is entitled to ask how it will be financed. There are three possibilities. First, resources might be taken from those who engage in the activity, irrespective of fault. American law has developed the concept that those who make a profit from placing something on the market or from manufacturing or repairing it should compensate, as a matter of strict liability, those who are injured by it. Secondly, we may finance it by sharing out existing resources, by reducing the measure of damages awarded at present. The fear that such a scheme might be contemplated has led many people to have reservations about it. Thirdly, it may be financed from public funds in the same way as the National Health Service. It is certainly possible to argue that the community as a whole should look after those who are injured in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many other questions. Should the scheme extend only to those who suffer accidental injury or do we extend it to those who suffer an occupational disease? Do we extend it to those with congenital handicaps and misfortunes? Wherever one stops, there is a good case for going one stage further. That has frequently been used as an argument for not even taking the first step. Should we require those whose fault led to the injury to recompense the financial source of the scheme? Are those who bring injury on themselves to bear a proportion of the loss, as they do now in the case of contributory negligence? Those matters were ventilated before the Pearson Commission and, I have no doubt, will be ventilated again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Pearson Commission recommended, in effect, a pilot scheme for those who suffer injury through the use of a vehicle on a road. The new clause proposes a much narrower pilot scheme which is intended to deal with what happens when a driver has a sudden heart attack or a vehicle causes an accident by reason of a defect which the owner or driver could not reasonably be expected to foresee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I imagine that all members of the Committee have been approached from time to time by someone who has suffered injury or whose car has been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>77</span>
damaged because a driver collapsed at the wheel, saying " I was in no way to blame for the accident. Am I not to receive any compensation? Am I to be landed with the whole bill? " The insurance company refuses to compensate—quite properly within the existing law, because it has undertaken to insure against liability. If the person concerned is not liable, the insurance company does not have to compensate anybody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause proposes that the driver concerned should be liable to compensate. That means that his insurance company will be liable and, in turn, that there will be some increase in premiums, although I guess that it will be only a marginal increase when it is divided among all the driving public. Since frequently it is the driver of another vehicle which has been damaged who complains, I suspect that drivers would be happy to pay a marginally higher premium in order to have the risk removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will help to persuade the Solicitor-General if I repeat what I pointed out on Second Reading—that the clause has the blessing of the Society of Conservative Lawyers. In 1970, in its document " Your Rights, Your Counts and Your Interests ", it proposed a similar provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say a word about the theoretical basis of the proposals. The amendment was drafted by a distinguished member of the Bar. I should like to mention his name, but since I overlooked getting his permission to do so, perhaps I should not. I thought that it was a masterly attempt at draftsmanship. He used the concept of deeming the driver to be negligent, when he was not negligent. All sorts of objections were quite properly advanced to that, and it would cause unnecessary complications. We are not now proposing that anybody should be deemed to be negligent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there was the suggestion in another place that we were introducing a rebuttable presumption, and that was properly and promptly shot down. Nobody, certainly at this stage, is proposing to introduce a rebuttable presumption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am content simply to say that the measure brings in no-fault liability in a very limited way, to help to remedy a real injustice. In the process, it might provide us with a pilot scheme to give experience for the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Alexander	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newark) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and learned Gentleman has adduced an argument which I find very attractive, although I am not quite certain of my voting duties later on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to do more than skate over the question of costs. As the right hon. and learned Gentleman has had the new clause carefully drafted, does not he think it a good idea to talk to the insurance companies to see the extent to which premiums would increase? Motorists, who must insure their vehicles, regard premiums as too high. It would be interesting to know from the insurance companies whether the right hon. and learned Gentleman is correct that the increases would be neglig-able.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman saw the question in my eyes, but that was going through my mind before he spoke. Perhaps we would have carried out this consultation if there had been more time. We know the difficulties in such a case. Opposition Members have fewer resources than the Government to conduct such consultations. Perhaps the Solicitor-General will offer to undertake some of them on our behalf. But I certainly hope that we shall have had an opportunity to do that before the Report stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not deploy those arguments any further, as they are well enough known. Perhaps the Solicitor-General can assist the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I be clear whether there is a misprint in line 2 of the new clause, which refers to
	<br><q><p>" circumstances specified in subsection (c)".</p></q>
Should that not read " specified in subsection (2)"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Among the mass of papers before me, I have not been able to find the Amendment Paper quickly enough to answer the hon. Gentleman's point. But I am most grateful to him. I am assured by members of the Committee that it is a misprint. I apologise for that, as it was clearly my responsibility to read the Amendment Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole business of liability without fault is fascinating. The more we talk about it, the better. It would be beneficial if we could usefully experiment with it, but I wonder whether the road accident experiment will be useful in extending die principle. There is compulsory insurance against road accidents. If we passed legislation of this nature, there would be an obligation on the owner to have insurance for these risks as well as the risks to which he is exposed at present. This is an easy option. I agree with the right hon. and learned Gentleman that few of the cases would fall within the very narrow definition of subsection (2). Therefore, the effect of insurance would probably be small, although still noticeable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there would still be insurance. If we are to go over to a system of responsibility without fault, we shall enter other spheres where there is not compulsory insurance. The difficulties would be far greater, because the financial costs could not be settled simply by requiring the potentially liable person to insure, and the insurance companies to pay. I am not sure whether this experiment would be useful in elucidating the problems which would arise if the principle were extended further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find the notion in subsection (3) hard to swallow. If I were the owner of a vehicle, and allowed someone else to use it, and that person had a heart attack or the car was struck by a bolt of lightning, I should be liable. That may fit in with the insurance position, but it is getting far away from direct responsibility for individual actions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, if we are to adopt the principle of responsibility without fault, there is another sphere in which I should like to see it adopted first, and where it could, in accordance with principle, be adopted. I shall refer to it only briefly, because it is not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>79</span>
directly relevant to the case before us. I am talking of the responsibility which statutory undertakers have in respect of damage caused in the course of supplying the services which they are obliged to supply—this applies to gas and water undertakers and the like. As a result of past court cases, they are not liable in the absence of neglignce. If water leaks out between going into a pipe and coming out at die other end—which I consider to be negligence, as the whole purpose is to get the water from one end of the pipe to the other without its leaking—that is not held to constitute negligence as was established in a famous case in Manchester. In such an instance, I should have thought that the extension of the principle of liability without negligence could be defended in principle much more than in the case of motor accidents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is right that we should seek for ways of dealing with instances where the present fault-based system leads to harsh results. But that is like being against sin: it is only the first step. When we attempt to achieve that objective, we find that the obstacles are formidable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. and learned Gentleman gave as an example the case of two people who had lost an eye. He says that it offends against common decency that one should get £10,000 and the other nothing and that compensation should be linked to need rather than to what caused the fault. There is much to be said for that. But when society says that, in my book the only corollary to it is to say " And we shall put our hands in our pockets and pay it," and not look around for someone else to paiy it, which is what happens. It happened in the thalidomide case. Everyone agreed that those unfortunate children should receive lots of compensation, but everyone looked to someone else to find the money. I think that it would be noble if society adopted the line of the right hon. and learned Gentleman and said " We will put our hand in our pockets and pay up." But that will not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
State-aided benefits are the best that the State can do to give compensation where there is no compensation by means of a claim at law. The idea of putting those up on the same scale as compensation that is paid at law is not considered to be feasible, although I am sure that everyone would like it to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only alternative is to look around and say " We think that it ought to be done, but we are not prepared to find the money. Who ought to find it? ". But again we ought to consider that the misfortune to which the right hon. and learned Gentleman referred of being run into by someone who had just suffered a heart attack and died is great indeed, and it is very much in my mind	<div class='sub'>f</div> <!-- sub --> as I have a constituent who suffered exactly that misfortune. As he said to me, the reason that he was in this predicament is that he had just stopped having comprehensive motor insurance. He had always had such insurance himself but, for perfectly good reasons, he had reduced it to third party, fire and theft, although he knew that that reduced the amount of his cover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
Who ought to be responsible? Is it the person who takes that risk and can readily insure against it either by having a comprehensive policy or by adding this risk to the policy by agreement? I suspect that the premium for that would not be high. I think that the reason why people do not have it is that it has not occurred to them to have it, or if it has, they say, " The risk is so small"— it is small, although very serious when it arises— " that I did not think of adding it to the premium." That would be one way of dealing with the matter, and it would have the advantage that the person who wanted to benefit from that cover was the one who was arranging it and paying for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one possibility. The other is to say " Even if the driver is ex hypothesi blameless, let's make his insurer pay nevertheless." I am not sure that that has much moral backing. If we were to do it, before doing it or even considering whether it should be done I agree that we should do what others in this short debate have suggested and have the fullest information from insurers about the effect of the clause. I cannot tell the Committee of any consultations about that matter, but there would need to be consultations with the insurance companies and with the motoring associations and other interested bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is tempting to go on from there to point to some of the anomalies which would result from introducing such a measure. I do not think that the right hon. and learned Gentleman is suggesting that we should introduce this precise measure, so I shall not deal with questions of drafting. What is clear is that, when any such proposals are put forward, they please a small number of people and immediately cause an unknown number of others to say " Why do it for him, when I am just outside that line? It is just as unfortunate for me. Why not do it for me, too?" Without bothering too much about pilot schemes which, in the nature of things, can only create anomalies, we have to consider straight in the eye whether to have no fault liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. and learned Gentleman fairly says that the new clause is a suggested experiment. He rightly said that Pearson considered the subject in detail and that die Government, as is well known, had not come to a conclusion on its recommendations. Other parties may also be considering them in detail, because of the very big implications for the funding of the liability, if we go on to that, and because one rather shrinks from doing it piecemeal. If it is right in principle to have no-fault liability, let us go for it, but none of us could do that without the most careful consideration of the consequences and particularly of the danger of creating anomalies. I do not think that anyone has suggested that we should go further than having no-fault liability throughout motoring cases, but, if we do, immediately create anomalies between the motoring interests and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end where I started. I think that it is right for all of us to seek an answer to the discrepancy between the position of a man who loses an eye through somebody's fault and the man who loses an eye
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0049">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>81</span>
through nobody's fault, because their needs are the same. But this is more a vehicle for discussion than a provision which can be added to the Bill. I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentlemen will feel that he can withdraw the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There can always be criticisms of proposals of this kind—for example, that it was not the best chosen pilot scheme. I take the point of the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Cunningham) that if we had chosen one which did not include compulsory insurance, we might have gained a wider experience. The hon. Gentleman suggested one way in which there could be a better pilot scheme. But that criticism can be made of any proposal. The hon. Gentleman also criticised subsection (3), which clearly extends the principle. These are all matters which we can discuss at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General put forward two matters. The first was that if the community wanted to see injustices of this kind rectified, it should be prepared to pay. I take that view; there have been occasions when I have also put it forward. But it is an arguable proposition that those who undertake a particu
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>82</span>
lar activity which may give rise to risks for others should themselves be responsible for insuring those others. Firms which place chemicals on the market should be responsible to those damaged by them. It is not totally unarguable that those who use motor vehicles on roads ought to insure the safety of those who are injured by them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the argument about anomalies, but I have never been totally persuaded that, because we cannot cure all the world's evils, we should not attempt to cure any of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there have to be consultations. As this stage, I do not wish to press the matter to a Division. I hope that some of us may be able to have some of the consultations referred to by the Solicitor-General before the next stage in the ligis-lative process.
