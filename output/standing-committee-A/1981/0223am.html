	<div class='page-header'><h1>Criminal Justice Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That, during the further proceedings on the Criminal Justice Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursday at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.
I wish to explain why the Government believe it right that we should proceed in this way in future. The Bill received an unopposed Second Reading and it is a substantial Bill in length and in importance. Its importance denotes the need for no reasonably avoidable delay in completing its stages. Its length makes it right and proper for the Committee to have a substantial amount of time to scrutinise and, if possible, to improve its important provisions.</p></blockquote>
Members of the Committee have promptly served notice that they intend to take proper advantage of the opportunities which our procedures offer. Apart from amendments, over 50 new clauses have been tabled. I make no complaint about that. Indeed, I welcome that approach and it is my hope that the Bill may profit from some of the amendments and new clauses. In some instances they will attract at least our sympathy and we look forward to debates upon them. There is no monopoly of wisdom on these matters on one side of the Committee or the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(York) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the only good thing that the Minister has said so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the atmosphere in the Committee already matches the sunny yet crisp atmosphere out of doors. We have all benefited greatly already, suffering endemically as we do as Members of Parliament from shortage of time, from the dedicated work of many outside organisations, such as NACRO, and equally from the highly informed analyses of the all-party penal affairs group and the Select Committee on Home Affairs. We have benefited from reports of great substance and value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know of any parliamentary organisation unsupported by staff provided by the House authorities that has established a higher reputation for the quality of its deliberations than the all-party group. I say that sincerely. The hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) may be justly proud of the part that he plays as its chairman. However, these deliberations inflict upon us a penalty. There is a great deal to say but there is too little time to say it if our normal arrangements are to continue unchanged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
I gave notice last Thursday of the motion as an act of courtesy to the Committee. Until then there had been no prolixity or waste of time by any right hon. or hon. Member. I have no complaint to make about the length or the relevance of speeches. The fact that I find personally that a clear point made once is more persuasive than the same point made three times over is a purely personal idiosyncrasy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The harsh fact remains that we must remember that time has to be found for the Bill to return to the Floor of the House on Report and Third Reading. The Bill is of great interest to many hon. Members on both sides of the House and we must allow time for its proper consideration on Report and Third Reading. The Bill has then to be considered in another place and to go through all the processes of that place before it returns to the House of Commons. Some of this process can be accommodated after the Summer recess but we must complete the bulk of our consideration of the Bill in plenty of time. We must aim to complete our consideration of the Bill in Committee by Easter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it transpires that the sittings motion is accepted and we begin to sit in the afternoon, and we make faster progress than the hon. and learned Gentlemen thought likely, will he be prepared to reconsider the afternoon sittings if it seems that we shall finish our consideration of the Bill before Easter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I shall be prepared to do that. I feel it right to introduce this proposal so that we may proceed within the timetable that I have outlined and finish our deliberations in Committee by Easter. Eighteen morning sittings until Easter would have allowed us 45 hours of debate. By Thursday last we had used over one-quarter of that time—12! hours—and we had reached only the end of clause 2. That was why I decided to invite the Committee to grant itself rather more time for its task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the motion is carried, I know that the extra time will not be taken up merely because it is available. I am encouraged by the remarks of the hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon), but we still have a great deal to discuss. By sitting in the afternoons until, for example, seven o'clock, we shall have over 60 further hours of consideration. We shall have to see how we get on and we may see fit to vary our practice, but I hope that the Committee will agree that we now need to sit in the afternoons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Kilroy-Silk 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ormskirk) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I am grateful to the Minister for his kind words about the parliamentary all-party penal affairs group. I hope that the sentiments he has expressed this morning will be translated into action when he considers later amendments that have been proposed by the group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am rather surprised that the Minister should feel it necessary to move a sittings motion at this stage. He has already intimated that there has been no wasting of time or filibustering by the Opposition, and nor will there be. The Bill is an extremely important one. It is the only opportunity that many of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0237">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>183</span>
us will have during the lifetime of this Parliament to debate the issues which arise from the clauses and the amendments, and I think it is important that we have time to debate those issues. In that sense I am grateful to the Minister for tabling his sittings motion as it will ensure that we have time for full and proper consideration of all the issues that have been tabled for discussion. 1 can assure him personally that I shall not take up the extra time that has been made available merely because it is available. However, I shall want to discuss fully the issues which arise in the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You well know, Mr. Dean, the way in which this institution works. It is no secret that the only weapon that the Opposition have is time. It is no secret either that that time becomes less pressing the more reasonable and amenable the Government are to moderate and sensible proposals that are put to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman has so far not been as responsive to what we regard as reasonable and sensible suggestions as he could have been. With the new sense that seems to be pervading the Committee we hope that the Minister will be more amenable in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am only sorry for his hon. Friends because the Minister is putting a fairly heavy burden on those who sit behind him. It is they who have to ensure that the Committee starts. It is they who have to ensure that we have a quorum. It is they who have to be here every time there is a potential vote, whereas I and my hon. Friends can come and go as we please. It is rather unfair and unreasonable for the Minister to impose this burden upon his hon. Friends at an early stage of the proceedings and I am sorry for them. I am pleased that we have the opportunity to debate the issues in a more relaxed, fuller but not time-wasting fashion. Therefore, I shall not oppose the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Shirley Summerskill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister replies to this extensive debate I hope that he will say whether he wants the Committee to sit until seven o'clock, eight o'clock or nine o'clock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said seven o'clock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. I hope that the extra time will enable us to have the benefit of more speeches from Conservative Members on the Back Benches. We have the benefit of speeches from the hon. and learned Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve), which I always feel reinforce the Opposition's arguments. I was most impressed by the contribution last night by the hon. Member for Padding-ton (Mr. Wheeler) on "Panorama". He was far more impressive than any of the representatives of the judiciary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Sims 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chislehurst) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Paddington (Mr. Wheeler) is not a member of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman put in an appearance a minute ago. With all his qualifications and background, I feel that he should be giving
	<span class='label label-info column'>184</span>
us the benefit of his experience as an assistant prison governor and in the research department of the Home Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister shakes his head. Am I wrong? The hon. Member for Paddington was here a moment ago. This shows that Conservative Members are speaking so little that they do not really register on the mind, except for the hon. and learned Member for Solihull who we are always pleased to see and hear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we have had plenty of sympathy from the Minister, we hope that we shall receive some more substantial evidence of his support. He said complimentary things about NACRO and about the all-party penal affairs group. Perhaps he will extend those compliments and do something more substantial by accepting their views and ideas, which he clearly holds in high esteem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of our proceedings is to examine the Bill line by line. Although we gave it an unopposed Second Reading, we said on Second Reading that we were far from happy about a great deal of its content and that we would wish to amend it in Committee. This is the type of Bill that could benefit from detailed Committee stage improvement. We have had five sittings and we have not really extracted one positive improvement from the Minister but, we are persuaded by his assurances that in future he may be able to see things slightly differently. We hope that, as a result of a possible 24 sittings to come, the Bill will be greatly improved when it leaves the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dulwich) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall detain the Committee for only a moment. I welcome what the Minister has said about future intentions. I hope that they will be rapidly brought into effect, because I shall be moving the next two amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate what the Minister said, but would it not be adequate at this stage to have an extra afternoon sitting only on Tuesdays? I should be happy if such a sitting were extended to a later hour than the Minister indicated in order to avoid the sitting on Thursday. The reason is fairly obvious. We certainly do not want to deprive the 1922 Committee of the valuable contributions on penal reform which Conservative members of the Committee might wish to make. Similar difficulties arise for Opposition members of the Committee, though not in respect of the 1922 Committee. Thursday evening is a difficult time. Will the Minister consider that and respond to it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful for the constructive way in which the Committee has responded to the motion. I am particularly grateful to the hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill), who is leading for the Opposition. I am glad that the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) has seen the advantages that I endeavoured to describe and will not oppose the motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady said that my hon. Friend the Member for Paddington (Mr. Wheeler) should be a member of the Committee. My party is full of potential
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0238">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>185</span>
ornaments to the Committee, but it is confined to 12 members. If my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary had been permitted rather more than 25 seconds on last nights programme and had been able to compete on equal terms with my hon. Friend the Member for Paddington, the hon. Lady might have found it in her heart to have said things equally complimentary about my right hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I meant what I said when I expressed the hope that at later stages of our proceedings the Bill may profit from the amendments and new clauses that have been tabled. It will not be a question of my seeing things slightly differently but of my seeing slightly different things. I intend to be as helpful, with the support of my hon. Friends, as I can. We all want to see this an even better Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hear, of course, what the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) says about the convenience of the Committee. The best thing that I can say in response is that these matters can most usefully be discussed through the usual channels, and if it is possible to agree on a course that will be amenable to the Committee as a whole, I shall be glad to propose it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That, during the further proceedings on the Criminal Justice Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 3</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>CONSECUTIVE TERMS AND AGGREGATE PERIODS OF DETENTION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 16, in clause 3, page 4, line 13, leave out from " direction " to " so " in line 14.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 17, in page 4, line 16, leave out subsection (4).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The provisions of clause 3 to which I am directing attention are, for me at any rate, somewhat unusual. They deal with what is to happen when a court makes a detention centre order which, if it were given effect, would involve the person concerned remaining in a detention centre for one period longer than four months. Subsection (2) provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>" No court shall give a direction under subsection (1)... whose effect would be that the offender would be ordered to be detained in a detention centre for more than 4 months at a time."</p></blockquote>
Normally, if my recollection of the provisions of the criminal law is accurate, it would be sufficient to stop there, and anything over four months would be unlawful and would not be served. However, for reasons about which I am not clear, the clause goes further and splits off in two directions. In subsection (3) it provides for those offenders who are aged less than 15 years and sets out what would be the normal rule. If a court does that which it is prohibited from doing by subsection (2), the excess over four months
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
which would be affected by the prohibition is to be "treated as remitted". I am not altogether happy about the use of the word "remitted" because that can be used in more than one sense, but I take it that it should be treated as if a sentence of four months only had been passed, so that any remission earned by the offender during the four months would be received by him. If it does not mean that, there is a serious fault in the subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, if the effect of consecutive sentences, which will amount to eight months at a detention centre, is that four months will be remitted to cover the normal one-third remission, that will be a grave defect. I am sure that that is not intended, but the Minister may wish to give his mind to the word "remitted" in that context. However, that is not the purpose of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we come to the other branch of the provisions, we turn to offenders aged 15 years or more. We have what seems to be the unusual and peculiar position that, in the case of those aged 15 and over, if the court has made a direction which is prohibited by subsection (2), the effect of which will be that the offender will be detained for more than four months at one time, it will have partial effect for those over 15 by virtue of subsection (4). In those circumstances the youth custody order will operate for the full period, including the period absolutely prohibited by subsection (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems an extraordinary provision. I do not know whether it is unique but I have not been able to find any other such provision. The Minister will be able to tell us whether a similar provision exists elsewhere. The rationale behind it is extremely difficult to follow. We are telling a court not to do something and we expect it to obey the law. We then say that if it does not obey the law some effect will be given to its sentence and that will have the effect of depriving a person of liberty for a period which, because it will be translated into youth custody rather than attending a detention centre, will become a lawful sentence. If the courts do something unlawful, the operation of the Act will make it lawful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That appears to be almost an incentive for courts in such circumstances not deliberately to pass longer detention centre orders than subsection (2) permits but to pass youth custody sentences for the periods that they wish. These provisions would certainly give a licence to courts to be slapdash in their methods for reasons that I cannot understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation that is being envisaged is one in which the sentencing court break the law by making an order for more than four months at detention centre ab initio, which it should know it cannot do. It should surely be perfectly clear to the court that four months is the maximum. Alternatively, the court can produce the same result by the addition of a new sentence to one which is already being served, or is about to be served. In either instance there could not possibly be any excuse for a court not knowing what had happened hitherto. If the young person is sent to a detention centre, the court will be told that he is serving such a sentence. If such
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0239">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>187</span>
a sentence has been passed by another court, or by the same court in an immediately preceding case, the court will know. It should be the duty of the court authorities to ascertain the current situation before sentence is passed. There can be no excuse for not doing so. The Bill provides that if the court, in defiance of the provisions of subsection (2), and acting in what seems to be a slapdash, careless way, passes a sentence that it is prohibited from imposing, the offender is nonetheless required to serve the sentence within youth custody rather than in a detention centre if he is over 15.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At an earlier stage of our discussions the Minister explained to us the importance that he attributes to the difference of regimes, and that lends force to what I am saying. The Minister will recall that I asked him which he regarded as the heavier sentence, youth custody or detention centre. He said that he regarded them not in that way but on the basis of different regimes which are appropriate to different offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is so, surely the provisions of subsection (4), in addition to the defect that I have described of penalising a person because of an unlawful order, have the additional defect that the offender will serve a sentence in a regime different from the one that the court intended, the court having presumably considered whether it was appropriate to send him on to a detention centre. Having decided that he should be sent to a detention centre, the court will find that because a mistake has been made he will serve a youth custody order instead, which may not be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems on many grounds that the provisions of the clause as they stand are open to serious objection. The purpose of my two amendments is to bring the law back to what I believe it to be in the ordinary way. If the court makes an unlawful direction under clause 2 by ordering that the offender shall go to a detention centre for more than four months either by virtue of consecutive sentences or otherwise, the offender, whether he is over or under 15, should be treated as if that sentence had not been ordered and the maximum of four months should apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that the amendment touches upon a very important basic principle of penal reform. However, it bears on the important principle that an offender should not be penalised because of the unlawful act of a court of law. Surely that is an important principle which should be followed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be for the convenience of the Committee if I briefly rehearse the effects of clause 2(3), to which the amendment applies. The subsection guards against the imposition of a custodial sentence of more than four months on a 14-year old offender because the maximum custodial sentence for 14-year olds is set at four months. A court can order that two or more detention centre orders should run consecutively, but it should not do so if the effect is that the offender is ordered to
	<span class='label label-info column'>188</span>
be detained in a detention centre for more than four months at a time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) provides that if a court does give such a direction in respect of an offender aged less than 15 years, so much of the term as exceeds four months shall be treated as remitted. The provision is automatic and it means that the excess over four months has no effect at all in the case of a 14-year-old offender for whom the maximum sentence is, as I have said, four months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the amendment of the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) to extend that provision to all offenders aged under 21, so that where a court mistakenly passes two or more detention centre orders which result in a term which is longer than four months, the excess over four months is treated as remitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pick up at the outset the point that he made about the use of the word " remission", which I entirely understand. I am grateful to him for that, as well as for the other points that he has made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The use of the word "remission" is not susceptible to any ambiguity or confusion. It certainly does not mean what it means in its normal connotation of remission for good conduct, which is that if one loses one's good conduct one may serve the full nominal amount of the sentence in custody. It is used in the subsection because the offender would be released after four months with the remainder treated as if it had no effect at all. That is the distinction between remission used in this sense and remission used in the normal good conduct sense under the prison rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the same as the position of a prisoner who is released after two-thirds has been served under normal remission arrangements, but subject to there being no parallel provision that if the condition for remission, good conduct, is not fulfilled, the full nominal amount of the sentence is served. The point, which I think is plain from the wording of subsection (3), is that for all purposes that part of the sentence that is surplus to four months shall be of no effect at all. The use of the word " remit", therefore, is appropriate and we need have no fears on that score. I shall look at it again in the light of what the right hon. Gentleman has said, but I do not anticipate the need to make any change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions in subsections (3) and (4) are there because the calculation of consecutive and aggregate sentences is notoriously difficult, particularly when an offender is already serving one sentence and the next is imposed. The general intention of the provision is that any sentence of four months or less should take effect as a detention centre order and that any sentence of over four months should be a youth custody sentence. A court is given power to pass consecutive terms of detention under clause 3(1) and I think we all agree that a court should have that power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) comes into play to provide that courts that pass consecutive terms of detention do not impose a term of longer than four months in a detention centre. I agree that there are three ways of approaching this. Having set out our intention
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0240">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>189</span>
in this early part of the Bill that detention centres should carry a miximum of four months, we could adopt the first solution to the problem that would arise if a court sentenced somebody to more than four months. We could let the law take its course. We could adopt the cumbersome and lengthy processes of appeal and simply let the Court of Appeal sort it out, or the Crown Court in the case of a magistrates' order. No doubt that would be logical, but it is not very practical when one is dealing with short sentences. I do not believe that that would be right, even though the courts would no doubt do their best to expedite the hearing of the appeal. It is proper and wise for Parliament to face this possibility at the outset and to say in the legislation that if the court makes a mistake we wish certain consequences to follow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will recognise that my amendment accepts the point that he has just made. It does make provision, but it makes the same provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I recognise that. We come to the second alternative. It will be possible for us to do what the right hon. Gentleman says. He says, " Very well, in the case of a 14-year-old where this mistake is made you are saying that everything that is in excess of four months will be eliminated and all that will happen is that the youngster serves four months ". The reason we do that in that case is that we provide in the Bill that no 14-year-old may serve for longer than four months and that he may not serve in any institution other than a detention centre. Those restrictions do not apply once the young offender becomes 15. The reason why we believe it to be right to take a separate course for 15-year-olds and above is right that we believe that the courts should have power to pass consecutive sentences. They will do so only when they believe that it is proper to add to the duration served under a first sentence. They have a choice of making sentences consecutive or concurrent. When they take a positive decision to make a consecutive sentence they are positively deciding that the sentence being served will be insufficient to meet the justice of the case. Alternatively, they are positively deciding that a sentence that is appropriate for count one on an indictment will be insufficient in duration to take account of the justice of the case demanded by counts two or three. Having done that, therefore, they have positively decided that the duration that is expressed in their consecutive sentences is the appropriate duration to meet the justice of the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to override that, we should be going against what the courts have decided in terms of the duration of custody. The purpose of the Bill is to restore to courts the power to decide how long a young offender shall remain in custody. The borstal sentence at the moment does not give them that power. It is common ground on both sides of the Committee that the courts should have the power to decide how long a young offender stays in custody. We should be going against that if we were to follow the course of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>190</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find that rather difficult to follow. I am sure that the Minister will enlighten me. By virtue of subsections (5) and (6), in circumstances of that kind the court is given the express power to sentence to youth custody for a period in excess of four months and an existing detention centre order is then assimilated into the longer youth custody sentence. It has that power. I am querying why in addition to that it is thought necessary to put in a provision which treats as being lawful something which is prohibited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and learned Gentleman is right. It has that power. We are dealing with when the court makes a mistake. One has to decide whether the court's choice of quality of custody is to take preference over the court's choice of duration of custody. That is the issue. The court will have imposed a detention centre for a total of so many months. Parliament has to decide where the priority shall lie. For the reasons that I have given, we believe it is right to give priority to the duration rather than to the quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it be thought rather fanciful that this kind of mistake can happen, save, in a wholly exceptional case I must say that the whole question of aggregates and consecutive sentences is very complicated. If I were to give a factual scenario, I should do it in these terms. Let us assume that X is charged with burglary. He is remanded in custody and spends four weeks in custody before appearing in court in Winchester and being given, a three-month detention centre order. A week later he is produced before a court in London charged with another burglary, for which he is also given a three-month detention centre order. The court makes no order that that detention centre order should be consecutive upon the first, so it begins to run on the date on which it was imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A month later, X appears before the court in Guildford with two co-defendants who are jointly charged with handling stolen goods. One co-defendant is just over 21 and he is given a two-month prison sentence. X and a third defendant are given two-month detention centre orders. There is no doubt that the Guildford court thinks that two months is the right sentence for X for that offence. The court knows that X is serving two three-month detention centre orders and that he was in custody on remand for a month. It therefore expresses the sentence as a detention centre order to run consecutively upon his current order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fact, X's sentence will be treated as a youth custody sentence. I shall explain why. He was originally remanded in custody in connection with the burglary for which he was dealt with at Winchester. That time serves to reduce only the sentence imposed at Winchester. The three-month order that he was given in London a week later began to run on the date that it was made. The Guildford sentence begins to run when the London sentence runs. The result is that X is ordered to be detained in a detention centre for five months and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0241">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>191</span>
one week at a time. His sentence is therefore treated as a youth custody sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may seem exaggerated but I assure the Committee that such situations can often arise as a consequence of introducing determinate sentences for young offenders. Provision must be made to meet the problems which are known to arise with determinate sentences. Although I follow the right hon. and learned Gentleman's argument, given that it is right to make provision expressly in the statute for the consequences of a mistake that can arise, I think it right that we should give priority to the duration rather than to the quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In parenthesis, I note with a certain irony that Labour Members, who are very much opposed to detention centres and all that they do, should in the amendment seek to perpetuate a detention centre order which would conflict with the policy of the Bill. Unfortunately I cannot advise the Committee to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to say a few words about the irony to which the Minister referred. The point is totally misconceived. The effect of the amendment would be to retain the limit of four months in a detention centre, which is in the Bill. If the amendment had the result that anyone would serve for more than four months in a detention centre, I could see the justification for that observation. If, for example, subsection (6) made an exception to the total of four months to be served in a detention centre, it would be justified. As the Minister put it, it deals with the duration rather than the quality of the sentence. What the Minister has said in effect is that there are cases in which it would be difficult for a court to work out—because of the effect of remand and other matters—precisely how much is left for an offender to serve within the four months limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is equally a problem with a 14-year-old as with a person over 15. If it arises in either case, it does not seem to be a justification for saying that in the case of a person over 15 the prohibition provided by subsection (2) could be got over by the device contained in subsection (4). It is needless to repeat the points which I made which the Minister did not seem to deal with in substance, in particular the difference in character of the two sentences, and the different consideration which the court would apply when deciding between one or the other, apart from the question of duration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am somewhat disappointed in the reply, particularly after the remarks that the Minister made in his observations in support of his sittings motion. I hoped that at least we might have obtained from the Minister a promise to look at this matter again, without any commitment. I regret that that has not been given, but we may wish to come back to the issue on another occasion if no amendment is tabled by the Government at a later stage of the Bill to meet the point which I have made. However I do not wish to detain the Committee longer than is neces-

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This series of amendments attempt to repeal section 53 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. I had hoped that the Minister would say that he would accept that, since it follows the logic of his own Bill. However, since I have had no such sign, may I be allowed, even in these strained times, to explain why I take that view?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 53(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act permits a court to sentence a person under the age of 18 to be detained at Her Majesty's pleasure for a limit of life, and refers specifically to the former capital offences, including murder. It is a curious provision, in that it refers to the break-off age of 18, and not the the break-off age for children and young persons, which is normally 17. The provision has been used, however, since 1933 in all cases of murder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A total of 194 young persons have been detained in such a way in that period. Section 53(2) refers to the cases of children and young persons, that is, children under 17 years of age, who are sentenced for offences which would carry a maximum term of imprisonment of 14 years or more for an adult, and are therefore the more serious offences which do not carry an imprisonment for life. A total of 414 of such cases have been sentenced since 1933. The significant factor is that, of that 414, 355 have been sentenced since 1972, and of the 355, 266 have been sentenced since 1976. In other words, the courts have been using the provisions of section 53(2) to a much larger extent than ever in the last four or five years. Indeed, they are using this provision to send children to prison for repeated offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had an argument, which I do not want to repeat, about the tariff for offending, and whether there ought to be an increasing period of imprisonment because someone has previously been in prison for a similar offence. My view is that this serves no useful purpose and that it is simply an indication of an outworn tariff system. To use it in the case of people under the age of 17, even though one recognises that some of those young people are now committing quite grave offences, seems to call into question the need for a power such at that in section 53(2). That argument would stand on its own even
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0242">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>193</span>
if we were not introducing some entirely new form of punishment for such people, but we are doing that. I cannot understand why we need to keep section 53 at all, given the fact that we are now introducing a system of youth custody akin to imprisonment for people under the age of 17. The power in the Bill can be used to house them in any kind of penal establishment throughout the whole period of youth custody which they have to serve. Clause 6, which we shall be discussing shortly, indicates that youth custody can be used for a period of life imprisonment. Clause 6(1) actually says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a person under the age of 21 is convicted of murder or any other offence the sentence for which is fixed by law as imprisonment for life, the court shall sentence him to custody for life"—</p></blockquote>
that is, youth custody for life—
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless he is liable to be detained under section 53(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 ".</p></blockquote>
Why do we need that provision in the Bill at all if this provision in clause 6 can be used to sentence anybody under 17 to youth custody for life? According to the provisions in clause 9, at the age of 21 such people could be transferred to an adult prison. Indeed, I suppose they could be transferred to an adult prison before they reached the age of 21.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, there is nothing to be gained from retaining section 53. Under that section the institution where the person is held is under the discretion of the Home Secretary. He can at present be held in a community home, in a borstal, in a detention centre if need be, or in an adult prison. It is entirely a matter for the Secretary of State under section 53 where a person is kept for the whole period that he is to be kept in life imprisonment, or for a long period of imprisonment, and that can be done under the provisions of the Bill, why do we need to retain section 53?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask this because I do not understand the nature of the dilemma that has caused us to keep section 53 in. I have had the advantage of reading the notes provided by the Department for the use of the Minister, which try to argue that there would be some difficulty in extending the death penalty if we got rid of section 53 and allowed the Act to apply in these more severe cases. If that is so, all we need to do is to put in a provision which indicates that there wil be no change in relation to the death penalty, which presumably would only apply in those cases whiich are not murder, since murder is already dealt with. Since none of the cases that we have had since 1933 dealt with mandatory life sentence for something which was not murder, I cannot see that it is really a very relevant consideration. It would be perfectly easy, I would have thought, simply to have drafted such an amendment and to put it in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that the Department, and indeed the Minister, is frightened that if anything is put in about the death penalty, by the time we reach Report stage there will be some funny business from his own Back Benches. I can understand that because some of them do have a funny bent on this, but I cannot believe that that is a practical reason for introducing this anomaly of keeping what is, in
	<span class='label label-info column'>194</span>
effect, the same kind of sentence under youth custody and keeping section 53. As a result of such an anomaly, I suspect that the higher courts would go on using section 53 to an increasing extent even though they would now have the power of youth custody for considerable periods of time. I suspect they will use it as if this was a special provision that was allowed to High Court judges to deal with repeated offences by children under the age of 17. If that were the case, it would completely undermine what we are trying to do for the higher courts. I have indicated that I do not necessarily agree with what we are trying to do in the Bill, but I can understand what the Government feel. It is giving a possibility to all courts to sentence any offender from 15 upwards for any period of time that would be equivalent to imprisonment in a penal establishment. If we do that, we do not need section 53 at all and if we leave section 53, I am absolutely certain that the High Court judges will think that this is a power reserved to them to give an exemplary sentence simply for repeated offences of a serious nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that was in the mind of the Minister when he was devising the Bill. If we simply restrict the powers of all courts to give a sentence of youth custody for repeated, albeit serious, offences, they will try to have a tariff which will be equitable across the whole range. If repeated burglary, for instance, or repeated robberies are dealt with by Crown courts, or dealt with in appropriate cases by the magistrates' courts on a tariff which suggests that, say, three years youth custody is an appropriate sentence, the higher courts, the High Court judges, will not make the difference between that three years and their own powers any greater. Therefore, they will give about three years in the same sort of case; whereas, if we leave section 53, the High Court judge might say that a particular case is much more serious than a case which would be dealt with under the provisions of youth custody and, therefore, a more appropriate sentence should be given. That would either be sentence for life under section 53 or a period that has been determined, which would be higher than the three-year tariff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is my fear, and it is based upon some reality. I remember a case in which I was involved before I became a Minister where two youths had climbed into an old lady's flat, raped her at knife-point and stole some goods from her. It was both rape and robbery and they were sentenced to life detention under section 53. Under the provisions of this Bill they could be sentenced to youth custody for whatever was the appropriate sentence, and I do not think that the appropriate sentence in that case would have been life. I think that the appropriate sentence in a case of a rape of an old woman by children of that kind would have been something like five to seven years under the existing tariff for an adult offender. Certainly, the stealing would not have been anything like life. In that situation, therefore, for youth custody, to be similar to an adult case, the judge would have said five to seven years on the tariff, but in terms of section 53, the High
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0243">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>195</span>
Court judge thought he had to pass a sentence which was really leaving it to the Home Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that case I appealed. When we went before the Lord Chief Justice he said that maybe it was true as it was, that a sentence of life under section 53 normally works out at about eight years in custody—that is the tariff that the Home Office applied—but if that was true, it was a matter entirely for the discretion of the Home Secretary. He need not keep him in for eight years and he was not going to say what he thought was the appropriate sentence because it was a matter entirely for the Home Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not what we intend by this Bill. In the Bill we are saying that in youth custody the courts will try to decide the appropriate sentence and pass it for youth custody, not for adult imprisonment. If that is the position, why do we want section 53 at all?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not really pressing the Minister to reply immediately, but in those circumstances I am anxious that he should consider it with his advisers again and decide whether it would not be appropriate to get rid of section 53 altogether. The figures I have indicated for section 53(2) sentences in the last five years are quite horrifying and we ought to do something to stop that tendency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Section 53 of the 1933 Children and Young Persons Act provides that a child under the age of 18 who has been convicted of murder can be detained under Her Majesty's pleasure. It also provides that a juvenile who has been convicted on indictment for an offence for which an adult could be sentenced for a period of 14 years in prison—for example, manslaughter, robbery or burglary—can also be detained in such a place and under such conditions as the Secretary of State may determine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend, it would seem to me that the section in the 1933 Act is made redundant by the provisions of the Bill, but also like my hon. Friend, I do not, for some reason, anticipate that the Minister will accept the argument that has been put this morning. There are, therefore, two or three things that ought to be raised with him, the kind of things that concern some of us about the operation of section 53 of the 1933 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First of all, there has been a startling increase in the number of young persons sentenced under section 53. In 1979, 80 young offenders were sentenced—a 60 per cent, increase on the figure for 1973 when 50 young offenders were sentenced under section 53. That, in itself, is a 600 per cent, increase on the 12 that were sentenced under section 53 of the 1933 Children and Young Persons Act in 1971. I hope that the Minister will be able to shed light on these figures, either now or perhaps subsequently in a letter, but I want some indication of the reasons for this alarming increase in the number of young offenders sentenced under this particular section. I am especially concerned about the 600 per cent increase in 1971 of the exceptionally serious offences that this section is designed to cover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
Does it mean—it is important for us all to know in considering this Bill and this section—that the number of young offenders committing highly serious offences of an exceptional nature for which section 53 is designed has increased, or does it perhaps mean, as my hon. Friend suggested or speculated, that the number of serious offences committed by young people has not increased but the propensity of the courts to use this section for less serious offences has? We need to know which it is, and I think the Minister would want to know the reasons for what can only be described as an alarming increase in the number of young offenders sentenced under this section.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second cause for concern alluded to by my hon. Friend is the accommodation in which these young people are housed. Under section 53 they can, as we know, be placed in penal establishments. On 31 October 24 young people sentenced under this section were accommodated in community homes, 11 were accommodated in youth treatment centres and 27 detained in penal establishments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the annual general meeting of the Magistrates' Association in 1979, a resolution was adopted expressing concern at the lack of suitable facilities for accommodating young persons detained under section 53 and urging the Government to take urgent steps to remedy the situation. The Prison Officers' Association has also expressed concern in its comments on the report of the Advisory Council on the Penal System about the practice of accommodating young people in young offender establishments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, the all-party penal affairs group in its in its report " Young Offenders—A Strategy for the Future " recommended in paragraph 306 that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the Government should take urgent steps to ensure that all juveniles detained under section 53 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are accommodated in establishments suited to the needs of disturbed juveniles, rather than in prison department establishments."</p></blockquote>
Those two concerns that I have expressed about the increase in the number of young people sentenced under this section, and the type of accommodation in which they are currently being contained, do not necessarily add up to a case for a repeal of the section. That case has, however, been deployed by my hon. Friend. However, they do constitute an important cause for concern about the operation of the section which therefore requires the urgent attention of the Government, and I hope for some helpful explanation from the Minister when he replies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a particularly interesting debate and it gives rise to one or two technical problems of some difficulty. We are dealing with an amendment that would remove from the statute book an option for the courts that has been there since 1933. The general approach to the sentencing of juveniles which is reflected in the Bill is that no custodial sentence can be imposed on offenders aged under 14. At 14 they become eligible for a detention centre order of four months or less, and offenders aged 15 and 16 can be sentenced to youth custody for a maximum of 12 months—an important point to which I shall return. These are the limits which the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0244">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>197</span>
system places on the sentences available as a concession—if that is the right word—to the offender's youth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These general provisions, however, are wholly inadequate when it comes to dealing with the handful of exceptional children who are convicted of murder and other most serious offences such as manslaughter, attempted murder, rape and robbery with violence and who do not fall to be dealt with under the provisions of the Mental Health Act for one reason or another. We all recognise that this small handful of exceptionally dangerous young people exists. My point at the outset is that the structure for dealing custodially with young offenders set out in this part of the Bill does not provide a sufficient protection for the public against this small handful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, therefore, essential to have a separate provision to deal with such serious offenders. The hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon), to whom I am grateful for the careful and helpful way in which he moved the amendment, said, in effect, that we were creating in clause 6 a sentence of youth custody which was new and that we did not need to keep section 53 any longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both he and his hon. Friend the Member for Orms-kirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) suggested that the courts saw section 53 as a means of imposing life sentences. They said that there has been increasing use of section 53, which is true, and that it would be much better to get rid of it as unnecessary. That seems a fair summary of the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 53 deals separately with murder and other grave crimes. The penalty for murder is fixed by law. For adults it is life imprisonment, for young adults it will, under clause 6, be custody for life. For juveniles it is detention, under section 53(1), during Her Majestys pleasure. All juveniles, up to the age of 17, serving sentences under section 53(1) are placed at the discretion of the Secretary of State in prisons, borstals, youth treatment centres or community homes. If the amendment succeeded, and section 53 were repealed, all juvenile murderers would have to be sentenced under clause 6(1) to custody for life. Under clause 10 they would have to be held, in those circumstances, in a prison or a youth custody centre. That would be manifestly inappropriate for the very young age-group. There are, hideous though it is to contemplate, children as young as 11 who, in relatively recent times, have committed a murder. It would be manifestly inappropriate for somebody of that age to be confined in a prison or a youth custody centre. At present, either secure local authority accommodation or a youth treatment centre managed by the DHSS is the most appropriate accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The grave crimes covered by section 53(2) are those which are punishable in the case of an adult with imprisonment for 14 years or more. A court may order detention under section 53(2) for a determinate period or for life. The hon. Member for York, in moving the amendment, expressed the view that section 53 was now superfluous. I consider
	<span class='label label-info column'>198</span>
that he was mistaken. He argues that section 53 is unnecessary because clause 6 allows for life sentences on young offenders. That is not, however, the case. Section 53 makes provision for juveniles, that is to say, offenders under 17. In section 53(1) in relation to murder, as I have indicated, the higher age group is 18, not 17, but it does not embrace those from 21 down to 18. Clause 5(7) limits youth custody sentences on juveniles to 12 months. The effect of repealing section 53(2) of the Children and Young Persons Act, therefore, would be to confine the sentences for grave offences on those under 17 to 12 months as a maximum, unless it were for murder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that there would, therefore, be a serious lacuna that would apply—admittedly only in a handful of cases, but nonetheless important ones—if section 53 of the Children and Young Persons Act were to go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ormskirk drew attention to the increase in the use made by the courts of section 53, and it was entirely proper that he should do so. I recognise that there has been a substantial increase in its use, and I accept the figures that he gave. I shall certainly take up his invitation to write to him about it. We have been giving a fair amount of thought to the reason for this increase. No very clear conclusions have emerged, but I can say that the sentence is comparatively rarely used for burglary. One of the reasons for sentencing a juvenile under section 53(2) may be to ensure some parity of sentencing when a grave crime has been committed with adult co-defendants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another possible reason is that hospital orders are comparatively rarely used for juveniles, possible because of the difficulty of diagnosing a mental illness or abnormality in very young people. Examination of the individual cases involved showed that the sentence is used very carefully and is regarded by the judges as wholly exceptional. Therefore, I do not think that it is right to suppose that it is used by the judges as a means of, as it were, laying about them with a sentence of exceptional severity. That is not disclosed by the work that has been done in examining these cases.

Juveniles serving sentences under section 53(2) are placed at the discretion of the Secretary of State in prisons, borstals, detention centres, youth treatment centres or community homes. As I have indicated, youth treatment centres are run by the DHSS.

If I may be permitted a personal note, I visited St. Charles centre at Brentwood long before I had any responsibility for these affairs and was greatly impressed by the care and individual attention to these exceptionally difficult cases that was exercised there. The same can be said of the Royal Philanthropic Society's home near Reigate which I have also visited.

Although I look forward to being able to accept an amendment to be moved shortly by the hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon), I am afraid that, for the reason that I have given, a dangerous lacuna would be left here. I shall certainly investigate the statistics further and shall write to the hon. Member for Ormskirk, but, for the reasons I have given,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0245">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>199</span>
I am not able to advise the Committee to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister took that view. I recognise that he has a strong point in relation to children under the age of 15 who may commit a very serious offence which would merit a period of custody of more than 12 months. Were my amendment to be carried, I recognise that he would need to provide for such a situation. I do not think that that is impossible in the terms of the Bill to do so. It would be perfectly easy to extend the capacity of the court in cases where the maximum term of imprisonment for an adult was 14 years or more to allow them in such cases on certain conditions to extend youth custody for longer than 12 months. That would deal with the matter in what seems to me a much more rational way than the one that the Minister proposes, which still leaves considerable ambiguity between what one means by a sentence under section 53 for a young person between the ages of 15 and 17. That seems to me to pose considerable dangers, given the kind of increase in sentencing under section 53(2) which has taken place in the last five years. The Minister did not really address himself to that, and I think that he has not thought that part of it out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not propose to press the amendment because I recognise that, were it to be carried, it would need consequential amendments and other factors would have to be taken into consideration. I would ask him to think about it before Report and to look at the whole matter in a new light. What would happen if one wanted to get rid of section 53? What would be the necessary consequential amendments to the other part of the Bill? What would give more rational sentencing policy over the whole range of children from the age of 11 up to the age of 21?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a strong case to be considered. I suspect that what has happened is that, because section 53 existed, the Department simply thought that we might as well let it go, particularly if it involved some difficulty about the capital sentence for treason and other non-murder offences. I suspect that, by comparison, that is a minnow of a problem compared with the problem that will arise if we go on with this system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked about the examination that has already been done into why sentences are passed. He might also care to read the paragraph in Arch-bold, which goes through a number of cases in which sentences of this kind have been passed. For instance, in Bosomworth a sentence of 30 months for affray was passed on a boy of 15 who had only one previous conviction—for burglary. It cannot be said that that would have been an inappropriate case for pasing a sentence of youth custody. If the court feels that 12 months is too short a sentence, there may be provision, as I have indicated, for the higher courts to give rather more than 12 months in such cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>200</span>
Many other cases quoted in that pasage indicate that the higher courts—the appeal courts—have been sanctioning section 53(2) sentences in cases that have nothing to do with the serious cases of murder, rape, or robbery of an extreme nature. They are dealing with people between 15 and 17 in this way when, given that they are to have the power of youth custody, they would be more appropriately dealt with under youth custody. I accept that if they approach the position rationally, the higher courts can say that now that they have the power of youth custody, they do not need to use section 53. They may use it less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What concerns me is that the very fact of leaving in section 53(2) will induce them to regard it as a more severe form of punishment than ought to be used in cases where youth supervision would have been appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not quite the whole point of what I was proposing to say. What is left out of the hon. Gentleman's argument is that the consequence of his amendment would oblige juveniles to serve their sentences in youth custody centres. I do not know if he intends to deal with the example that I gave of the 11-year-old.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 53(2) gives this flexibility to detain an offender during Her Majesty's pleasure at places such as the St. Charles centre, which are very different, as the hon. Gentleman will know, from youth custody centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the seriousness of his argument, and I shall think about it, though without commitment, because there is a strong case for retaining section 53, including subsection (2). Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would care to deal with the point about additional flexibility for the very young.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is a real difficulty—though I suspect that it is not—it can be dealt with by a consequential amendment to the later section which governs the capacity of the Home Secretary to put people into whatever appropriate penal establishment that he feels desirable. It would be perfectly possible for the Home Secretary—for instance in the case of murder by a child under 15—to say that he should serve his sentence in an establishment which would not be available to him under the youth custody provisions. That is not really a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the real reason for retaining this is simply the immutability of section 53, which has been there since 1933, on the principle that he adopted on the last occasion about Conservative reaction to what had been tried in the past, and also the problem of the death sentence for offences which are not murders. I suspect that both these problems could easily be dealt with in consequential amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned to have something which is not merely more rational—we all know that legislation is not always rational—but which will not lead to a situation in which people under 18 will have much longer periods of detention than are required under
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0246">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>201</span>
youth custody. That is what I should like the Minister to look at. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: beg to move amendment No. 19, in page 5, line 6, leave out " 15 " and insert "17"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I moved amendments Nos. 12, 13 and 23 earlier in our proceedings, I dealt fairly fully and comprehensively with the arguments for ending the use of prison department custody for juveniles. I shall not repeat those arguments in moving this amendment, which would actually raise the minimum age for youth custody sentence to 17. I therefore move the amendment formally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to raise a further point on clause 4 and this amendment, apart from those which we argued at some length on earlier amendments—the distinction which the clause makes between the position of males and females. In case of males, the age of 15 is the operative age, but for females, by virtue of subsection (3) of the clause, the operative age is 17. We raised this previously as a matter of substance and the Minister gave a reply that I do not think any Labour Member regarded as satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this context I raise a different aspect of the matter. I want to ask the Minister whether he, or the law officers of the Crown, have considered the possibility—which in my view is something more than a possibility—that this differentiation by way of sex in clause 6 would be in contravention of our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights. The Committee will recollect that article 5 of that convention deals with the right to liberty and in general terms provides that—
	<br><blockquote><p>" No one shall be deprived of his liberty "—</p></blockquote>
save in certain cases which are set out and which include—
	<br><blockquote><p>" the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court".</p></blockquote>
In article 14 of the convention we find that—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>" The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as "—</p></blockquote>
the first of the grounds mentioned is " sex ". The other grounds are not matters with which we are concerned in relation to this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So there is under the convention, as I understand it, a clear obligation not to discriminate on the ground of sex between males and females when it comes to depriving them of liberty. I cannot see how the provision in the clause can be viewed as being other than discrimination and I think it extremely likely that if this matter were taken before the European Commission of Human Rights the view that I have expressed would be supported by the Commission—that this clause, if enacted in this form, would be declared unlawful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Home Office in particular has inevitably been under the scrutiny of the Commission, and it has
	<span class='label label-info column'>202</span>
not always emerged unbattered. I would not wish that fate to be suffered by either the present Home Secretary or the Minister if it can be avoided and it seems to me that it is avoidable by removing this discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The form of the amendment is, of course, not the only way in which the discrimination can be avoided; but it is a way and it gives the opportunity for the point to be raised. Perhaps the Home Office has not taken the advice of the law officers of the Crown. It is within my memory that the Department most reluctant to do so always appears to be the Home Office. I am not speaking about Home Office Ministers when making that comment. Home Office Ministers, in my experience, occasionally invite the help of the Attorney-General. They do not always follow his advice, but that is a different matter. However, there seems to be a remarkable reluctance on the part of the Department more generally to do so. On this occasion the Minister might think it desirable to do and so if he were to give his assurance that he would, I would not wish to force the amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support what my right hon. and learned Friend has said. This amendment is simple. It is logical and it abolishes discrimination on the ground of sex. We have advocated since the beginning of the Bill a single sentence of youth custody for both boys and girls. We believe that no boys or girls under 17 should be in custody and that the Bill should take the opportunity to eliminate such anomalies instead of perpetuating them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause presents yet a second anomaly between the treatment of the sexes which is not only unjust but discriminates against boys and makes it unnecessarily complicated as a Bill. The Minister failed to give an explanation of why detention centres are, in his view, an appropriate and suitable place to put boys but an inappropriate and unsuitable ' place to put girls. That a custodial sentence of under four months can be applied to boys under 17 but not to girls could be submitted to the European Commission on Human Rights. A boy under 17 can be sent to a detention centre for up to four months or youth custody for more than four months, whereas there is no custodial sentence at all under four months for a girl. The provision is, therefore, not only complicated but illogical and discriminatory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard from the hon. and learned Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve) of the violent crime among girls even as young as 14, so it is not as if there is less violent crime in that age group. Admittedly, numerically the number of girl offenders, or found guilty of offences, is smaller but that does not seem to justify different treatment for those who do offend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would clarify and simplify the whole Bill by saying that there should be no custodial sentence for boys or girls under 17 either in detention centres or in youth custody.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ormskirk for recognising that we have been round this course before and therefore moving his amendment formally. In a sentence, the Government believe that it is essential that there should be custodial
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0247">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>203</span>
provision for the courts in their discretion for juvenile offenders—the 15 to 17-year-olds—bearing in mind that the Bill includes the requirement that the courts shall be satisfied that no non-custodial sentence would be appropriate for that individual case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to address myself at slightly greater length to the points which have been raised about discrimination between boys and girls in this context. I agree with the hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) that this would be swept away were the amendment carried, because then there would be provision for anybody under the age of 17, boy or girl, for custodial sentence. I agree that this blemish, as she sees it—although I do not acknowledge it to be one—would be swept away, but I am afraid that the baby would go out with the bathwater for the reasons which we have already examined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that markedly fewer offences of this kind are committed by girls than by boys and we have found in practice that we can manage without a short custodial sentence for younger girls. The number of girls who offend is much smaller than the number of boys, and although I must acknowledge that local authorities sometimes find it difficult to cope with individual disturbed girl offenders who need to be held in secure care, it does not happen to such an extent as to warrant the introduction of a new short sentence. That is how it seems to us, at present at any rate. Offences by juvenile boys is on a much larger scale and the courts could not manage without a short custodial sentence in their case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just because offending by boys takes place more often, does that justify treating them differently from girls who commit similar offences?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think so, and I think that our constituents think the same. The duty of Government is to protect our citizens from violence in particular. That is not our exclusive role but it is an important limb. Our constituents, who are also taxpayers, would probably say that we have managed so far with the present limited accommodation of secure care for juvenile girls without imposing on local authorities a liability for custodial sentences. Local authorities may have occasional difficulties but they do not think that the risks to the general public warrant introducing a new custodial sentence when there has not been one for so many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the hon. Lady attaches the deepest importance to equality in all possible respects in the law affecting men and women, boys and girls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the point raised by the right hon. and learned Gentleman about whether this is in breach of our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights. We have no reason to suppose that it is. Nobody has made such a complaint. People have not exactly been backward in coming forward to invite the Home Office to contribute to the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights so far. We have made a distinguished contribution over the years to that jurisprudence. The European convention protects providing for equal
	<span class='label label-info column'>204</span>
rights to due process before loss of liberty. It does not provide for equal liability to loss of liberty. These are to some extent uncharted waters, and the best compilers of charts find that their views about where the rocks and shoals lie do not always prove accurate. That, however, is our understanding of the matter, and we have no reason to suppose that something that does not provide for equal liability to lose one's liberty is in breach of the convention, the purpose of which is to protect by providing equal rights to due processes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman keeps turning the argument round and implying that I want equal treatment for girls to be locked up. That is not what I am saying, and he persists in turning this argument round, as he did on detention centres. We are asking for equal opportunity for boys not to be given custodial sentences under the age of 17, in the same way that a girl under 17 cannot be given a custodial sentence for under four months. There is discrimination, therefore, as I said earlier, not against girls but against boys. He always turns the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nantwich) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree with my hypothesis that it would be unthinkable for the Government, in all the circumstances which the Committee has already considered, to abolish the proposition for the possible custody of boys, if they offend seriously enough. Therefore, should the European Convention of Human Rights find against the Government, the only logical and practicable conclusion would be to introduce custodial sentences for girls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Halifax and to my hon. Friend the Member for Nantwich (Sir Nicholas Bonsor). My hon. Friend is absolutely right. We cannot accord boys the same immunity from custodial sentences as girls—that is immunity of this kind, for they are not immune, for example, from section 53—because we cannot manage without the custodial sentences of borstal at present, and youth custody as it will be and also provide proper protection for the public. My hon. Friend the Member for Nantwich is right. If we pursue this Holy Grail of equality in every possible context, the only outcome would be as he suggests. However, we should not take much longer over this. I have listened with great care to what has been said, and these matters are always under review, but I do not consider that the points which have been raised warrant my advising the Committee to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, West) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot allow the Government to get away with the compliments heaped upon them by the hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill). She says that the Government are discriminating in favour of females against males, and that the males are downtrodden because the Government are so keen to favour females. The real position is one, from the Government's point of view, of practicalities. They believe if girls were subject to custodial sentences from the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0248">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>205</span>
age of 15, so few of them would receive those sentences that it would not be economic to set up a special institution. Therefore, they are prepared, because of the economies of the situation, to allow the few girls who probably should go to such institutions, not to go. That is what it boils down to. It seems to me to be an argument basically about economics. It is not their intention to favour girls over boys at all. If many more girls were doing the sort of thing that would result in custodial sentences, the Government would make the age level for girls the same as it is for boys. I do not see that as a sex equality issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are operating purely on economic criteria because they have too few custodial institutions for the number of people who have to go there. That is the basis of the differentiation. They are prepared to let a few girls get away with it rather than set up a whole new institution to house them—an institution which might well be unpopulated most of the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percy Grieve 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Solihull)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) said that boys were not being given the same opportunity of avoiding custodial sentences. Is not the reason—and it fits in with what the hon. and learned Gentleman has been saying—that they have exactly the same opportunity if they take it by avoiding committing crimes on such a large scale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyons</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that one can talk about the sexes in that way. It seems to me that the Home Office is simply going on past experience. It has taken the view so far that it cannot fill an institution for girls in this age group, or it does not want to spend the money and take up the space in doing so, and accordingly has made a differentiation. I do not think that any special principle is involved nor that there is any intention to give girls better treatment than boys. There is no charity in the Home Office from that point of view. It is simply that the economic practicalities have driven them to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not clear on which side of the fence the hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons) will fall. Is he saying that one can justify discrimination by sex on economic grounds? If so, that is a very interesting proposition on which I should like the views of the European Court of Human Rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyons</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that one can justify it. I have just explained what seem to me to be the reason for the situation. For example, if every year the provisions were equal and one girl of 16 was sentenced to a custodial sentence, it would not be very sensible to create a special institution for that one girl. That is the reductio ad absurdum of the argument. The Government appear to me to be recognising that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be arguments that the age for boys should be lifted from 15 to 17. That is different from saying that it should be lifted to 17 because the age for girls is 17. That is an economic argument. The argument for raising the level for boys to 17 should be made, in my view, on different
	<span class='label label-info column'>206</span>
grounds from that it simply has to be 17 because 17 is the minimum age for girls, and very few girls fall into that category.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I understand that the Minister is willing to accept this amendment. That is such an unheralded feature of our debates that I do not wish to press him so far that he may forgo that charity. Therefore I move the amendment briefly, merely pointing out that there is no point in a court's having to state its reasons unless it does so publicly. Where the provision has been made in the past for a stereotyped reason to be given by magistrates' courts, it has often not been said in court but has been left to the clerk to include in the written record. That has been an unsatisfactory feature of similar provisions in the past, and I want it stated in public so that, if need be, an appeal can be made on that basis. I am glad that the Minister is accepting the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an amendment which I can properly, as well as happily, advise the Committee to accept. The point that is perhaps insufficiently recognised is that the Bill extends to sentences of youth custody—which will be, as it were, the successor of borstal—and to detention centre custody the obligation imposed by the existing law that the courts must be satisfied that no non-custodial sentence would be appropriate. We are enlarging that obligation to youth custody and to detention centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In so far as there may remain any who mistakenly take the view that the Bill is too custodial in its flavour and that the Government are too keen on custody, that is the whole answer. We are extending the obligation on the court to satisfy itself that a non-custodial sentence would not be appropriate. To the extent that we are enlarging that provision and making new law, there may be advantage in putting this reminder in the Bill that not only shall the matter be considered in the way I have outlined but that the reasons shall be expressed in court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
certainly the amendment can do no harm, and there is a marginal area in which it may do good. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for putting the amendment down and for the clarity and ability with which he has argued it. I am glad to be able to recommend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C.Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 25, in page 5, line 27, at end add "and
	<br><blockquote><p>(c) in a case where a detention centre order is precluded by section 2(5)(a) above, that there are special circumstances (whether relating to the offence or to the offender) which warrant the passing of a sentence of youth custody in that case.".</p></blockquote>
This subsection deals with the situation in which a court takes the view that a detention centre order is precluded by certain provisions in clause 2, notwithstanding that a sentence of four months or less would be appropriate, and is therefore empowered to pass a custody sentence. The relevant provision of clause 2 is in subsection 5(a) that the court considers that a detention centre order would be unsuitable because of the offender's mental or physical condition but none the less takes the view that a custodial sentence of not more than four months would be appropriate and in those circumstances youth custody can be ordered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is common ground—if I have correctly read the guidance that the Minister has kindly given—that it is thought and certainly hoped that it would be a rare circumstance for the court to think a person unfit for a detention centre but nevertheless thinks it right to exercise its power to pass a short youth custody sentence. The purpose of my amendment is to enshrine that hope in the Bill, in words similar
	<span class='label label-info column'>208</span>
to those used in a clause we debated earlier, by making express provision that in such cases the court must be satisfied that there are special circumstances, whether relating to the offence or to the offender—I am adopting the words of the earlier clause—which warrant or sentence of youth custody.

It is a small additional precaution which would make clear to the court that that which I think we all hope for is that which ought to be achieved and that they should not have to resort to youth custody in those circumstances unless there really are special reasons. I hope that the Minister will look favourably on that proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During the first sitting on 4 February I drew the attention of the Committee to the position of those young offenders who were mentally or physically unfit and therefore unable to serve a detention centre sentence and who, under the provisions of the Bill, will receive a youth custody sentence. Paragraph 17 of the Governments White Paper " Young Offenders " stated that young people who were unfit for a detention centre sentence were most likely to serve their sentences in an adult local prison. I then pointed to the fact that some of the most appalling conditions within the penal system as a whole actually existed in the local adult prisons to which the physically and mentally unfit young people were likely to be sent. These are the prisons which are least likely to have a constructive and positive environment to help the young offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the sitting on 16 February the Minister told the Committee that the Government had given this matter further consideration. He said first that every effort would be made to place all the young offenders under 17 and some of those over 17 into youth custody centres. He pointed out, however, that those aged 17 and over would probably go to adult prisons where they would serve their sentences either in a hospital wing or in a young prisoners' wing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That announcement is clearly to be welcomed. It is an important announcement and an important move on the position that existed when the White Paper was published. The Government deserve credit for having taken another look at the problem in the short time during which we have been debating the Bill. Even so, the position still remains unsatisfactory as long as any young person concerned ends up in an adult prison. I am sure that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin), my hon. Friends and, indeed, hon. Gentlemen opposite will also regard it as deplorable that any individual who is considered unfit for reasons of physical or mental condition to serve a detention centre sentence should instead be held in what we all accept to be the deplorable and, in some cases, appalling conditions of adult prisons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In case any Member of the Committee thinks that placing these young people in young prisoner wings means that they will enjoy decent or civilised conditions, perhaps I ought to disabuse them by quoting from the comments on the White Paper " Young

Offenders" made by the prison and borstal governors' branch of the Society of Civil and Public Servants. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… it is necessary only to point to the most unacceptable face of the existing arrangements for young offenders in custody—the number of young prisoners held in local prisons for part or the whole of their sentence. This is nothing short of a national scandal. Pressures on the system make it impossible to provide reasonable let alone separate facilities for them. They are squeezed into a bank of cells at the end of a wing or landing or, in the ease ol one local prison, into a basement. Recreational facilities are meagre and sometimes non-existent. The same applies to work and physical education. It is only remarkable that control and other problems are not more severe, but staff of local prisons will invariably highlight this group as this most difficult one to manage in prevailing conditions."</p></blockquote>
Those are fairly outspoken words. They are not my words or the words of hon. Members but words of the prison and borstal governors, a highly reputable and respectable body of people, and also a very experienced body in dealing with the problems of the people about whom we are talking. It is unsatisfactory and indeed unacceptable that those who are physically or mentally unable to face the rigours of a detention centre should instead have to be compelled to suffer the kind of conditions which I have just described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The all-party penal affairs group report, " Young Offenders—A Strategy for the Future", said in paragraph 227,
	<br><blockquote><p>" We recommend that those young offenders for whom a custodial sentence exceeding four months is inappropriate but who are mentally unfit for detention centre regimes should not receive any form of custodial sentence. Since these are cases where by definition only a short custodial sentence is being considered, the offenders concerned will not be among those who represent the most serious danger to the community and a suitable non-custodial sentence, where appropriate involving treatment for the offenders' mental condition within the National Health Service should be imposed."</p></blockquote>
My right hon. and learned Friend's amendment does not go as far as that recommendation, but it goes some way towards achieving the objective of providing that short custodial sentences should only be imposed on such an offender if there are special circumstances. For that reason I welcome the amendment as a step in the right direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) described the effect of his amendment as making a small additional provision. I entirely understand his objective, which is one that I share. We all want to make sure that in no case where it can reasonably be avoided shall somebody go to youth custody as a young offender merely because he has not qualified, by reason of physical or mental fitness, for the detention centre order that would primarily be appropriate. That was why, in the notes on clauses which I thought it would be helpful to distribute to the Committee in advance, we said that it is hoped that, because of clause 1(4), the court would in most such cases try to avoid passing a custodial sentence at all—that is, where somebody is physically or mentally unfit for a detention centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with particular care in the right hon. and learned Gentleman's speech for any indication
	<span class='label label-info column'>210</span>
of what would in substance be added by the amendment. I will say at the outset that, if there were something of real substance, I would consider it very sympathetically, but I cannot see that anything of substance is added; these would merely be additional words which might well lead to uncertainty and confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would add a further qualification to the way in which the court is to exercise its powers. By the time a court, however, came to consider the provision which the amendment seeks to insert, it would already have made the following determinations, if it approached the task as the Bill requires. First, it would have satisfied itself that there was no other appropriate method other than a custodial sentence of dealing with the offender. That is in clause 1(4). Secondly, it would, in reaching that conclusion, have considered information about the circumstances, and about the offender's character and his physical and mental condition. That is clause 1(7). Thirdly, the court would have decided that the appropriate term would be one of not more than four month—o clause 2(1). Lastly, it would have decided that a detention centre order would be unsuitable because of the offender's physical or mental condition-clause 2(5)(a), to which the right hon. and learned Gentleman has drawn attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that a court that has gone through all those steps would face the inexorable conclusion that it must pass a short youth custody sentence under clause 4(2). It is at that point, if the amendment were to be carried, that the court would have to pause and consider whether there were special circumstances which warranted the passing of such a sentence. " Special" by what criterion? All the relevant criteria, I believe, will have been considered in the steps I have outlined. I do not think it sits easily with the absolute requirement that the court must in any case be satisfied that no other method of dealing with the offender than custody is appropriate. It is that circumstances alone which warrants the passing of a custodial sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were some matter of substance which would be added by the amendment to the matters which the court must take into consideration, I should want to consider it seriously. But for the reasons that I have given I do not see that it would add anything but words, and I know that the right hon. and learned Gentleman would agree that, if that is the case, it would be a mistake to add to the clause in this way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the Minister on previous occasions, I shall want to consider what has been said in the light of his remarks and those of my hon. Friends. In particular, I shall want to see how what he has just said is distinguishable from the provision set out in clause 2(6), from which the wording of the amendment is derived. There, too, the initial consideration would be that the court considered that only a custodial sentence would be adequate for the offence and the offender. Nonetheless, in the circumstances of someone who has served previous
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0251">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>211</span>
sentences the court is empowered to make an order, given special circumstances, which again are not defined—we debated that on another occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have accepted what seems to me to be the principle behind the amendment, which I propose for those circumstances, and I certainly wish to think hard about what the Minister has said to see whether I can see some grounds for his view that a similar provision would not be suitable in this .case. My own feeling is that it would be at the very least a valuable reminder to the courts that they should not lightly tell themselves that a certain young person was not fit for a detention centre and should be sent to penal custody instead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the Minister's point that they should theoretically, and in most cases they would practically, go through the exercise of first asking whether a custodial sentence is unavoidable. That equally applies to the position under clause 2. Human nature tends to suggest that, having gone through that exercise, and having perhaps originally reached the conclusion that a custodial sentence is necessary with the background of a detention centre order in mind, when they are told that there are physical or mental reasons why the offender should not go to a detention centre, there will be courts which will say, " Well, in that case we had better send him to youth custody ". That is the basis of what I have in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will also look at the amendment again in the light of what I have said. With that hope, and having regard to my own intention to look at it again, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no provision in the text of the Bill, apart from the repeal clauses, that deals with the repeal of section 3 of the 1961 Act, but in effect that has been done by the provisions of clause 1. However that is manifestly relevant to the consideration of clause 5 about the maximum length of youth custody that may be imposed by a court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister, along with most of the legal establishment, has always been opposed to section 3 of the 1961 Act even though it was passed by a Conservative Government. But it was a necessary corrective, in my view, to the capacity of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>212</span>
judiciary at every level to pass sentences of imprisonment that were inappropriate. Until this Bill is passed the judges have a manifest custodial alternative. They can send young people to borstal or to a detention centre. In future they will have the capacity to send them to a detention centre but not to borstal, and therefore section 3 becomes otiose; But what is not otiose is the capacity of the courts to send people for longer and longer periods of custodial sentence, even if it is called youth custody. Under the provisions of the Bill youth custody can become imprisonment if the sentence goes on until the offender is over 21, because it is up to the Home Secretary to decide where the sentence is served, and it is possible to serve it in an adult prison, and even to serve a substantial period in an adult prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What concerns me about the text of the Bill as it stands is this. Under the tariff system so far, what would happen to a young person who came before the court? It is likely that he would get a noncustodial sentence initially appropriate to the offence. He might then go to a detention centre and after that he might go to borstal. If he came back again after serving a period in borstal he might be sent back to borstal, either by recall or on a new sentence. However, by the time he reached the age of 21 the likelihood is that he would not have served any period of imprisonment. When he came before the court at 21 it would decide that in view of his bad record it could not overlook the offence and that it must send him to prison. He had never been to prison before and prison would be a great culture shock for him, therefore six months, or three months, or two months might be an appropriate sentence because he would be tasting a form of custodial treatment that he had never had before, even though he had been in and out of custody since he was 13 or 14.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the provisions of the Bill, however, the courts will not be thinking in those terms at all. The offender will be sent to a detention centre on his first custodial sentence, and then the courts will begin the whole process of differing terms of youth custody. No doubt he will start with two or three months of youth custody. Then he will come back again after having done two months or three months, and he will be given six months. He will serve four months of that and will come out again. Then he will go back again and this time he will get a year. By the time he gets to 21 he might very well already have served sentences of up to 18 months—or maybe even two years—of youth custody, because it would be posible within the time span to have done that. When he gets to 21 the courts will have to decide what should then be done with an offender who has already been through youth custody for periods of 12 months, 18 months or two years. Are they to decide that he should go to prison for three months?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can hon. Members imagine what the court would say in such a situation? He has already served 21 months, so what is the point of sending him to prison for three months? The courts will decide that, since he has already served 21 months' youth
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0252">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>213</span>
custody, they should now sentence him to three years in pirson. That seems to me to be the trap which is laid bare by this provision in the Bill, and I am certain that it is not what the Minister or the Home Office ever intended. But I am absolutely certain that that is the way that the tariff mentality of the judiciary will apply it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall find that instead of reducing the number of people in prison, which is supposed to be one of the aims of the Government, there will be a whole new operating of the tariff so that there will be more people in prison. We all know that the overcrowding in prison at the moment relates to local prisons, in relation to sentences of four years or less. Although it is sometimes argued that the problem is caused by people who go to prison for long periods and by those who have been sentenced to life imprisonment, the fact is that the real overcrowding occurs amongst prisoners who are serving shorter sentences. If the sentences of all those who are sent to prison at the moment for four years or less were halved, the prison population would fall dramatically from about 45,000 to about 34,000. Therefore that is the area of deepest concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is precisely in that area that this provision will have its biggest impact, not because of the youth custody part of it, but because it will increase the tariff rating for the higher courts for those over the age of 21. It will increase the tariff also for magistrates' courts because they, too, will have to consider what to do in relation to somebody who has had substantial periods of youth custody when he comes before them at the age of 21. It is true that their powers have not been increased—so they can still only pass a sentence of six months for one offence, and 12 months in total—but they are more likely to get further towards the limit on that tariff than is customary at the moment. For that reason I think there is a real danger in this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to approach this matter with some kind of tie upon the powers of the courts to sentence people to whatever limit of youth custody they think appropriate. Since it is an experimental thing,
	<span class='label label-info column'>214</span>
and we do not know how it will hit the judiciary, and all the indications in the past have been that the judiciary have perverted the objectives of any method of custodial treatment that has been intended to reduce sentencing, I think we should approach this with some hesitancy. Therefore I suggest one of two alternative methods of dealing with it. The first is to cut the maximum tariff by half by saying that the court can sentence a person to youth custody only for half the period which is allowed for adult offenders. That was the approach of the Advisory Council on the Penal System in its report on sentencing in the early 1970s. Frankly, I have never been greatly impressed by that approach but it is one way that we might try.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other is more specifically to say in relation to children under 15 that the Government are taking power to say that a person under that age cannot be sentenced to more than 12 months, and there should be a limit for people on youth custody between the age at which that limitation applies, and the age of 21. If that is the position I think that the amendment which I most favour is amendment No. 27, which puts a maximum limit on the period that can be served by offenders in this category. It would be 12 months on the first occasion that they are sentenced to youth custody and 24 months on any subsequent occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that 24 months is a more than adequate sentence for any offence that would fall within this provision, especially if the Minister still intends to keep clause 53(2). If he were not to keep clause 53(2) we might have a slightly higher tariff for the more serious offences. I am anxious to urge him to consider that initially there should be some check. If we do not have that I suspect that the initiative that he is launching in this provision will actually go wrong in the same way as every other penal initiative has gone wrong in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
