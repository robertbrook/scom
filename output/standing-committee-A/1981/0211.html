	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to follow the hon. Member for Huddersfield, West (Mr. Dickens) in the Prime Minister's Questions on Tuesday and say that I have forgotten what I was about to say, but by the miracle of 	<i>Hansard</i> I am reminded that I was in the middle of a sentence referring to an intervention from the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve), who claimed that nobody is elevated to high judicial office unless he has already been a Crown court recorder or a chairman of Quarter Sessions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percy Grieve 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Solihull)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not misquote me. I did not say "noboby", I said it was rare, on the common law side, for persons to be elevated to high judicial office unless they had some experience as recorders, chairmen of Quarter Sessions and the like.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I now have a verbatim repetition of what the intervention was, and I can therefore reply to it. The answer I was about to give was that when the Select Committee on Home Affairs was considering the prison population it had evidence from the chairman of the Bar Council and the chairman of the Criminal Bar Association. We asked them about judicial experience before appointment. Each of these gentlemen is likely, I suppose, in due course to be a member of the high judiciary. Certainly, the chairman of the Criminal Bar Association admitted that he had never been to a borstal and that he had very limited experience of a prison, only going to see a prisoner whom he was representing. If that be so, it indicates the point I was trying to make, which is not really refuted by the point made by the hon. and learned Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not an answer to say that people who are appointed to the High Court come from the Crown court. The question really is what manner of experience had they when they got to the Crown court, and indeed what kind of experience do they accumulate when they are on the Crown court Bench. The answer is very little about the nature of the sentence
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>76</span>
imposed. We all know the tariffs. That is what we learn in the art of advocacy throughout the years at the Bar. We all know also when we get on to the Bench that by and large if we get outside the tariff there is a possibility that we might be overturned on appeal. We all know that, but sometimes we take our lives in our hands and decide that we will do it none the less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is different from knowing what we are doing to a person when we send him to borstal or for two, three, four or five years to prison, and what it means in terms of his life. Every member of the Bar would say " I have read these social inquiry reports that come back on people who are hardened criminals. They tell us what happened after the last occasion and we build up that catalogue of experience ".To some extent that is true, but it is not true that people who are at the Bar or who get on the Bench know the results of the researches that have been done on the effects of punishment over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is now an abundance of experience and a wealth of information available which ought to be available to anybody who does this job, because it is an immensely important job and its has immensely important effects, not only for the individuals dealt with as they come before the courts but for society generally. We simply do not train our judiciary in the way that they ought to be trained. I remember raising this at Question Time and the Minister replying that things had changed since the day that I was appointed as deputy circuit judge. 1 hope they have, because all the training I got was one afternoon in the court of the Lord Chief Justice when we dealt with a few problems and the Court of Appeal judge told us where we were going wrong in our assessments. That was it. Then I was up to the Bench and I was able to deal with people whom I could sentence to four, five, six, seven, eight, 10 years, or even life. I think the highest I have ever given was two years. I took the view, of which I am trying to persuade the Government, that it is not necessary to send people to prison for the kind of sentencing that we do. What we have learnt at the Bar, when get on the Bench is not the impact of sentencing upon the prisoner or, indeed, upon society, but the tariff that will be allowed by the Court of Appeal. Therefore, we work within the tariff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I was quick to intervene in the hon. and learned Gentleman's remarks the other day about burglary. Of course, there is a tariff for burglary. Of course, there is a tariff for rape, though to judge by some of the comments that were made in the early part of this month, one would never have believed it. It is very difficult to escape a prison sentence for rape. In judging what the tariff is we are not talking about what the impact on the prisoner or, indeed, on society will be. We are talking about the current view which is formed in a Bar mess, in the chambers in the Bar or by the judges over the years about what they think is the right kind of punishment to give in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that, I accept, is a process of education, but it is not a process of education about what the reality of punishment is. We must get that message across. For that reason I am wholly of the view that nobody should go on to the Bench, or the Criminal Bench, at any rate, whether it is the magistrates' Bench, the Crown court Bench or the High Court Bench, unless
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>77</span>
they have had at least six months in which they are not sentencing anybody. They should be taken round penal establishments and subjected to the information which is now available about the effect of penal establishments so that they know that it is not necessary to have these high tariffs in order to do justice to the prisoner and to the public. It is quite unnecessary to have this length of sentencing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the first thing we must get across, and I do not think that that will necessarily be helped by this series of amendments. Secondly, if the judiciary will not be trained in that way, and so far they have shown a good deal of resistance to it, surely we must then limit the discretion of the judiciary. That seems a heresy in a Bill that seeks to eradicate the one great major check on judicial discretion in section 3 of the 1961 Act. We shall come to that in due course. I think there has to be, until we introduce this element of judicial training, some kind of limitation upon discretion. That is what my hon. Friends are trying to do in this amendment. They are trying to use the two criteria that ought to be used in relation to custodial sentence in order to limit what the judiciary do. My only concern about that—I will support these amendments wholeheartedly—is whether it can be successful, because, as the Minister indicated in his speech, in 1948 we tried to do this for juvenile offenders and the impact of the words used, which are now the words in the Present Bill, was that a person should not be sent to custody unless the court is
	<br><blockquote><p>"…of the opinion that no other method of dealing with him is appropriate."</p></blockquote>
Those words were used in the 1948 Act in relation to juvenile offenders, and because they were so casually dealt with by the courts it was the Conservative Government in 1961 who introduced section 3 in order to try to restrict still further the capacity of the judiciary to send young people to custody. In that case they were told that they could not send people to prison between the ages of 17 and 21 unless it was for less than six months or more than three years. That has bitten—at least it has bitten for quite a long time—and because it has bitten it is bitterly resented by the judiciary, whereas the original words, similar to the ones in this Bill, did not bite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that in relation to the criteria that my hon. Friends are proposing, the very same thing may happen—that we shall get judiciary doing what it has always done, but simply saying, if is is called upon to say anything at all, that it is acting within two criteria put forward in the amendment. At least they must try to restrict its thinking to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept the suggestion made by the hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons) that the amendment means that a person cannot be sent to prison on a first offence for rape or murder. I should have thought that custodial sentencing, necessary for the protection of the public, entirely embraced such a sentence. It is indicative of this that the Minister of State did not deal with that point when he talked about imposing an obligation never to send a person to prison unless he had already had a non-custodial sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely the answer is the disjunctive in the amendment, for he can be sent to a custodial sentence either if he has proved unwilling to respond to non-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
custodial or because a custodial sentence is necessary for the protection of the public, which must mean that the second restriction relates to those people who have not been sentenced to a custodial sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that sense, therefore, these two cover the great majority of sentencing—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Ocffle (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The great majority—that is the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the whole point of the amendment is to cut out what it does not cover. It is deliberately designed to ensure that people are not sent to prison for reasons other than the two contained in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, I support it and would do so with greater vigour if I thought it would actually work. The reason why the 1948 restriction did not work and why the same words were used in the First Offenders Act 1958—in order to stop magistrates' courts sending people to prison over 21 on a first offence—was that the reasons never had to be given in open court. They never had to be justified in terms of an individual case. At most, it had to be indicated that the statute was being conformed with in the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that we should add to the amendment that the court ought to justify why it takes the view that it comes within those two criteria. If we did that, it would be capable of being appealed and in that situation it may be possible to keep some kind of restraint on the judiciary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that basis, I support the amendment but I hope that my hon. Friend will consider putting in an amendment similar to the one I have put down on a later clause saying that the reasons should be given in open court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree wholeheartedly with the view that a strong attempt ought to be made to add to the words "appropriate" in order to make it even less likely that those who should not be given a custodial sentenoe are kept out of custodial institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in favour of any amendment to achieve that, but I am a little nervous, however, about the wording of this particular amendment because, unlike the hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon) it seems that the amendment as it now stands, would cause considerable difficulty and might not achieve what was sought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, it seems that a court might construe the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"necessary for the protection of the public"</p></blockquote>
as meaning necessary for the protection of the public from the person convicted and not necessary for the protection of the public from other persons who might follow the example of the person convicted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a court were to take the first of those alternatives, it would mean that the courts would feel unable to sentence for rape or murder by virtue of the wording of that amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dulwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. and learned Gentleman tell the Committee anything in the history of judicial sentencing which suggests that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>79</span>
the judiciary would be likely to take that sort of restricted view?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyons</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened to the right hon. and learned Gentleman, but I must say that the judiciary could take three alternative views of that wording—first, that it is for the protection of the public from the individual concerned; secondly, for the protection of the public from others who were not concerned in a particular offence; and, thirdly, or both. I do not see the advantage of inserting into legislation a deliberate ambiguity when it is possible to spell out exactly what one means. I should have thought that the right hon. and learned Gentleman would have known from his own experience as Attorney-General that ambiguity in legislation is the cause of great criticism and can get Attorneys-General into serious difficulty. I see no advantage in being ambiguous in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lest the right hon. and learned Gentleman thinks that those remarks are hostile in general, may I say that because I believe in the thrust of the amendment and what it seeks to achieve. If there is a vote I shall vote for the amendment simply because if it were passed it would force the Government to bring forward something perfect on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the reasons that I support the thrust of the amendment is that I agree with the hon. Member for York that those dealing in sentencing do not have adequate experience of prisons, borstals and modern penological thought. It is not true, as the hon. Member for York says, that there is no training now for recorders and judges. The reason he thinks there is no training is that he is a deputy circuit judge, and there is a flaw in the present arrangements in that training at the moment is restricted to recorders and judges and does not extend to deputy circuit judges. A deputy circuit judge is a barrister who sits on the Bench when no recorder or judge is available. I agree that they can do as much damage or as much good when they sit on the Bench as the regular recorders and judges. In those circumstances, there is an argument for them to receive training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I entirely agree with the hon. Member for York that the one week every three or four years set aside for training for recorders and judges is totally inadequate. Therefore, I accept his argument that in general there should be a good deal more training in this area. I also agree that from time to time persons are appointed to the Bench whose expertise has been in the civil sphere not in the criminal, and have therefore come as novices to the whole question of criminal sentencing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to have misled the hon. and learned Gentleman by a little jocularity. I accept that there is some judicial training both for recorders and even more for Crown court and High Court judges. I ought to know because I set up the committee that resulted in the education system being formed. It did not go as far as I wanted, and I am trying to push in on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyons</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman about that. We appear to take the same view. At the moment, a recorder who has had a good deal of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
criminal experience is equipped to know what his colleagues would be likely to do in the same situation, and therefore his sentence is likely to be within the tariff in the sense that broadly speaking he knows what others would do in similar circumstances. But that is not the same as knowing what is the correct sentence. It is only knowing what others in the profession would give from their experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sentencing, therefore, at the moment depends on experience of what others would do in the same occupation. There is no training to indicate whether, from other criteria, the sentence is correct. There is a complacency at the Bar that this experience acquired in dealing with many cases as an adovcate or as a judge equips one to know the correct sentence. I do not think that it does. On the other hand, it is also fair to say that judges today seek to keep people out of a custodial institution wherever possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not saying that mistakes do not occur, and that is why I support an amendment such as this. One of the reasons why the success rate of custodial institutions is so poor is that nowadays persons have usually been through the courts several times before they are sent to a borstal or a detention centre, whereas in the old days they were sent there much more often for a first or second offence. Therefore, in those days one could expect that there would be a lower recommittal rate to an institution for further offending. When I have been round borstals I have been told that many of the people coming in have been in front of the courts so often that it is very difficult by that time to achieve a recovery from criminal ways. None the less, I think the effort has to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact still remains absolutely clear that, for whatever reason, the present type of institution is not succeeding either in deterring people from committing crime or rehabilitating them. Having regard to the conditions in prison—three to a cell, and all that that means in terms of slopping out and so on—it is not surprising that a period in an institution takes away all self-respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no way round this. If someone who should not be in an institution is put with people, many of whom are determined and experienced criminals, he is likely to come out more an offender than he went in. That alone is why we should seek to keep people out of prison as far as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State went a little way in this direction when he spoke on Tuesday, but may I urge him to seek to strengthen the clause as it now stands even if he cannot accept the precise, yet ambiguous wording of the current amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At our last sitting I endeavoured to show the Committee that the Government were prepared to consider whether the objective, which we believe to be shared by all members of this Committee, could be more hopefully achieved by revision of the wording of this part of the clause. That was why I said that we were prepared to reconsider the matter and to see whether a better formulation could be arrived at. I thought it only fair to the Committee to show the difficulties that were inherent in the approach —not just the precise words—adopted by these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>81</span>
I apologise to the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) that I did not specifically refer to his own amendment which covers a narrower compass than the main ones. All I have to say about his amendment is that it would not be necessary at all and would not, in our view, achieve any practical good. It is not open to the same objections that I expressed about the main amendments in this group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essence of what I was trying to say was that where one is dealing with something that is necessarily an imprecise art or science—for example, sentencing— it is dangerous to seek to trammel, unless one has absolutely got to, the discretion that one is vesting in the people on whom one relies to exercise that judgment. Sentencing seems to me to fall fair and square into that category, and I thought it right to remind the Committee that the criterion under criticism is one that has been on the statute book since 1948, namely, the question of appropirateness and an obligation for the court to inform itself as to the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one says that it shall be appropriate only if conditions A and B are satisfied, one runs a great danger of other conditions C and D being excluded. In fact, one does not run a danger, one actually ensures that other conditions are excluded from the rule that one is propounding. It is that which I was trying to draw attention to. I was supported by the hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyon) on the terms of the amendment. He has said today that he is so in favour of restricting the discretion of the courts that notwithstanding the manifest inadequacies and ambiguities of the precise wording of the amendment, to which he drew proper attention and explicitly pointed out the dangers that stand out from that wording, he none the less wishes, as I understand it, to support the amendment. That is a matter for him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked by the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich to give an undertaking that I would accept the spirit of the amendment and come back with different words if that should be necessary to cover certain things that the movers may not have appreciated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is going further than I am able to do. It is extremely important, since so much of what has been said in the debate turns upon our respective views of the reliability of the judges to exercise the discretion which Parliament has given them over these years, that I should take up what has been said today by the hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon) and by the hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West. Frankly, the judges today—and 1 include the deputy circuit judges and circuit judges as well as the High Court judges —know a great deal more about the facets of sentencing to which both hon. Members drew attention today than is to be supposed from their speeches. This is not a matter of whim. It is not simply a matter of discussing what the tariff is, as I think the hon. Member for York was suggesting, in a Bar mess or in the Inns of Court. Judges have always gained a great deal of experience in judicial work and sentencing during their careers as advocates, but I accept that that is not enough and they accept that it is not enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I must point out that matters of training the judiciary are the responsibility of my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor, and not of my right hon.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>82</span>
Friend the Home Secretary, it is important and relevant to the debate that I should give an indication of what now takes place as common form. It is the culmination of a process going back certainly to 1963 when Lord Parker, the then Lord Chief Justice, introduced one-day conferences, but there is today a Judicial Studies Board set up as a result of the report of Lord Bridge, as he now is, in 1978. Today, every newly-appointed deputy circuit judge, before he first sits, spends a period of time, normally between five and 10 days, sitting in court with an experienced circuit judge, the precise period being determined by the presiding judge. He visits a prison and a borstal institution receiving offenders from the court at which he himself will be sitting. He also attends a residential induction seminar which includes a day of visits to prison establishments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The latest such seminar held in September, which I think my hon. and learned Friend for Solihull (Mr. Grieve) attended—because not only new judges attend—lasted for three-and-a-half days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Putting it bluntly, one is not allowed out except to go to penal establishments of one sort or another. I can speak without any kind of interest, because I hold no judicial office, never have done and it is extremely unlikely that I ever shall. [Hon. Members: " Ah ".]—I bow to the flattery that I know lies behind that response. However, the point is that this is really taken extremely seriously as it deserves to be and as the seriousness of the subject demands that it should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the end of the matter. Each year about 65 experienced judges and recorders are invited to attend a three-and-a-half-day residential judicial seminar which is also attended by newly-appointed High Court judges, almost all of whom will previously have sat as recorders or circuit judges. While attendance is not obligatory—the Government accept the view of the Judicial Studies Board that such an approach would not be practical—in practice, invitations to these newly-appointed judges are almost always accepted and when they are declined they are renewed next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the practicality of the matter is that everybody who gets an invitation, and who physically can, goes. It is worth recording that the latest such seminar held in September had as its theme " Short Sentences and Alternatives to Prison ". It opened with a review of 28 decisions of the Court of Appeal relevant to the shortening of sentences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have said enough to show a good deal more accurately the care that is taken today to see that those with judicial authority are instructed in the kind of matters that are important and have been the subject of the two speeches we have heard today. This is an important matter, and the position is far more reassuring than might have been supposed from those speeches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess I am not particularly reassured by the figures that the hon. and learned Gentleman has given. Can he tell us of any other jurisdiction in the world where judges get such an

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>83</span>
inadequate amount of judicial training? Of course, it is much better than it was in 1974—I accept that— but it is still a long way from perfect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most other judicial systems in the world have a judicial service that one joins at the age of 22 or 23 and, sadly in many cases, rises through the judicial ranks according to how he has kept his nose clean with the Government of the day. I would not wish this country to depart from our present procedures at all. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman recognises that there has been much improvement in recent years. The Government feel that substantial progress is being made in this area. We welcome very much the work and the influence of the Judicial Studies Board. The decision in principle by the Board to publish an information bulletin, perhaps quarterly, is a further welcome step. This project is now receiving detailed consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret having made a second speech at such length, but as this is a matter of such importance I felt it important that those who follow our affairs should be given a true picture of the extent to which training of the judiciary is carried out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman. Clearly, the position has improved considerably. The trend is in the correct direction. I am delighted to hear that newly appointed deputy circuit judges are now to receive this training, and I fully accept that ultimately recorders and judges have to receive a week's training. Does the hon. and learned Gentleman accept, without agreeing with the suggestion of the hon. Member for York, that there is still room for improvement? Does he also agree that one week, perhaps after 20 years on the Bench and no training before that is not sufficient? Should we not move to rather more than one week's training?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for me and it would be wrong for me to invade the responsibilities of my right hon. and learned Friend. But I feel I have said sufficient to show where the Government's heart lies in this matter—certainly where the heart of the Lord Chief Justice lies, who will take a greater part in encouraging and expanding judicial training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our last sitting I was assailed for suggesting that the judiciary did not sentence with minds closed to the wishes of Parliament and that, indeed, they were to be trusted. I was assailed also for suggesting that there might be good reasons, leading to a certain loss of confidence in some areas in supervision and probation orders, therefore leading in turn to the greater use of custodial sentences for young offenders that we all view with such anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Eventually, the pistol was held to my head by the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich in the terms that I have already mentioned this morning. Either one accepts the spirit of the amendment and returns simply with revised wording, or it will not be withdrawn and we shall vote on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had hoped to be able to indicate, in a conciliatory way, that the Government were considering it, but felt that I was obliged to set out the anxieties we feel. Relucatantly, I cannot go nearly as far as that, and therefore events must take their course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>84</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Kilroy-Silk 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ormskirk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments we have been discussing seek to add guidelines —indeed, using the Government's own words as expressed in their White Paper—to Clause 1(4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, the hon. and learned Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve) argued that on the one hand the amendments would be restrictive of judicial discretion. On the other hand, his hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale, (Mr. Trippier) during an intervention, said that the amendments are, in any event, unnecessary because it was what the courts were actually doing in practice. Both hon. Members cannot be right. Clearly, the evidence is that the courts are not implementing the kind of principles and sentiments described in the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fact, if the courts were operating on the basis of the principles laid down in the amendments, there would be no harm in accepting the amendments. In that sense, therefore, I expect the hon. Member for Rossendale to support them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. A. Trippier 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rossendale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman argues that at our previous sitting I said that this is already happening. Therefore, there can be no need for an amendment. That is the present practice and that is the point I was trying to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentelman's view is not shared by his hon. Friends or the Minister. If that is his view, he has no reason to oppose the amendment. Indeed, one would expect to find him in the Lobby supporting them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The courts are not doing what the hon. Member for Rossendale says they are doing. That is a reason for pressing the amendments. The figures given by the Opposition clearly demonstrate that the courts have not been following the principles as laid down in the amendments. That is clearly demonstrated in the DHSS Report, which has been quoted several times, entitled " Offending by Young People, A Survey of Recent Trends ", published in 1981.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That report and the figures provide the most powerful and eloquent case for this series of amendments. The hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons) and the Minister both made the point in earlier speeches, that if these amendments were implemented the courts would be prevented from passing custodial sentences on first-time offenders found guilty of murder, rape or something equivalent. That is clearly palpable nonsense, as has been pointed out by several of my hon. Friends. It is not the intention of the amendments, it is not my intention nor that of any of the signatories of the amendments that that would be the consequence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult and extremely doubtful to believe that the courts would put that kind of construction upon the words in the amendments. I accept that there is some concern and apprehension on this particular point, and I am therefore, prepared to look at the wording of the amendments again and to come back with a revised amendment that will meet that point. Indeed, I in the most useful intervention my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) suggested that we could use the words of the Government as set out in clause 2 (6), which mentions the " special circumstances," to allow a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0182">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>85</span>
custodial sentence to be passed over and above what would be considered to be the normal run of things as laid down by these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister in his much more helpful earlier intervention was considerate towards the principles enshrined in the amendments. He said that we are all seeking the same objectives and that we are all agreed on what we want to achieve. I was impressed by his conciliatory and helpful tone. All those who have spoken seem to be in favour of the principle. We are all in favour of getting it right. On that basis it seems sensible to withdraw the amendments—taking into account the reservations that have been made by the Minister to consult the learned Member for Croydon, North-West (Mr. Pitt), the hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons) and my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, South (Mr. Dubs)—and to come back with an amendment on Report that meets the points made both by the Minister and by those who have contributed to the debate. Therefore, on the clear understanding that we shall be able to come back to this very important issue on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend formally withdraws his amendment, could I ask what he would be seeking. I would seek that the Government come up with a proposal that would be much firmer than the words already in the Bill, as guidance, criteria and advice to the court. If they do not do this, we on this side of the House would certainly present a tighter draft than the one that we have already put on the Amendment Paper, that would cover any objections that have been made. Certainly, I cannot conceive of the judiciary interpreting the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"necessary for the protection of the public"</p></blockquote>
as far as a convicted rapist or someone convicted of serious violence is concerned, in any way other than to ensure that he or she was sent into custody for a long period. In order to cover that point, I would be quite happy if my hon. Friend would put on the Amendment Paper on Report formal guidelines that would eradicate any possible weakness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend is quite right. Like him, I would prefer the Government to come back on Report with an amendment laying down the principles enjoined in this particular amendment. We have not yet had that commitment from them. All we have had is a commitment to consider the issue. Indeed, in his earlier intervention on Tuesday, the Minister spoke of his commitment to consider what he called the important speeches that had been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I can say is that, on behalf of my hon. Friends who are supporting the amendment, I shall table a further amendment on Report which will take into account the important points and reservations that have been made from both sides of the Committee. We shall try to tighten up the amendment and get it right. We expect to debate it on Report in the light of what has been said in Committee. If the Government choose subsequently to table a better and stronger amendment, they will find that I, and no doubt my hon. Friends will support it, but in the absence of any
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>86</span>
commitment, I must make it clear that we shall table another amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 7, in—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"information about the circumstances" and insert "a social inquiry report about him and his circumstances made by a probation officer or by a social worker of a local authority social services department."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we can discuss amendment No. 8, in page 2, line 22, after—
	<br><blockquote><p>"circumstances" insert "of the offence and the offender."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that before the courts pass a custodial sentence on a young offender they are obliged to obtain and consider a social inquiry report. This is not a novel suggestion; neither do I put it forward as a radical suggestion. In my view, it is the minimum that should be done to ensure that the purpose of the Bill, which is to provide that as few people as possible are sent to custody is carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say that it is not a new suggestion, and indeed it is not. In its 1970 report on young adult offenders, the Advisory Council on the Penal System was clear about the value it placed on social inquiry reports and the importance it attached to them as a means of obtaining a comprehensive assessment of a young person's background, his propensity to commit further offences and how he could best be dealt with in order to prevent his continuing on a career of crime. It described social inquiry reports as
	<br><blockquote><p>"the most comprehensive source of information which the courts have about an offender."</p></blockquote>
I cannot improve upon that glowing tribute. The advisory council recommended that the courts should be required to obtain and consider social inquiry reports when passing a custodial sentence on a young offender for the first time. I accept that it recommended something that did not go as far as the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the advisory council also recommended that the courts should normally consider a social inquiry report before passing any sentence. It did not, however, suggest that the recommendation that it should normally be considered before passing any sentence should be incorporated in the statute. The Labour Government's Green Paper went further. It proposed that a social inquiry report should be required before any custodial sentence was passed. That recommendation forms the basis of these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that the Government should give a commitment to go at least as far as the advisory council recommended. If the hon. and learned Gentleman were to give an undertaking to do that, I would be happy to withdraw my amendment, which goes further for an amendment in those terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reality is that however much lip-service is paid to social inquiry reports—and I accept that they are widely used in the courts—the figures seem to indicate that young people are given custodial sentences without social inquiry reports being considered. I do not want to exaggerate the situation. I do not suggest for one moment that a large number of youngsters are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0183">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>87</span>
being sent to custody without social inquiry reports being considered and I would ask the Minister of State if he could publish the figures for the nembers of youngsters who are sent to custody without such reports being considered. Certainly, there are some. All the inquiries being considered. Certainly, there are some. All the inquiries indicate that that is so. The Association of Social Workers points out that in 1965 approximately 72,000 social inquiry reports were prepared for juvenile courts. In 1978 there were only approximately 75,000, despite the increasing workload of the juvenile courts, and we have heard that during that time crime by young people rose something like threefold. Those figures indicate that in some cases social inquiry reports have not been asked for and that some people who might have benefited as a result of recommendations in the social inquiry reports did not have the benefit of a social inquiry report being considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the advantages of a social inquiry report is that although the probation officer is not necessarily obliged to go into the health background of the person about whom he is reporting, such inquiries are often carried out and a lot of useful information about the person is picked up and his suitability for going to a detention centre is reported on in the social inquiry report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be aware of the disturbing reports in the "Social Worker" on 8 and 22 December last year that two boys were sent to a borstal and detention centre with serious health problems. One lad who was sent to borstal had cancer of the abdomen and the other, with a serious heart complaint, was sent to detention centre. Both boys eventually died. My hon. Friend for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) is tabling an amendment to ensure that youngsters with serious health problems are not sent to detention centres if it is possible not to send them, but one method of limiting the possibility of any youngster with a health problem—or any problem which makes him unsuitable for custody—is to make social inquiry reports obligatory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Ryman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blyth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one disputes the value of social inquiry reports, and I do not think that the hon. and learned Gentleman would seriously dispute the fact that they are widely used already without any further amendment of the law. The particular problem which he has raised—whether serious illness or bad health can be drawn to the attention of the sentencing court by a social inquiry report—would not be overcome because a social inquiry report does not profess to be any form of medical inquiry. Without full and proper medical reports the courts would not have the information which the hon. and learned Gentleman wishes to draw to their attention. The only thing that will deal with that problem is an obligation to have medical reports before sentence is passed. A social inquiry report will not deal with the medical aspects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it will not, and I have not put it forward as doing that. I suggested most cautiously that the social inquiry report can contain details about a person's health which could be of value to the court. Of course it will be covered only by a positive requirement that medical reports prepared by medical experts are put before the court. I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>88</span>
do not put this forward as a solution at all. I suggest it as an extra reason for social inquiry reports being considered as necessary and obligatory before sentence is passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the fashionable arguments against social inquiry reports is that they are bound, by their very nature, to suggest a soft and easy solution and that they are almost bound not to recommend custodial sentences. Perhaps I could put the minds of the Committee at rest on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence does not necessarily reveal that. In fact, there was an interesting report by Howard Thomas in 	<i>Justice of the Peace</i> which outlined a sample of the boys who were sent to detention centres. It revealed that one-third had a direct recommendation in the special inquiry report to be sent to a period of custodial sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any objection put forward by the Government with regard to social inquiry reports being bound to make recommendations other than a custodial sentence are not borne out by the figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Clark 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Sutton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That disclaimer does not tally with what the hon. and learned Gentleman said in his opening remarks. He said—and I wrote them down at the time because they seemed to encapsulate the attitude of the Opposition—that the principal purpose is to see that as few persons are sent into custody as possible. That is not the principle. It may be a consideration, but in all consideration of legislative matters, the protection of the public, the deterrent element in the penal system and other factors should rank equally and, in the opinion of some of us, before that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. and learned Gentleman puts this amendment before the Committee—and thinking of this kind percolates downwards to probation officers and others—would there not be an assumption that their own career structures and concepts of advancement are coloured by this role, which is essentially to interpose themselves out of a second screening, a second form of advocacy, to ensure that such people are not sent into custody?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Essentially they will find that they are saddled with a role to act as yet another barrier to the juveniles being sent into custody. There is a further intermediate Court of Appeal, as it were. These serious and important public servants, as they are in a different role, will assume that they should try to see things from the angle of the accused to try to ensure that everything is presented in the most favourable light and to give the offender yet another chance of avoiding custody.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman read my words as if I had said something enormously novel— that for the first time he had heard the idea put forward in Parliament or elsewhere that we should try to send as few young people into custody as possible. The Home Secretary is of that view, and I do not wish to put words into the mouth of the Minister of State. He can put them far better than I can. However, I should be surprised if that was not his view also.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as social workers or probation officers are concerned, they are well aware that they have to prepare a report that is as all-embracing as possible. Of course, they must take into account the need for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0184">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>89</span>
the public to be protected from dangerous criminals whether they be young criminals or older ones. Therefore, I do not think, with great respect to the hon. Gentleman, that his intervention in any way damages the argument that I am putting forward. The fact that many social inquiry reports already recommend a custodial sentence underlines that social workers and probation officers who prepare the reports have in mind the wider considerations as well as purely the interests of the person about whom they are preparing the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not just the two reports to which I have referred that have suggested that social inquiry reports should be made obligatory before a person is sentenced to custody for the first time or at all. It is certainly the view of as broadly based a body as the Women's National Commission which said it agreed that in determining the appropriate method of sentencing a person under 21 years of age, it was essential for the court to obtain social inquiry reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw that to the attention of the Minister because he will be impressed by some of the people on that Commission. They use the word " essential ". That is also the view of as broadly based a body as the National Youth Bureau. It says that a social inquiry report should be considered before any custodial sentence is made. This is the view of NACRO, NAPO and other organisations that devote so much of their time to analysing the problems posed by crime and penal policy in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that the Minister would welcome these amendments. The Home Office attach, and have attached over the years since the Children and Young Persons Act, great importance to the value of the courts considering social inquiry reports. It recommends that they should be considered. All I am doing is putting that recommendation into a statute and suggesting that it should be more binding on the courts than it has proved to be in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that everybody would have been disturbed, not least the Minister himself, about the revelations of the appalling problems at the girls' borstal, Bull-wood Hall, that were revealed yesterday. I do not want to dwell on that because you, Mr. Dean, might say that it was not directly linked with this amendment and I would not want to incur your wrath at so early a stage in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That report revealed that girls being sent to a borstal institution were not in any way benefiting from that regime, but were becoming more violent and more criminally inclined as a result, and whose violent actions were likely to have a damaging and deleterious effect upon some of the other girls of a less violent disposition who had been sent to that institution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not put forward a false point, but it is possible that some of those girls may well have been sent to that borstal institution without a social inquiry report as to their suitability having been put before the court that sent them there. If that is the case, it is an indictment of the system. I hope that the Minister will accept these amendments or a lesser amendment, or will come forward with a commitment to a lesser amendment. He is most anxious for the Bill to succeed. I am most anxious for the Bill to achieve its aim. I accept that there are some cases where a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>90</span>
social inquiry report might be next to useless and where it is so obvious a person must be sent to custody that a social inquiry report recommending any other course would be an absurdity, and frivolous in the context of the seriousness of the crime. Of course, the recommendations do not have to be carried out by the court. The expense of preparing a report that might not necessarily be of much value is not that great, and the number of cases where it would occur would not be that many. I would not have thought that as a valid objection, if indeed it is one that the Minister will put.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned whether the hon. and learned Gentleman feels that social workers are totally qualified for this new responsibility that he wishes to put upon their shoulders. Is there not a danger that, realising the fuller implications and the new importance which the report would take because of the force of law which the amendment would give that report, they might weaken some of the proposals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would have thought the opposite. I would have thought that the content of the report would have been no different from the content now. They prepare their report having fully in mind all the considerations to which I referred earlier. They would be as anxious as anybody for the Bill to succeed. If such a burden was put upon them all it would mean is that they would be preparing a few more reports than they prepare now. In the overwhelming number of cases, social inquiry reports are now asked for and considered. I would not have thought that the objections of the hon. Gentleman were valid at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not only the consideration but the implication of the report that would be of importance if the hon. Member's amendment became law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the whole purpose of the amendment. If the hon. Gentleman suggests that experienced probation officers and social workers cannot be trusted to put forward an honest report giving their honest opinion, having regard to the knowledge of the person and their responsibilities to society, one might as well not entrust them with anything. I do not believe that, in these circumstances, they would prepare a report anyway other than honestly and having regard to their obligations to society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vivian Bendall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ilford, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What concerns me is that many social workers are very young and often inexperienced of the common sense basis of life, and I think there is a danger of lack of experience and a possible tendency, as a result of that, towards leniency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What concerns me also is that many offenders are very young as well. The court does not have to accept the report. The hon. Gentleman is speaking as if the social worker or the probation officer who prepared the report is the person who is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0185">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>91</span>
sentencing. He is not. He is making a recommendation. He is drawing up a report which will be concerned with the offender's background and suitability for custodial treatment, in his view. It is ultimately up to the court to decide, as it is now, and quite rightly so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only extra thing that will be achieved by the amendment is that the court will have the advantage— which perhaps it does not have now—of the social inquiry report as well as all the other information at its disposal. That seems to me to be a minimum that a court should have before sentencing a young person to a period of custody which may well damage that person for the rest of his life. In no way do I suggest that the damage that he may have done before being brought to court is not something that we should abhor, but a period of custody can have such serious implications for a youngster, and for all those who are in contact with him later, that every possible avenue should be explored, and every possible piece of information should be given to the court, before that drastic course of action is taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will have observed that linked with the amendment moved by my hon. and learned Friend is one that stands in my name, which is shorter and does not spell out in so much detail the character of the reports which the court should be required to obtain. Which of the two is preferable in the circumstances will be a matter for argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we would all start from the agreed assumption that in any case where there is the possibility that a person under 21 might be sentenced to some form of custodial penalty it would be right that there should be before the court a social inquiry report made by a probation officer or by a social worker, in addition to any other relevant information as to his background and circumstances. Indeed, if one is dealing with a person who would be liable to detention, for whom detention might be one of the options of the court, by virtue of the provisions of clause 2 (5) 	<i>(a),</i> which brings in the suitability for detention centre having regard to his mental or physical condition, it is difficult to see how a court could possibly comply with that obligation without having such a report before it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think there is anything between us—I hope not, at any rate, despite some of the interventions in the speech of my hon. and learned Friend—as to the desirability of a report at that time being before the court. If I may follow the example of some hon. Members on both sides of the Committee and speak of my own experience as a recorder for five years— rather a long time ago now—I certainly never sentenced anyone, whether adult or juvenile, to a custodial sentence without having had a social inquiry report about him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if I took the view that the circumstances of the case were such that a custodial sentence was unavoidable, I still wanted to know about him and his background and the influences that had led him to where he was in order to determine what sort of custodial sentence I ought to impose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find some difficulty in the wording of subsection (6), which in turn reflects itself in a little difficulty about
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>92</span>
the amendment moved by my hon. and learned Friend, which in spirit I entirely support. I hope that the Minister will explain the language of the subsection. Clause 1(6) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of determining whether there is any appropriate method of dealing with a person"</p></blockquote>
—other than custodial methods—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the court shall obtain."</p></blockquote>
It is by no means certain that the court would construe that as meaning that if it is possibly minded to pass such a sentence, it should obtain and consider information. The strict meaning of the words as they stand is that in every case the court shall obtain information, and its purpose in doing so will be to determine whether there is some other appropriate method of dealing with the offender. That could certainly be clarified, although we are not at the moment considering an amendment that would clarify it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that the court, if necessary guided by higher courts, decides that this objection applies only to those cases were there is a genuine possibility that it might pass a custodial sentence. If we go on to the next part, a larger difficulty arises which I hope that the Minister will be able to set at rest. Subsection (6) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the court shall obtain and consider information about the circumstances, and shall take into account any information before the court which is relevant to his character and his physical and mental condition."</p></blockquote>
It is that difference in wording that I find difficult to follow. There is an obligation on the court to
	<br><blockquote><p>"obtain and consider information about the circumstances",</p></blockquote>
but when we come to the last part which refers to material relevant to the character and physical and mental condition of the offender, the requirement on the court is not to " obtain " that material but to
	<br><blockquote><p>"take into account any information before the court."</p></blockquote>
Why this difference is made between what the court is required to obtain for itself and what it is required to have regard to is something that I do not follow. I hope that the Minister will explain the difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is because of that difference in terminology that I thought it desirable that there should be inserted into the clause something to explain the word " circumstances ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment is very short and would insert after " circumstances " the same words that appear in clause 2 (6) where " circumstances ", admittedly " special" circumstances are referred to, whether relating to the offence or the offender. That would make it quite clear, as subsection (6) does, that the relevant circumstances are both those of the offence and those of the offender. The wording that I propose should be inserted into the subsection after "circumstances"
	<br><blockquote><p>"of the offence and the offender"</p></blockquote>
would make it quite clear that it is the duty of the court, given the premise to the subsection, itself to obtain and consider information about the circumstances both of the offence and of the offender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be said that that is unnecessary and that it is obvious already from the mere use of " circumstances ". If so, one wonders why the Government put it into clause 2 (6) unless they did so because of the use of the word " special" in that subsection.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0186">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>93</span>
However, in this subsection the information that the court is required to take into account is subject to a specific limitation, or description. It is information that is relevant to the character and physical and mental condition of the defendant. From the way that is phrased, it may be thought that the expression " circumstances " refers only to the circumstances of the offence. In other words, there is a duty on the court to obtain and consider information about the circumstances of the offence, but not of the offender. It must then take into account information relevant to the offender's character, physical and mental condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see that the court might construe the subsection in that way and regard its own duty of obtaining and considering information limited to obtaining information about the circumstances of the offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find the whole arrangement of this subsection somewhat puzzling. However, if there is any danger at all that the court would construe its function as being limited in that way, it seems to me that that ought to be put at rest and it could be put at rest by the insertion of the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"of the offence and the offender".</p></blockquote>
There would be a positive duty on the court, whenever it was minded to think about the custodial penalty in the case of a person under 21 years of age, to obtain and consider information about the circumstances, not only of the offence, which would no doubt be before it in any event, but also of the offender. The subsection would continue quite logically with the provision that it is to take into account information on character which is set out in the subsection as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Admittedly, a short amendment of that kind would not go as far as has been suggested by my hon. and learned Friend's amendment, because it would not specify precisely the type of information about the offender which it would be an obligation upon the court to obtain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before making up my own mind about whether the wording of my hon. and learned Friend's amendment is necessary, I would like to hear what the Minister has to say about that, as other forms of information apart from those mentioned in the amendment, would in many cases be helpful. There is perhaps a danger— the sort of danger that the Minister referred to in relation to the last series of amendments—that by specifying these social inquiry reports, whether made by a probation officer or social worker, one might appear to rule out other types of information which would be relevant to the circumstances of the offender and which ought to be before the court. I certainly have no objection to including in the information that the court should obtain a social inquiry report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that we should not exclude other useful material by what we put into this particular subsection. While I sympathise very much with the spirit of my hon. and learned Friend's amendment— and I gather he was suggesting that, given a satisfactory reply from the Minister, he would be content to accept other wording—I await the explanation from the Minister of the wording as it now stands. I hope that he will look with sympathy on the way in which I have put the matter so as to make this subsection that much clearer than it appears, to me at any rate, at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support what I think we would all accept is a perfectly reasonable attempt by my hon. Friends to require courts to consider a social inquiry report before passing a custodial sentence. As my hon. and learned Friend pointed out in moving the amendment, a custodial sentence is extremely disruptive upon any individual, but certainly upon a young offender. It disrupts whatever employment opportunities he or she may have at that particular time, or training or educational courses in which they are engaged. It is an important and crucial period of their life, a period which they will not have again and the disadvantage of which they may not be able to overcome in the future. It damages their family relationships, which may be bad anyway but which will in no way be helped by the imposition of a custodial sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Putting a youngster into an institution exposes him to characters who are more criminal and sophisticated than he and to influences within institutions such as Bullwood Hall, which has already been referred to in our proceedings, that are totally different and far more pernicious than the influences to which they are subjected perhaps in their home environment. Most important of all, the problems of a young person are related to the social context in which they must live and work. That is where their problems have their origins, where they have their roots and where, eventually, they have to be resolved and overcome. They are not overcome by putting them into the unnatural closed, single-sex world of a penal institution. Therefore, before passing any custodial sentence that might decrease rather than increase the chances of a young offender leading a law-abiding and constructive life, I believe, like my hon. and learned Friend, that the least the court can do is to consider fully the circumstances and background of that particular offender and, indeed, of the offence which he committed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a perfectly moderate, sensible course of action. Before imposing a custodial sentence, which is important in terms of the deprivation of an individual's liberty, but which also has the unfortunate disadvantages and consequences that have been pointed out in several contributions to the earlier debate, the court should have full information before it of the circumstances and the background of the offender.

Indeed, the Home Office research report No. 48 " Social Inquiry Reports, A Survey " published in 1979 describes the results of a sentencing exercise carried out on a sample of magistrates. This examines the factors, reasons and considerations that magistrates took into account before passing sentences. It assessed the type of information that magistrates most frequently used in determining the kind of custodial or non-custodial sentence that they would impose. This report identified 21 different types of information, ranked in order of priority according to the magistrates' own determination. These included such things as the offence, the previous convictions of the offender and the attitude of the offender to the offence, as well as more obvious things to which my hon. and learned Friend has referred, such as family background, employment opportunities and prospects,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0187">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>95</span>
involvement in drink or drugs, his family relationships, education, accommodation facilities and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the items, which the magistrates on the evidence of that research considered to be important in helping them to make up their minds as to whether or not to pass a custodial sentence, will be known to the court in the police antecedents of the offender, but most of them would not be available, unless a social inquiry report was compiled by a trained professional probation officer or social worker.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If magistrates, on the basis of the evidence of this survey conducted by the Home Office, regard it as important to have that information before they are prepared to determine whether the sentence should be one of custody or a non-custodial alternative, clearly it would also seem to be important and reasonable that we should require the courts to have that information before them as a matter of course before passing a custodial sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an aside, I think it somewhat remarkable that on every occasion Opposition Members propose measures that give a responsibility or a duty to social workers or probation officers, Conservative Members are quick to jump to their feet to ridicule, condemn and criticise social workers and probation officers. I do not know why they should have the singularly dim view, that they all seem to possess, of social workers and probation officers. This is certainly characteristic of all the interventions that have been made so far. I do not share the view of the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendall) that probation officers and social workers are inappropriate persons to give guidance to a court on the disposal of a particular offender. Clearly, the courts do not take that view, because one of the most important factors that they take into account in determining their disposal is a recommendation by a social worker or a probation officer. So those at the sharp end, involved on a day-to-day basis in dealing with offenders, seem to have a much higher regard for the social workers and probation officers than Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bendall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I used the words " often young and therefore, inexperienced ".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but it is the tone that the hon. Member and his learned Friends use, constantly and repeatedly. We know what he meant. The amendments, if accepted by the Government, will have implications for the probation service. The probation service will need far stronger backing and support from the Government than it has received so far. There would be no objection from the probation service to the extra responsibilities imposed upon them consequent upon the passing of this amendment. Indeed, in the comments on the last Government's Green Paper "Youth Custody and Supervision: A New Sentence " published in 1978, the conference of chief probation officers expressed its agreement with the proposal that courts should consider a social inquiry report before passing a custodial sentence on a young offender. It added:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We would also wish to require such a report to be considered before committal to the Crown Court for sentence, as we feel that only after full consideration of all the background factors can the lower court really reach a conclusion that their powers of sentence are inadequate."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>96</span>
The conference reaffirmed that view much more recently in its comments on the present Government's White Paper entitled "Young Offenders". Indeed, the National Association of Probation Officers has expressed precisely the same view. Therefore, there cannot be any substantial or valid reason for the Government refusing to accept this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the arguments deployed in this debate by both my hon. Friends and myself apply with equal force and with validity to adults, especially to those confronted with the prospects of a first custodial sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recognition of that, the Parliamentary All-party Penal Affairs Group has tabled a new clause to the Bill requiring that there be a consideration of a social inquiry report before a first custodial sentence is imposed upon an offender of any age. That, just as are the amendments being considered, seems to be an eminently sensible, moderate and reasonable proposal to which no one with knowledge of this matter could reasonably object. On that basis, therefore, I hope the Minister of State will feel able to make a conciliatory gesture and accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with the spirit of the amendment, and agree substantially with what the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) has said. In fact, my name is attached to the new clause to which he referred, relating to the need for a probation order before sentencing. Having said that, it is impossible to support the official Opposition amendment because it deletes—as a precursor to introducing the need to consider a probation order—any obligation to consider the circumstances of the offence. I simply do not understand why that is included. It is quite clear that the circumstances of the offence have to be considered as well as the circumstances of the offender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, if there is a difference between a premeditated offence and an offence on the spur of the moment, my support would go to the amendment put down by the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) which does not have the effect of deleting essential parts of what is intended by subsection (6).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having looked at subsection (6) I share the doubts of the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich about its drafting. According to the subsection as drawn at present, there is an obligation to
	<br><blockquote><p>"consider information about the circumstances."</p></blockquote>
The words "the circumstances" are defined—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obtain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyons</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am referring for the moment simply to the word "consider". The court is also required to "take into account" information relevant to the character and physical and mental condition of the person before the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one looks at the difference between the word "consider" and the words "take into account", the inference is that the court must not take into account information about the circumstances. It can only consider them but can take into account other information.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>97</span>
I should like to know what difference the Minister sees between the word "consider" in one context and the words "take into account" in amother context. There seems to be a difference in weight to be attached to those two formulations. My view is that the court should be entitled to take into account the circumstances of the offence. It is an important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If "consider" is somehow meant to imply a lesser duty of consideration or care than "take into account", that is unfortunate, to say the least. Perhaps the Minister will explain the difference for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the hon. and learned Gentleman is dealing only with the parallelism between "consider" and "take into account". A greater difficulty is that there seems to be placed on the court in the first part the positive duty to obtain that information, whereas in the second part all that is required to do is to take into account any information that may happen to be before the court. It seems to be very a odd way of putting it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyons</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have sympathy with the view of the right hon. and learned Gentleman, which is why 1 am supporting his amendment which seeks to ensure that the court will be obliged to obtain and consider information not only about the circumstances of the offence but also about the circumstances of the offender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are circumstances of the offender which may not be covered by the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"relevant to his character and his physical and mental condition."</p></blockquote>
That in itself can be a limitation. It is another advantage of the wider wording of the amendment moved by the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich, without the need in the amendment to delete the words about character and physical and mental condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How does the Minister account for the drafting of subsection (6) and the difference in wording? The official Opposition might decide to withdraw their defective amendment and support the amendment of the right hon. and learned Minister for Dulwich, and to reply on the new clause which will come later in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Dubs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I briefly support the amendments. If a young person is under the age of 17 he will, as I understand it, go before a juvenile bureau. Although in the juvenile bureau there is not the inevitability of a social inquiry report, it is usual. Indeed, it would be quite exceptional if there were not to be a social inquiry report in the case of a young person under the age of 17 who gets into trouble, but as soon as a young person reaches his seventeenth birthday the situation changes. The individual may be before a court that will have very little information about the background circumstances of the young person; especially as he may well plead guilty and the magistrates in practice all too often do not feel that they should inquire further into the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that this also relates to legal representation, which is the subject of a later amendment. Nevertheless, I find it difficult to understand why
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>98</span>
Conservative Members should query reports from social workers or probation officers when their purpose is simply to ensure that the magistrate or judge is as well informed as possible about the background circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give an example. It might be that a young person gets into difficulties and commits an offence. Since committing the offence but before coming before the court, he might have taken positive steps to improve his lifestyle. Since then the young person may have found a job, have gone to college, or ceased to be a truant from school. I should have thought that it would be relevant to the attitude of the court if the young person has more recently taken the necessary steps to put his or her life into order and is showing evidence that the circumstances that caused the offence are unlikely to arise again. I should have thought that is precisely the sort of information which, if the magistrate or judge were to have it, presumably through a social inquiry report, he would take into account and that it would influence the type of sentence that a magistrate or judge would wish to impose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see that these amendments do other than provide a useful and essential safeguard that will prevent some young people from getting sentences that are inappropriate and help to keep some young people from getting into trouble, when the evidence is that they would not get into any further trouble after that event.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with great interest to the debate, which I have found helpful. I do not believe that anyone on the Government side questions the value of reports prepared on the circumstances of an offender, and in particular on the circumstances of an offender in the context of the offence for which he falls to be sentenced. These have long been regarded as valuable by the courts. They are prepared either by probation officers or, in the case of juveniles, also by social workers. I think one starts from that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is whether, in the case of the first amendment moved by the hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson), we are going to write into the existing statutory obligation the specific source of information represented by the social inquiry report. We ought to approach this in the knowledge that in the vast majority of cases where a custodial sentence is imposed, whether on a juvenile or on a young adult, the court has the benefit of a social inquiry report and takes it into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perfectly true to say that one does not have to have one by statute, save where one is minded to impose a community service order. The 1973 Act says that one has to have a report from a probation officer and has to consider it, although it is not described as a social inquiry report. The interesting thing is that in the 1973 Act, Parliament took the view that there might be circumstances in which it would be right for an obligation to be imposed on a court to take a social inquiry report into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is to be found in section 45 of the Act, but never implemented, curiously enough. That section gives power to the Home Secretary to promulgate rules
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0189">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>99</span>
that would require, in certain circumstances, a court to take account of that. It has never been implemented. I think the reason is that successive Home Secretaries in successive Governments have preferred, by circular, to make recommendations that courts ought to take into account social inquiry reports, and to influence by recommendation the form which social inquiry reports should take. Certainly the courts themselves attached the highest importance to this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see, in Mr. Thomas's book on sentencing, that in the past the courts certainly have criticised custodial sentences that have been imposed where a social inquiry report has not been taken into account, but the real question is whether one must take a social inquiry report into account. There are certain difficulties there, but I will say straight away that I and the Government are certainly prepared to consider this brace of amendments and to consult about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone will understand that it is sensible to consult about these matters before coming to a firm conclusion. I am much more attracted to the second of these-amendments, proposed by the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich, because it makes plain to the courts the nature of the information that Parliament wants them to obtain, without tying them down and making a specific example of the social inquiry report. The hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West made a cogent point about the danger of doing that, as have one or two other hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the constructive points made by the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich. I entirely follow the argument and the doubts that he expressed. All that I would say is that this particular formula which he has subjected to this testing and accurate analysis is one that has been unchanged since the Criminal Justice Act 1948. Nobody who advises me is aware of any case in which it has given rise to the slightest difficulty, which is quite a good reason for leaving it untouched.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will consider the points, but the reality of the situation is that the court recognises that as the first limb of this formula there is the duty to obtain and consider information about the circumstances. That is the mandatory obligation—" shall obtain "—to which he drew attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are those circumstances? They always include, and must include, the circumstances of the offender in the context of the offence for which he falls to be sentenced. If one is determined to find every corner of the park beset by tigers, one can see a difficulty, but fortunately it is not one which has, so I am advised, given rise to the slightest difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. and learned Gentleman went on to say that thereafter it shall only take into account any information before the court which is relevant to his character. He rightly made the point that there is not there imposed a statutory obligtation to go out and get all the information relevant to his character and his physical and mental condition. That is the law and that is the right interpretation, if I might respectfully say so, of the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although no difficulty has arisen in the past, and although it is virtually the universal practice of all courts—particularly the Crown courts where one has the benefit of representation by a solicitor or counsel— to satisfy themselves that they have the relevant
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>100</span>
information both about the offender and of the offence, I can see the argument which leads the right hon. and learned Gentleman for Dulwich to put forward his version. May I leave it like that? I understand the point and acknowledge the value of the courts being properly informed by means of reports of one kind and another as to the circumstances of the offender and the offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should like to consult about this. We see greater attraction in the second rather than in the first of these amendments. If I have said enough to enable Opposition Members to understand the Government's approach to these amendments, and to feel that they can withdraw them, I believe that would be the most satisfactory course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has certainly done enough to satisfy me that there are possibly greater attractions in the amendment put forward by my hon. and learned Friend for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) than in the amendment which, with the best of intentions, I put forward. It is certainly not my intention, or that of any of my hon. Friends in putting forward this amendment, that circumstances about the offence should not be put before the court, Of course, they should be considered and the hon. and learned Gentleman is perfectly right to draw that to the attention of the Committee. If that were to be the case, quite clearly the concept behind the amendment that every possible bit of information should be revealed to the court before somebody is sentenced, would be defeated. I can see that in those circumstances there may well be an imperfection in these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me comment on one point made by the hon. Gentleman for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendall). He spoke about the possible dangers of a report drawn up by an inexperienced social worker. I do not think that that was an inappropriate remark for him to make. I do not see that there is any reason why we should regard everything a social worker says, however inexperienced he may be, as sacrosanct and always right. The view, however, of the Association of Directors of Social Services—this might help the hon. Gentleman—is that social inquiry reports should be prepared by experienced social workers. If it is necessary, for whatever reason, to require an inexperienced social worker to complete a social inquiry report, the report should be vetted by an experienced, senior worker or court worker and that any recommendations made should be substantiated by the evidence collected and contained in the report. I think, therefore, that his intervention was in some ways helpful because it has enabled me to give him that reassurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some Conservative Members were doubtful about the relationship between the magistrate, the court and the social workers and that possibly there was a suspicion by magistrates about the value of social inquiry reports. I am assured that there are frequent meetings between magistrates and those who represent the local authorities in juvenile courts and that they constantly review the standard of the social inquiry reports. I am not suggesting that the standard of social inquiry reports cannot be improved upon. There are constant attempts to improve upon them. Perhaps that will reassure the hon. Gentleman.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>101</span>
Having said that, I am grateful to the Minister for his helpful reassurance. He is quite right to have the maximum consultations possible about this matter. In those circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of this amendment is that where any court, not only magistrates' courts, makes a detention centre order, a youth custody order, or an order to detain a young person for default or contempt, it shall state the reason for its opinion that no other method of dealing with that person is appropriate and cause that reason to be specified in the warrant of commitment and to be entered in the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1(4) recognises that it is important that when a young person is convicted the court may not make any of these orders unless it is of the opinion that no other method of dealing with the offender is appropriate. The Bill also recognises the importance of the reason for the opinion being given in subsection (7), but it only recognises the importance of the reason being given in the case of a magistrates' court and no other court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The importance of the reason being given is that it would concentrate the mind of the court, if the court is obliged publicly to state its reason or reasons, rather than simply giving its reason to itself in its own mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it is important that the offender and the public generally—the legal advisers, and the public outside—should know the reasons. Perhaps it would have a deterrent effect on other possible young offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the Government recognises the importance of the reasons being given. I do not have to persuade the Government of that because it is in their Bill. It is now being used in connection with the Bail Act, and I should like to know the practical difficulties why these reasons may be given only in magistrates' courts and not in any other court.

Clause 1(5) provides that custodial sentences shall not be passed on persons under 21 unless the court is of the opinion that no other method of dealing with them is appropriate. That has been written into the law for a very long time. In the Crown court a complete record is kept of everything said by the presiding judge and, indeed, there is a shorthand note of everything that is said in court. The first thing the Court of Appeal looks at when a case goes to appeal is what the learned judge said in sentencing the offender. Therefore, it is the invariable practice of the judges,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>102</span>
in my experience, to explain why, if they are sentencing someone under 21 to a custodial sentence, they find it necessary to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Were a judge to fail to do so, it would certainly be a subject of comment in th Court of Appeal. The magistrates' court is quite a different case. It is not a court of record. What is said is not recorded unless the law prescribes that it shall be recorded. There is not a permanent shorthand note kept of what takes place. Therefore, it is absolutely right that subsection (7) should provide that where a magistrates' court makes orders of the kind provided for in the case of a person under 21, it shall state the reason for its opinion that no other method of dealing with the offender is appropriate and oause that reason to be specified in the warrant of commitment and to be entered in the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is utterly unnecessary in the case of the Crown court. It is there on the record. If the judge does not do it, he has failed in one of his duties which is already provided for in clause 1. Indeed, it would make a nonsense of the clause. I speak subject to correction, but there is no register. Where it is to be entered, in which register, and who keeps this register? It is not necessary. It is already there in the record of the court. If the judge has not said it, he will be subject to correction when the matter goes to appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

What register is referred to if one omits the words "magistrates'" court? It is there on the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has said, correctly by and large, that in the Crown court it would be a rarity indeed for someone not to be represented by counsel. That does not necessarily mean that he would obtain legal aid in the Court of Appeal. That is a totally different matter. Why should one, therefore, have the expense and difficulty of appearing in the Court of Appeal if the judge has erred, when it could be written into the statute and made so much easier?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But that is a false point. First of all, I do not know of such a case in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My experience goes back before legal aid when one did find youngsters appearing in the Crown court without representation. It does not happen now. If the learned judge were so to fail in his duty as not to say why he was doing it—and it is prescribed by law that he must—the first thing that his advisers would say is that he must go to appeal. With the best will in the world, the hon. Lady seeks to do something that is unnecessary. She seeks to ignore the safeguards in the Crown court and to equate the practice with that of the magistrates' court where it is completely different, and where what is proposed in subsection (7) is absolutely right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment does not allow me to be as conciliatory as I was about the previous amendment. It is not that my funds of conciliation have dried up, but I have to apply them with discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two points. The restraint upon the power to imprison a young offender as expressed by the formula in the Bill goes back in an unbroken chain to the 1948 Act. Similarly, the obligation upon a magistrates' court to state the reasons why it believes that no non-custodial sentence would be appropriate goes back to 1948, as does the obligation upon the magistrates' court to record it in the register. Similarly, the exemption upon the High court to do this goes back to 1948. The High court judges and the Assize courts have never had to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must be accurate about this because in 1948, Quarter Sessions did have to state their reasons and record it. The reason was that Quarter Sessions in those days could have non-legally qualified chairmen, and often did. It was because Parliament thought that it would be a helpful reminder to lay justices that they should not sentence to custody a young offender unless they were satisfied, and were of the opinion, that no non-custodial sentence was appropriate that this provision appeared in the Criminal Justice Act 1948.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The obligation to state the reasons is an insurance provided by Parliament that lay justices would not slip up. This is in no way to disparage lay justices. Their great strength—and here I shall have the wholehearted approval of the Committee—is that they are not lawyers. I yield to nobody in my admiration of the way that the lay justices do their job, but they are not personally trained in the law. Therefore successive Governments have thought it a good thing for them to have this reminder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not true of the Crown courts which have superseded the Quarter Sessions, to the great regret of some of us. It is not true of the High court judges because there a trained lawyer is chairman or the presiding judge. Therefore, that argument for extending the obligation to the Crown court fails. It is not there. There is that distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is the point raised by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve), who has enormous experience in these matters, that in practice the Crown courts invariably say why it is not possible to avoid sending a young offender to prison. That is his experience and I think it is really the experience of all of us. But there is no statutory obligation upon the Crown court judge to state his reasons, though he invariably does, and there is this distinction that everything that is said in the Crown court is recorded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quite see that Parliament was wise to consider what the position would be if somebody wanted to appeal from the magistrates' court. What was said? Was a reason given? The provision that goes back to 1948 was designed to assist in that consideration. At least there would be no doubt—when one goes to the Crown court on appeal against one's sentence— that the magistrates did address their minds to this particular restraint imposed by Parliament because it is written out in the register. Without that entry in the register there would be no means of knowing for sure what they said because no transcript is taken. That does not apply in the Crown courts. A transcript is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>104</span>
taken and there is no question as to what was said or what was not said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I come to what I must confess to be rather a strong bias affecting my own approach to this and similar amendments. Where a legislative provision or formula goes back in an unbroken chain for 33 years, which has not occasioned any difficulty or trouble, I have a pretty strong bias for leaving things as they are. I feel that in this instance it is not a bad approach to legislation to say that unless there is a reason for changing it, let us leave things as they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we all suffer from in this House, and we often say this in respect of other people's legislation, is that there is much too much of it. It is not too bad an approach. I do not apologise for it. In fact, I rather boast of it. Where the statute book has proved to be sensible and satisfactory and has not given rise to trouble, any change is likely to be open to the criticism that it is only change for change's sake. Therefore, much as I would like to ease the progress of the Committee by being able to say we will agree on this, I am quite satisfied that it is my duty to advise my hon. Friends not to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not going to intervene, because I had a similar amendment tabled to clause 4 about reasons in open court. I rather hoped that the Minister would concede the point to my hon. Friend. If it is right, as the hon. and learned Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve) says, that it is unnecessary because the Crown court does it, why do we not allow ourselves to write it into the legislation? It clearly would not have any adverse effect. The failure to do so in relation to higher courts since 1948 has had adverse effects in the sense that higher courts have sent people to prison before they have applied their minds to the criteria included in this clause. It would be salutary advice to them, as well as to the magistrates, to consider whether there were not non-custodial sentences in every case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. and learned Member for Solihull that it is unusual for a Crown court judge or a High Court judge to sentence without giving some reason for the sentence, but that does not mean to say that he has applied his mind to the question of whether a non-custodial sentence is available. Quite frequently he applies his mind to the length of sentence and gives his reasons for indicating length of sentence, rather than to considering whether an alternative non-custodial sentence is available. His reasoning is often directed to the length of the sentence rather than to the nature of the sentence. It would be desirable if we put this in for the higher courts and I hope that my hon. Friend will persist with this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not propose to take up more than a minute or two on this matter. I rise only because of the heavy emphasis which the Minister placed on the general practice which appeals to him of, as it were, letting sleeping clauses lie. I sympathise with that point of view, but I hope that he will not take it too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sometimes to say that no difficulty has arisen means that no difficulty appears to have arisen and one does
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0192">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>105</span>
not always know what has affected the mind of a court in reaching particular conclusions. Generally speaking, what the Minister says is fair enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I wonder whether the Minister has applied his mind in that context to the fact that the Bill is making considerable changes in how people will be dealt with and a major change is the reduction to 21 days—in some circumstances, less than that—in the minimum period for which a person can be sent to a detention centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in relation to such cases, where there is the possibility of an extremely short sentence of detention, as against a non-custodial sentence, that there may often be a difficulty and dilemma which has not existed up to now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Up to now the possibility of the very short sentence has not arisen and generally, though it may have been open in the case of imprisonment, it was not enshrined in legislation as something to be encouraged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That difficulty will affect all the courts—not only the magistrates' court, but the higher courts as well. I wonder, therefore, whether the Minister has considered that difficulty and whether, in the light of it, he may want to reconsider his reliance on long-established precedents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that 1 may have the indulgence of the Committee to reply to the cogent points made by the right hon. and learned Gentleman. He is saying that, for the first time, the courts will be able to send a young offender to a detention centre for as little as three weeks and he wonders whether there is a danger that it may be thought that a taste of prison will do the young offender good in circumstances where it would be appropriate to make a non-custodial order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the courts had the reminder that there were statutory restraints on sending someone to custody, even for so short a period as three weeks, it would be a good thing. I understand the way the right hon. and learned Gentleman puts it, but I believe that the courts will be well aware of the restraints. I believe that there will be other opportunities taken, before the Bill receives Royal Assent, to emphasise yet again that no custodial sentence should be given, however short, unless it is inappropriate to deal with the offender by some non-custodial means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have spoken already about the training seminars and the Judicial Studies Board. I know very well— and we shall be dealing with this again in relation to clause 25 which deals with partially suspended sentences—of the concern that is felt by the higher judiciary that this sentence shall not be misapplied and I am certain that the judiciary will be fully informed at all levels, whether magistrates' or Crown courts, of the importance of not using the new custodial sentences or new variants of existing custodial sentences in cases in which they would not otherwise have given a custodial sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I understand the points made by the right hon. and learned Gentleman, they do not persuade me that we ought to deal with the matter by acceding to the amendment. The danger to which he drew attention has been overstated and can be dealt with by other means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>106</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the support for the amendment which I have had from my right hon. and learned Friends. I should have liked to have as a member of the Committee, Lord Justice Waller, who is highly thought of by the legal profession. He was a member of the Advisory Council on the Penal System which drew up the document "Young Adult Offenders". Incidentally, on that advisory council there was more than one senior member of the judiciary. They came to the conclusion that they could see no reason why the Crown courts should not be required to give reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know the Minister is selective in this acceptance or otherwise of the recommendations of the Advisory Council on the Penal System. He has now disbanded it, so he is in no quandary as to what to select or not to select, but I know that on Second Reading when it suited him he called in aid the advisory council, but on many matters he has rejected their advice. Certainly Lord Justice Waller's views should not be lightly dismissed by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point made for not accepting the amendment was that the higher courts already give reasons, but that was then changed to "invariably give reasons", so it is not certain that they will give reasons. There is no statutory obligation for them to do so, and it could be that they do not give reasons. That is what the amendment seeks to ensure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is that if they do not give reasons, somebody could be sent to prison while waiting for their appeal to be heard. All the spirit behind the Bill of trying to keep people out of prison could be destroyed while somebody waits in prison for his appeal to be heard and it is then found that the judge was incorrect in not having given reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that we should accept the undertakings and assurances that this is being done anyway and that the courts realise that this is expected of them. If it is right to put it in for the magistrates' courts, it would seem right to put it in for all courts and to put them under a statutory obligation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
