	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 20 is simply a revision of the statutory arrangements whereby the local authority funds intermediate treatment. I hope that the Chair will not regard it as being out of order if we use the opportunity to urge a rather wider use of intermediate treatment to encourage local authorities to be more generous and the Government to be more generous to the local authorities in relation to intermediate treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the latest figures that I have—they may be corrected by the Minister—in 1978, when the last count of intermediate treatment was carried out, about 20,600 young people were the subject of supervision orders and about 12,500 of that total were undergoing intermediate treatment. As the Minister indicated, for last year for the whole of England and Wales about £6¼ million was spent on roughly 12,000 children. The number of children in borstal is about 6,500 and that cost the taxpayer something approaching £50 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a fair estimate of the balance between dealing with youthful offending in a closed security and dealing with youthful offending in circumstances where the child can live at home and can still maintain his links with his local background but might be encouraged to adopt a different attitude towards his life and crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I do not know the recidivist figures for intermediate treatment, I suspect that they are a good deal better than for borstals. It therefore raises in a very simple way the issue that is now becoming live in our society. It is this on which I want to dwell for a few minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to illustrate it, let me read from a letter of some length that came to me last week from a teacher in borstal who gives his name and address —which I do not intend to repeat but which I intend to send to the Minister. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>" I have been a teacher in a closed borstal for almost four years. Previous to this I was a voluntary youth leader for some seven years working with delinquent and often disturbed young persons. It would be hard for anyone to accuse me of being an idealist with that type of background. In the borstal that I teach in I am aware that many of the trainees of the establishment, together
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>310</span>
with others in similar institutions, will form the bulk of the prison population of the future. Yet the majority of them are a long way from being bad or wicked. Of the youngsters that I come into contact with, within the borstal, some 75% should not be in custody at all. The other 25%, I submit, are nasty vicious thugs who must be detained for the good and protection of society. I will deal with this group first.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"These thugs will never learn no matter what punishment is meted out to them and so calls for corporal punishment are of little use. Imprisonment certainly means nothing to them. Yet it is from this 25% that individuals emerge who do, in no small measure, control the lives of all those who are confined in, or work in, penal institutions. Most governors will confirm that. These are the bully boys who offer protection in return for goods or favours and the tobacco barons … My concern is not with these but with that vast majority of youngsters who can so easily be led or misused by these thugs and learn from them that it pays to be tough or ' hard' as they would have it."</p></blockquote>
The letter goes on to instance a number of these children. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Paul was a youngster of 15 when he first came on to one of my classes. He had been in care from a very early age. He had passed from one custodial sentence which in many cases ' care' is, to another. Along the way he had been to what he called approved school, detention centre, remand centre, prisons. There can be little doubt that Paul is going to spend most of his life in penal institutions. I have watched him change from a carefree young person into someone who blindly imitates the mindless thugs. He has made himself become hard. I did all I could to help Paul, for I could plainly see that he was allowing himself to be trapped, but what I could do was not enough …</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Gary is a young person who is on my classes at the moment. He is full of zest and fun and any normal parents would be proud to call him their son. Yet Gary's parents have not visited him for the last three years. They do not want to see him nor do they want him when he leaves the borstal in a few weeks time. They will not even write him a letter. From what he has told me Gary's father simply wanted his son as an unpaid servant, and when Gary rebelled he was thrown out. Gary has nowhere to go when he leaves the borstal. He will be offered hostel accommodation. But most young offenders see an hostel merely as an extension of their sentence. However, Gary may have no choice. He is homeless. He has no means of supporting himself. He will, probably, be friendless in a strange area and most borstal boys are very ethnocentric. He will, almost certainly, offend again within a short time of being released. I have told him that I will meet him when he is released and I will go with him to look for employment. He has all but told me that it would be a waste of time.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Jimmy was a youngster of brilliant intellect. His I.Q. was certainly much, much higher than my own. Yet life in an institution is, for him, more preferable to life outside of one. How, in the name of all that is decent and civilised, can a society justify this kind of situation. Jimmy had been sold short all his life and he knew it. I was able to form a very good relationship with him during his time on my class. However, when he left the borstal, because of distance, I lost touch with him. I learned that within weeks of leaving the borstal he was arrested and sentenced to three years imprisonment Yet Jimmy would have been far more suited to a university campus than to a prison. He had rejected, so he said, society completely. Several times I asked him why and his answer was always the same: ' No one cares about me or the way that I feel; therefore I have no concern for anyone else.' I was never able to accept that answer when he gave it. I do now."</p></blockquote>
This letter is typical of the wide experience of anyone who has had to deal with juvenile offenders. It is deplorable to go on arguing that we are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0309">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>311</span>
dealing with a rising crime wave by serious offenders who have to be dealt with by custodial sentencing, and that that is the only way to be tough about crime in our society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make this appeal partly in relation to the new clause, because I think it would be better if we spent more of that £50 million on widening intermediate treatment in order to keep more children out of custody, even if we are going over from borstal to youth custody. I also make it partly— and this debate is particularly opportune—because a real movement is taking place in the higher realms of the police force to counter the trend that has developed over the last few months to try to establish shorter sentencing and more effective means of policing that did not call for the heavy hand which has been demonstrated in the past. It is perfectly clear from the recent statement of the Chief Constable of Kent, as the chairman of the Association of Chief Police Officers, and from a number of other leaks that have been made recently, that the police are fighting back of their own volition against the policy which has been adumbrated by the Home Secretary arguing for shorter sentencing and for a different kind of policing operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is allowed to continue—and I ought to say that they are financed by public money in their public relations exercise—an alternative political philosophy will be put across by police officers who are accountable to no one. The real problem at the moment in relation to policing is that police have become divorced from the community. We desperately need to get them back under the control of the community and to reassert the power of police authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In so far as there is any control at the moment, it comes from the Home Secretary. If the Home Secretary is being attacked at a moment when he is vulnerable from his own Back Benches, by police officers who are only paid officials and who are not representatives of penal policy, that would be a serious setback to the campaign behind which the Home Secretary has put his weight, and to which the Minister has referred on a number of occasions in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason I make this point is that I reject completely the police suggestion that shorter sentencing, or more community policing, are soft options which are taken simply in order to save money at a time of reduced national resources. That is totally untrue. Shorter sentencing and more effective community policing are better ways of doing the job that the community wants—of dealing with crime effectively in order to reduce the incidence of crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it were possible to take the money from borstal, or now from youth custody, and to put a greater amount into intermediate treatment, children could be prevented from committing crimes in a more effective way than they will be by simply enlarging the scope of youth custody. If there was more community policing of the kind that took place in Handsworth, that would not mean that serious crime would increase. What happened in Handsworth was
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>312</span>
that mugging was reduced by half. Where serious community policing has taken place that has always been the experience. What the police—and the community at large, particularly the 	<i>Daily Express</i> and the 	<i>Sunday Express</i>—must get into their heads is that we are urging not softer but more effective, treatment of criminals so as to reduce the incidence of crime. That must be said perfectly clearly and loudly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will say it perfectly clearly and loudly, because at the moment I detect that the police are coming back against Scarman, against the incidents of last year and against the appeals for shorter sentencing, in order to dictate the policy of treatment of the offender which has been used in the past and which has proved ineffective. We are now arguing for a more effective way of dealing with crime than we have had in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that is simply a matter of saving money, but I think we could actually save some money if we were to operate more effectively. Therefore, I appeal to the Minister, not only that he should reject the suggestions that have come from Mr. Pain but also that he should look at the amount of money allocated to intermediate treatment as against borstal training. If we could make intermediate treatment a real option for the courts, to be used much more widely, and if we could give local authorities enough money to provide effective methods of intermediate treatment, I am sure that this would prove to be a real advance in dealing with juvenile delinquency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr, Robert Kilroy-Silk 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Ormskirk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 20 imposes a requirement on local authorities to make provision for intermediate treatment schemes that can be used by courts in conjunction with a supervision order. Unfortunately, however, the present position of intermediate treatment schemes is extremely patchy and the present distribution was very succinctly put by the former Under-Secretary of State, Health and Social Security, the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young), when he spoke to the Leicester Action for Youth Trust on 12 February 1981 and said:
	<br><blockquote><p>" At present the development of I.T. is too patchy. Some areas can boast a wide range of activities provided from a variety of sources; in others, almost no facilities are available. Everywhere, I.T. at the ' heavier' end—that is for youngsters convicted of more than just petty crimes and beyond the reach of many of the programmes— is very sparsely available."</p></blockquote>

Indeed, in 1981 the total expenditure on intermediate treatment by local authorities was no more than £7 million, and yet, at the same time, approximately £85 million was spent on community homes with education and on local authority observation and assessment centres. That clearly demonstrates the present lopsided priority we have in this country and that we have had ever since and before the 1969 Children and Young Persons Act. Despite all the rhetoric of a variety of organisations, institutions, individuals and Governments that we should shift the emphasis away from custodial care and custodial sentences to treatment in the community, here we are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0310">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>313</span>
with £7 million spent on intermediate treatment compared to £85 million on local authority CHEs and observation and assessment centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is considerable cause for concern, first of all, about the inconsistency of intermediate treatment provision from one local authority area to another, the different types, the different quality, the different intensities of intermediate treatment schemes and, more particularly, the actual lack of intermediate treatment schemes at all in some local authority areas. Indeed, very few local authority areas have a complete intermediate treatment facility available. Ten per cent, of local authorities last year spent 38 per cent, of the total amount expended on intermediate treatment. A further 10 per cent, of local authorities spent less than £5,000 in the entire year on intermediate treatment, that is less than it cost per place per year per child to hold them in a residential institution. Again, that demonstrates our lopsided sense of priorities that 10 per cent, of local authorities can spend less on a highly successful venture such as intermediate treatment than they actually spend on keeping one child in a residential institution during that year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, I support the good intentions that lie behind clauses 19 and 20. As I pointed out to the Minister on a previous occasion, the good intentions that he and the Government apparently have, which are demonstrated by some of the provisions in the Bill, will not be realised in practice unless he is both willing and able to give more substantial amounts of money to local authorities and to voluntary organisations to provide intermediate treatment schemes than he has been prepared to provide in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Government will now enable the probation service to finance their own schemes. That is welcome. As we know, some local authority areas have been reluctant to provide, or have not provided, intermediate treatment. Now that the probation service can provide it itself, perhaps the Government ought to pick up the Bill in that particular context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know also that the Government have increased the amount of money that they have given to the Rayner foundation, intermediate treatment funds and, again, that they are giving local authorities additional finance. We have been told—this reinforces the point that my hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Lyon) was just making—that the total cost of this Bill will be about £8 million. The Minister said that in a parliamentary answer. We also know that the cost of one single measure— that is, the residential care order—is £5 million. That, too, the Minister has acknowledged in an answer to a parliamentary question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are, then, left with £3 million to cover all the additional expenses that will be incurred as a result of implementing the various provisions of the Bill. How much of that will actually go to local authorities for intermediate treatment? The Minister is making a big song and dance about its importance. So has the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for Social Services and their various underlings throughout the two years that they have been in office.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>314</span>
They have been saying the right things and I congratulate them on saying it. Here, however, they have their first opportunity to put their money where their mouths have been, yet we know that at the very maximum no more than £3 million will be made available in the Bill for all the services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As you know, Mr. Dean, amendment No. 46 was not selected. I understand the very good reasons why it was not, and in no way dispute that decision. The amendment would have enabled the Government to have made grants to local authorities specifically for, and tied to, the provision of intermediate treatment. I know that all Governments are reluctant to accept that principle, but the Government have made it clear that law and order services are paramount, and have gone further still and said that the children's services are regarded as an integral part of law and order services. The then Secretary of State for Social Services, the right hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Patrick Jenkin), speaking in Sheffield on 9th July 1979 said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government is prepared to regard child care services as an integral part of the national pattern of law and order services, and to have the priority which that accords it."</p></blockquote>
Fine words. There we have it. Child care services, of which intermediate treatment is presumably an integral part, have a high priority. They are regarded as
	<br><blockquote><p>"part of the national pattern of law and order services, and … have the priority which that accords it."</p></blockquote>
The only trouble is that
	<br><blockquote><p>"to have the priority which that accords it"</p></blockquote>
suggests a very low priority, on the evidence of the money available here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are precedents for grants being made for specific services. We have it with the secure units in the community home system under the Children's Act 1975, where substantial amounts of money have been given to local authorities, tied to the provision of secure units. Again, section 2 of the Local Government Act 1966, provides for specific grants for the programme for ethnic minorities. There are also many other precedents where the Government have regarded a particular service as having a high national priority; where there is a clearly determined and articulated national policy; where it is essential that local authorities and other organisations be enabled to comply with that policy and that priority; and are enabled to do so by grants tied to the provisions of that specific service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should now do the same for intermediate treatment. If they do not provide sufficient finance, local authorities will not provide the intermediate treatment, and if they do not tie it to intermediate treatment, they will certainly not provide the schemes that the Government accept are both advisable and necessary. By the way, there will still certainly be an enormous variation both in the provision and quality of the schemes provided. The result will be what we all, apparently, wish to avoid. Unless more, better and more effective intermediate treatment schemes are provided by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0311">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>315</span>
local authorities, in which the courts can have confidence—the Minister keeps saying that the courts must have confidence in community-based schemes, supervised activities, and the intermediate treatment schemes—we shall need more of them, of higher quality and better funded than they are at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that does not happen, more young people will be shovelled into penal institutions. We all, presumably, want to avoid that. Perhaps the Minister will now indicate that he will make a reality of some of the fine words that he has uttered, and which exist in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Lyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Hemel Hempstead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important clause because it brings us into a world that might well be misunderstood by the public at large, known as intermediate treatment. That is probably as woolly a catch phrase for some rather weak matters and some extremely important, strong and effective forms of treatment as one could find in the jargon of the social services. What does somebody expect when he is intermediately treated? He might well be in complete doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The underlying aim of this whole Bill is to try to provide a more effective structure within which to deal with offenders, and particularly young offenders. We know, because the figures are incontrovertible, that when they are taken away from home and placed in residential care of any form, borstal training—what is now to become youth custody—or any form of custodial treatment, the chances of being convicted of reoffending within two years increase dramatically. Simply to be taken into residential care means that statistically a person is likely to be convicted in more than two-thirds of cases. We know that the conviction rate is very much lower than the offence rate, whereas, the statistical chances of a person reoffending, if that person can be dealt with effectively at home, are very much better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we need from intermediate treatment is treatment of the young offender that is rigorous and effective. Where I part company with the hon. Members for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) and York (Mr. Lyon) is in thinking that we cannot make progress without throwing more money at the problem. Much of what they said I agree with, but local authorities already expend a great deal of money on the care and treatment of young offenders in residential care. They have pointed out—and if they have not, it is well known—that the cost of residential care per week in an ordinary residential home is about £250. The figures rightly stagger the public when they are compared with the cost of the most expensive private education in the country, yet we know that two-thirds of the people who go into these residential homes reoffend, or are convicted of reoffending, within two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Actual practical efforts in training and treating young offenders have shown that with really rigorous forms of intermediate treatment—I use the phrase because nobody has yet devised a better one for all its faults—one can see dramatic improvements in the rate of recidivism, but it is essential
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>316</span>
that that intermediate treatment should be rigorous and effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to mention some of the studies and forms of treatment carried out either by the university of Lancaster and under its guidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree that the system of intermediate treatment should be effective. Whether it should be rigorous depends on how effective the alternative systems are, but I certainly agree it should be effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not argue that we should throw money at it in addition to the total. I said that we ought to rejig our priorities so that we spend less on custodial sentencing and more on intermediate treatment because I think it is more effective. I thought that was the point the hon. Gentleman accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the clarification by the hon. Gentleman, and I have no doubt that that clarification will make his remarks easier for my hon. and learned Friend to accommodate. I gather that he agrees with me that local authorities already spend a lot of money on this kind of care and treatment and what he wants, and what I would like to see, is them diverting some of that money away from residential care which is ineffective into rigorous—and I repeat the word—and effective forms of intermediate treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A young offender needs to know why he has offended and how he can avoid offending in future. He should be given some guidance as to how he can better spend the time which he has all too frequently in the past spent in misdemeanour and how he can spend that time more constructively outside school or working hours, assuming that he is in work or at school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The studies that have been carried out on the basis of 30-day supervision are rigorous. That is important. If the young offender is still at school, they make very sure that he turns up at school. They may ring up at break or at lunchtime. They may go round at lunchtime. They ensure that he is at school, because truancy and young offending are intimately linked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After school, they either take him out and introduce him to useful activities that are likely to continue after the 30-day period of rigorous supervision, or they get him to understand, in detailed and careful discussion, why he has offended and—much more constructively—how he may be able to back off from the situation that has led him to offend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The costing of these studies is not yet satisfactory. I have heard figures which are so low—about £50 a week—that they could apply to this kind of treatment only if it were carried out by a university or with a higher measure of voluntary effort than one would be lucky enough to find over the country as a whole. The costing needs to be looked at more carefully. Nevertheless, this kind of treatment could probably be carried out for considerably less than the £250 a week which is likely to be spent on ineffective residential care. My hon. and learned

Friend, through the Home Office, will be anxious to encourage this kind of rigorous and effective treatment of young offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason I welcome the clause as a central part of the Bill—its engine room—in trying to improve the position of the young offender.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had one of our best debates on this clause and I am grateful, Mr. Dean, that you have allowed us to range fairly widely—today in particular—over the philosophy of intermediate treatment. One of the encouraging things about this part of our discussions has been the common ground that exists. First, it is better, if it is consistent with the protection of the public, for a juvenile offender to be dealt with without being taken out of the community; and, secondly, a good deal of encouragement is to be gained from our experience of intermediate treatment so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also common ground that there is worrying disparity in the provision of intermediate treatment. I agree with what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young), then Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security. It was quoted in the publication of the all-party Penal Affairs Group and the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) has today referred to it., He expressed the Government's anxiety about that. None the less, substantial progress has been made from which we can take some encouragement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon) referred to the proportion of cases in which juveniles found guilty of indictable offences received intermediate treatment. I can give him some of the figures that he asked for on which he invited comment. In 1980, 18 per cent, of the 175,000 juveniles cautioned or found guilty of indictable offences were sentenced to a supervision order. That is 16,400. Of those, 3,100 were orders with requirements, that is, with intermediate treatment. Six per cent.—5,800—were sent to detention centres and 2 per cent.—1,700— were sent to borstal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about the provision to be made by central Government for intermediate treatment. We must be careful here. It is clear that more overall expenditure is necessary and we all agree that, were we not trammelled by the economic restraints of today's conditions, here, as in many other areas, we would want to see more money made available and would, of course, make it available. We must live within the constraints imposed upon us by the economic times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent years, the DHSS has encouraged local authorities to develop their facilities. The local authorities' response has been very encouraging. Expenditure on I.T. has risen from under £1 million in 1976–77 to over £6 million in 1981 and, as I mentioned to the Committee when we last met, some £9 million is estimated for this financial year. As the hon. Member for Ormskirk fairly gave us credit for this morning, the Bill will also enable the probation service to finance intermediate treatment facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>318</span>
It is unrealistic to expect a substantial provision of new sums to be forthcoming from central Government at the moment. Local authorities are themselves in the best position to assess their own needs and priorities, but the DHSS has increased its grant to the I.T. fund. In 1981, the increase was from £273,000 to about £340,000. It has also increased the number of grants made to voluntary organisations from £440,000 to £657,000. We have, as a Government, given an undertaking that the proposals for the strengthened supervision order will not be implemented without the necessary additional funds being made available to local authorities, and I hope that they will be made available very quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman. What he says is very welcome. Will he therefore comment on the 1980 report " Cuts in Local Authority Spending on Personal Social Services "—the Minister is complaining already— published by the Social Priorities Alliance which found that 19 per cent, of their detailed sample of local authorities had actually cut their intermediate treatment budgets in 1979–80 and 6 per cent, cut them in 1980–81?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are here in the dilemma that faces central Government when considering to what extent it is desirable overall to impose their policy upon local authorities, all the time recognising the importance of the principle of local authorities being able to make their own arrangements and priorities in their own areas. Without necessarily accepting the figures that have been given, I would naturally regret any cut in sums made by any local authorities for intermediate treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other side of the coin is that the local authorities themselves do not, I understand, favour the earmarking of specific grants, whether for I.T. or for anything else. Though we would certainly like to see further increases in money spent on I.T., I do not believe that specific earmarking is the right way to go about this. The Government would expect the cost of any direct grants to be made by local authorities to be contained within the total central Government support for services provided by local authorities. If we were to depart from our principle, it would have to be, I am afraid, by reducing by an equivalent amount the sums made available elsewhere to local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just a salutary reminder. In 1975, I think it was, we allocated £2 million extra expenditure to the DHSS and to local health authorities to provide secure places in mental hospitals. Almost without exception, the health authorities used that money for quite different purposes, with the result that we never got the secure places in mental hospitals that we wanted. As a result, mentally handicapped criminals are kept in prison. Surely something should be done to ensure that the Home Office allocates money of this kind. It could be done by a specific grant rather than through the rate support grant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am well aware of the crying shortage of secure accommodation outside special hospitals. The hon. Gentleman, who carried my
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0313">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>319</span>
responsibilities before me, will know of the great difficulties that we face in getting people who do not need the security of the special hospitals into the type of secure accommodation that ought to be available for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not think that we can look at the increased expenditure of the local authorities on I.T., which I have mentioned to the Committee this morning, and divine there a reluctance to spend more on I.T. generally. I shall pay atention to what is said in the Committee, but local authorities are not in favour of specifically earmarked grants, and I am not persuaded that it would be right to proceed in that way. If grants are earmarked for specific purposes, that limits the discretion of local authorities to determine their own priorities and to be accountable for them. I am not persuaded that intermediate treatment is sufficiently exceptional to justify a breach of the general principle that financial support by central Government for local authorities should be by means of rate support grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked by the hon. Member for Ormskirk how the sums that will be required by the provisions of the Bill are broken down. £8 million a year is the estimated cost to local authorities of implementing clauses 19 and 20 only, not the Bill as a whole. That sum is expressed at current price levels. Some £6 million represents the cost of the residential care order—the remaining £2 million is the estimated cost of implementing the strengthened supervision order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for York ranged fairly broadly in his remarks on shorter sentences and placed the desirability of these in the context of the Government's policy in encouraging intermediate treatment. I quite agree that we wholly support and welcome the guidance that has been given by the Lord Chief Justice, both recently and about a year ago, in the Court of Appeal, to the effect that where a custodial sentence is deemed to be necessary, care should be taken to see that it is as short as possible. We welcome that and it is right that guidance in these matters should come from the Court of Appeal and from the Lord Chief Justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not agree with what the hon. Gentleman said about the impropriety of those who speak from the position of senior police officers on these matters. I think that we gain rather than lose by the expression of opinions on matters of policy generally. It is in tune with the way in which we conduct our affairs nationally today that discussion on these matters should be open. I wholly reject any implication that the Chairman of the Association of Chief Police Officers is, as it were, seeking to undermine the policy of my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know Mr. Pain far better than that. He is chief constable in my own county of Kent, and there is no question of him or any other senior police officer seeking to undermine the position, authority and jurisdiction of Parliament. I am quite certain of that. Today, however, we are faced with many
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>320</span>
intractable problems, not least the problem of the violent offender, and the violent young offender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I thought it right to say on several occasions in the past, our constituents in most instances feel that the violent young offender has always to expect that a substantial sentence, in one form of custody or another, will always be available, if only because, during the time that he is serving that sentence, he will not be able to hurt other people again. This is the intractable dilemma that we face—the need to do all that we can to prevent that young offender from re-offending, and to deter others like him from offending for the first time—something which it is impossible, by definition, to measure—and on the other hand, the need to provide the protection to the public that I have described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not an intractable dilemma. All the evidence that we have discussed in the Committee indicates that the people who are at present in the overcrowded prisons are not the serious violent offenders, but the people who have been sent there for sentences of less than four years for non-violent offences. That is why we support, and the Home Secretary joins with us in supporting, shorter sentences. As for the Chief Constable of Kent, he specifically argued against that policy, which is the Home Secretary's policy, on the grounds that all we were doing was failing to pay enough money to provide custodial sentences for the offenders whom he thought ought to be sent to prison. It is about time that he was told that that is simply wrong. He is not supposed to be paid by the public to go round questioning the Home Secretary's policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have said that I am absolutely confident that Mr. Pain is not seeking to undermine the position or jurisdiction of Parliament, or the position or jurisdiction of the Home Secretary. On the other hand, I believe him to be entirely entitled to express his own opinions, and I do not think it necessary for me to say one word more about that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I absolutely agree about the need to follow the guidance given by the Lord Chief Justice, and I hope that the welcome trend downwards in the average length of sentences—which is already discernable —will continue in the classes of offenders who are non-violent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This, however, takes us rather far from the philosophy of the clause, which deals with the provision of facilities for intermediate treatment. It is a very good thing, as I said at the beginning, that we all welcome the advances that have been made, and that all of us are on the same side in acknowledging the value of intermediate treatment. Many important points have been made, and I shall pay close attention to them when we come to review our debates. We all support the purpose and effect of clause 20, and would all like to see more money made available. I think that no substantial questions have been raised in the debate that I have not dealt with in my reply, and I hope that it may be possible for us

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 81 and 79 are tabled in the names of myself and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson). Amendment No. 81 seems to me to be very clear and obvious. If the residential care order is introduced, the local authority would be responsible for providing residential care. Surely, it follows from that it should be specifically consulted, not just about any residential placement but an appropriate one for that particular offender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill as it stands does not mention that such consultation would be required or that it definitely should take place. If the Committee agrees that such consultation should take place if the local authority provides this care and should, therefore, have to say about what was available and appropriate to that particular offender, it is clear that the court should be required to make this consultation. That is what the amendment seeks to achieve, so that it is quite clear in the Bill before the legislation goes any further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 79 relates to the requirement that the court shall give its reasons in writing for awarding a residential care order. Here again, it seems obvious that this should be necessary for the benefit not only of the offender but also of the legal repre-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>322</span>
sentatives of the offender and the public generally. It is not without precedent that these sorts of reasons are given in writing. It would emphasise to the court the serious nature of the decision that it was making and would concentrate the mind of the court as to why it was being done if it had to be put in writing. Secondly, it would facilitate appeals either by the subject of the order or his or her legal representative or by the local authority if this was actually in writing instead of just being given orally in court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that these two amendments can be accepted by the Minister as they seem to me to be both obvious and necessary and certainly deserve to be put in the Bill before the legislation is enacted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to address my remarks to new clauses 5, 6, 7, 20, 21 and 22, all of which embody proposals to reform the current system of care orders in criminal proceedings. They all follow recommendations made by the all-party Penal Affairs group in our report, " Young Offenders, a Strategy for the Future ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I ought to apologise at the beginning, because as the Committee will realise there are six new clauses here which cover extremely important issues on a new part of the Bill. Therefore, perhaps, I shall be taking slightly longer than hon. Members would have wanted me to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about a new and, certainly, a very important subject. Before I discuss each of the new clauses that I have tabled on behalf of my colleagues, perhaps I ought to explain the general reasoning that led to the group's very firm conclusion that the system of care orders in criminal proceedings is a major source of injustice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that hon. Members will be aware that care orders are available both in civil proceedings and in criminal proceedings for children under the age of 17, and that a care order commits a child to the care of the local authority which would normally then have to determine whether that child is held in a residential institution, whether it is fostered, whether it is subject to some other kind of supervision or, indeed, whether it is returned back home to its parents. In criminal proceedings, however, which is our concern at the moment, the intention of the court making the care order is normally that the child should be removed from its home and unless that order is discharged by the court it will continue until the child reaches the age of 18. Indeed, the average length of time for which care orders are made in criminal proceedings lasts for something like three years. In recent years, there has been a fall in the number of care orders made for juvenile offenders and a resultant drop in the number of care orders. In 1980, for example, 4,300 such orders were made in criminal proceedings compared with 7,500 in 1971.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite this welcome fall, the number of young people in institutions on any one day as the result of care orders made in criminal proceedings is four times the number of those held in penal institutions. On 31 March 1979 6,700 young offenders were resident in local authority community homes while, in relative terms, only 1,500 juveniles were in borstals and detention centres. Whereas most juveniles
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0315">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>323</span>
serving detention centre sentences spend about six weeks in custody—that is three months with half remission—they spend an average of nine months in custody if they are sentenced to borstal training. However, those who are subject to criminal care proceedings can be in custody for well over a year. Therefore, more offenders are held for a longer time in local authority institutions as a result of care orders in criminal proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That goes against the growing volume of research evidence, provided not least by some of the major reports produced by the DHSS, that most young offenders who are remitted to residential establishments under care orders are inappropriate subjects for such orders. Much of the evidence has been collected by the Centre of Youth Crime and Community at Lancaster university. In a series of recent studies in different local authority areas, the centre has analysed care orders made on young offenders and measured them against a set of criteria designed to establish whether there was a genuine need for the orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The criteria were reasonable. They were, first, whether a child was a danger to himself or to the community; secondly, whether he had any educational, medical or other special needs which could best be met in a residential setting; and, thirdly, whether he was without a home and family in a community which could, with appropriate support, provide adequate care and control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The researchers found that in Oldham, for example, 90 per cent, of young offenders in residential care did not satisfy even one of the three elementary criteria. In Basildon the figure was 70 per cent, and in Wakefield it was 80 per cent. The figures from a number of other areas are all very similar. That is appalling. Fairly stringent criteria are laid down when a care order to hold a child in a residential institution is appropriate and, measured by the criteria to which I have referred, 90 per cent., 80 per cent, and 70 per cent, of children in three areas are being held in local authority residential institutions inappropriately. It is clear that the majority of care orders are not justified. The blame cannot properly be placed on the courts, although it is the courts which made the decisions. The blame attaches, certainly in the first instance, to the local authority social workers who make the recommendations that the courts invariably enact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Research carried out by the DHSS shows also that the majority of care orders made in criminal proceedings are for young people who have been convicted of petty property offences, few of them with previous convictions. For example, 40 per cent, of the care orders made in criminal proceedings are imposed upon first offenders and 60 per cent, are imposed upon first or second-time offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the important DHSS research report entitled " Young Offenders in Care ", which was published in 1978, the author, Pat Cawson, asked a key ques-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>324</span>
tion in a section which has been quoted several times in the House of Commons. She asked:
	<br><blockquote><p>" If many children are still being prosecuted and removed from home at the first sign of delinquency, or for very trivial offences … if they are still to a large extent being placed in the former approved schools and remand homes, and by all indications often spending longer periods in those establishments at an earlier age … then what has happened to key sections of the 1969 Act?"</p></blockquote>
It may be unpalatable that such a disturbing situation has been allowed to develop with very little protest—it is especially so for those of us who have been well steeped in the well-intentioned but sometimes half-baked notions governing the approach to delinquency which led to the Children and Young Persons Act 1969, an approach that often hopelessly orders are justified on the grounds of the child's welfare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many young offenders are deprived of their liberty and removed from home under care orders in circumstances where the offence does not justify it and where their welfare does not justify it. That happens because social workers claim that the majority of the orders are justified on the grounds of the child's welfare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There might be a great deal to be said for that view if there were the slightest evidence that committing a young offender to a residential establishment was likely to reduce the chances of his reoffending. However, all the available evidence shows convincingly and overwhelmingly that residential care is ineffective in preventing young people from reoffending. Indeed, the reconviction rates for children leaving local authority community homes with education is around 70 per cent., which is not that dissimilar from the reconviction rate of 76 per cent, of juveniles in the detention centres or the 83 per cent, rate within two years of juveniles leaving borstal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system of care orders in criminal proceedings is indefensible on the grounds of justice and of welfare. When a young offender is given a care order and sent to a community home following a court appearance for a minor offence, who can blame him for feeling aggrieved at receiving a harsher treatment than a similar offender from a better home background who receives a fine, a conditional discharge or a supervision order? It is patently unfair and unjust that similar offenders with similar offences but different backgrounds are treated so fundamentally differently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an article which appeared in the journal "Family Law" in 1978, Brian Harris, who is the president of the Justices Clerks' Society, observed that a 10-year-old child who commits a minor offence can find himself the subject of an order which could take him away from his parents for the next eight years. That is not because anyone believes that that is the appropriate punishment, not because anyone wants to be vindictive or harsh and not because anyone believes that it may benefit him, but because the Bench has been persuaded that it is allegedly in the child's best interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0316">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>325</span>
Brian Harris argued that that resulted, not unnaturally, in a great sense of injustice both among parents and the children concerned. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If a child is brought before the court in care proceedings social workers, teachers and other witnesses will be called to give evidence on oath and what they have to say will be fully disclosed to the child and his parents, who will have the opportunity to cross-examine the applicant's witnesses and of calling witnesses of their own."</p></blockquote>
That is all right. We all like, accept and defend that. However, he added:
	<br><blockquote><p>"By contrast, the determination of ' sentence' in criminal proceedings is a very cursory affair… a child who is made the subject of a criminal charge… can be taken away from his home on a care order ' for his own good' without any of the safeguards that Parliament has seen fit to lay down for care proceedings where a child's welfare is the sole consideration."</p></blockquote>
The Black report on legislation and services for children and young persons in Northern Ireland, which was published in 1979, had an extremely important influence upon the thinking of the all-party Penal Affairs Group. The report recommended that care orders should not be available to the juvenile courts when they are dealing with criminal cases, and it proposed that except for very serious offences all existing custodial and residential orders for juveniles should be amalgamated into a single determinate sentence with a maximum of two years and a minimum of one month subject to half remission which, of course, applies in Northern Ireland to adult offenders as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report argued that courts would thereby be given the opportunity:
	<br><blockquote><p>" of fixing the period to be spent in custody in accordance with their assessment of the gravity of the offence and the potential danger to society, rather than leaving release dates to be settled by others according to different criteria."</p></blockquote>
That is from paragraph 6.29. It proposed that the order should be used sparingly and only
	<br><blockquote><p>"in particularly serious or harmful cases",</p></blockquote>
and that sentences should be served in mixed, secure establishments with a helpful and supportive regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government, again to their enormous credit, accepted the proposals and announced to the House of Commons that they were implementing them. Indeed, in making the announcement to the Northern Ireland Committee on 5 November 1980, the then Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office, estimated that of the young offenders then in Northern Ireland's training schools nearly half did not need to be in a custodial or residential establishment if the sole criterion was the gravity of the offences. He said that in future only the more serious offenders, against whom society needs protection, would be removed from home and taken into residential institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The all-party Penal Affairs Group was strongly attracted by that approach, which combines a clearly understood element of punishment for a serious or a persistent young offender with the important safeguard of a determination to reduce the number of young offenders committed to institutions. Therefore, the group recommended at paragraph 1.87 that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Care orders should no longer be an available option in criminal proceedings, but should be replaced by a new
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>326</span>
determinate residential order designed for a small minority of persistent or serious young offenders who require an element of punishment (represented by loss of liberty, not by a harsh or negative regime) and secure containment."</p></blockquote>
That proposal is contained in new clause 20. To avoid any misunderstanding, I should stress that there are some young people, both offenders and non-offenders, for whom removal from home is necessary because of the damaging effects upon them of life within their families, but where a care order is required in such circumstances it should be on welfare orientated grounds and civil care proceedings should be instituted. This process should not be allowed to be confused with dealing with a young offender for criminal proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The group recognised that the Government were unlikely to introduce overnight such a far-reaching and fundamental change as that which it had proposed, even though it seems far-sighted, radical and sensible to do it in Northern Ireland. Accepting that the Government would not necessarily move at this stage, we have submitted a range of short-term proposals that is designed to increase the safeguards for those who have become, or are at risk of becoming, the subject of care orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, we have adopted a proposal made by the Magistrates' Association, the Justices' Clerks' Society and New Approaches to Juvenile Crime, all of which have argued that an offer of legal representation should be mandatory before a care order is made. That proposal is contained in new clause 21. That is an extremely important principle, to which we have already referred in a different context, in our consideration of other parts of the Bill. It is a theme that has continued throughout this debate. We regard it as extremely important that no care order should be made in criminal proceedings unless at least the child and the parents have had the option of being properly and adequately legally represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that a juvenile cannot be sent to a detention centre for the first time for what is in practice a six-week sentence, and which could under the Bill be as little as two weeks, without being offered legal representation. Yet under a care order a young person can be removed from home and sent to an institution for a much longer period. That is clearly inequitable and it should be put right, and we have the opportunity to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the all-party Penal Affairs Group re commended that the position of a young offender subject to a care order should be regularly reviewed by a body that includes one or more members of the juvenile Bench, before which the child, his parents and foster-parents, where appropriate, should have the right to appear. At present local authorities carry out a purely internal review of a care order every six months. That may seem to be appropriate, yet the Magistrates' Association said in May 1980, in its comments on the Children and Young Persons Act 1969—it is always important to quote the Magistrates' Association—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Reviews are admittedly undertaken by the local authority every six months, but they appear to be of a very
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0317">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

cursory nature. … We do not know of any local authority which holds a formal review where the child is legally represented or where his views are expressed."</p></blockquote>
The Scottish equivalent of the care order, which is the supervision order with a residential requirement, lapses after a year unless it has been reviewed by a children's hearing. It is wrong that there is no independent element in reviews in England and Wales for young people who have been subjected to care orders. New clause 5 provides for reviews to be carried out by a body which includes at least one representative of the magistracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the group recommended that more precise criteria should be laid down for the making of care orders in criminal procedures. It suggested that the criteria should provide that care orders should be recommended or made only where it is the intention that the child should immediately be removed from home, and that this should be based on strict criteria concerning the needs of the child and the threat that he or she poses to the community. New Clause 22 contains statutory criteria along these lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The group paid particular attention to the fact that an increasing number of children given care orders are now spending some time—in some cases a considerable time—in secure accommodation. As members of the Committee will know, two major research studies on secure units have been published in the fairly recent past: first, the Dartington Social Research Unit's study "Locking up Children", which was published in 1978 and, secondly, the DHSS research report " Children Referred to Closed Units ", which was published in 1979. Both those studies show, from totally different sources, that secure units are currently being used for younger and less delinquent children than was the case several years ago, and that the reconviction rates on leaving the secure units are, again, high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Dartington unit's research study found that only 38 per cent, of admissions to secure units in 1975 were aged over 14J, compared with 65 per cent, in 1971. Of the 587 boys released from secure units and followed up for two years, 76 per cent, of those released into the community re-offended. The majority therefore underwent a further spell in an institution, usually a borstal. The authors commented:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the majority of boys the secure units provide a brief sojourn in an expensive anteroom to the penal system."</p></blockquote>
The DHSS study, which was concerned with children referred to secure units at Kingswood, Redhill, Red Bank and St. Charles's youth treatment centres from 1971 to 1974, produced similar findings. That study again found that the children referred were younger than those admitted to the units before 1971 and that they had a less serious history of offending. Of a sample of 40 children whose subsequent progress was followed up by the researchers, 78 per cent, reoffended in the year following discharge, and 40 per cent, of them committed six or more offences in that one-year period. The researchers concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Children admitted to the units had in some respects a poorer record after discharge than would have been expec-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>328</span>
ted from their previous records, which may indicate a criminogenic effect of admission to a unit, particularly in the younger and less criminally sophisticated … there are clear indications that a trend towards admitting younger and less delinquent children to closed units is a dangerous one which should be reconsidered."</p></blockquote>

Those are not the remarks of a half-baked university researcher or a liberal do-gooder. They come from eminently respectable and well-qualified researchers at the Department of Health and Social Security, who are prepared to put in a Government publication warnings and advice of that nature. It is time that the Government started taking notice of their own research units. They are saying that we are putting younger and less delinquent children into residential and secure accommodation and that that is a dangerous trend because we are making criminals out of those who were probably not criminals when they entered the institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present the only external check on the use of secure accommodation—which is being so clearly condemned as ineffective, wasteful and dangerous— is a review every three months of children in secure accommodation by a committee which, according to the community homes regulations, must include one independent person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1981 the report of a DHSS working party on legal and professional aspects of the use of secure accommodation for children in care pointed out that a three-monthly review:
	<br><blockquote><p>"can become an administrative formality ".</p></blockquote>
That document proposed that there should be a right of application regarding a decision at such a review to confirm the detention of a child in secure accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report entitled "Young Offenders—A Strategy for the Future " recommended two types of safeguard for children in secure accommodation. First, it proposed that statutory criteria for the use of secure accommodation should be introduced, and new clause 6 contains those criteria. Secondly, it recommended that any decision by a three-monthly review committee to continue the detention of a young person in secure accommodation should be subject to confirmation by a juvenile court. That proposal is contained in new clause 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system of care orders in criminal proceedings has proved to be a serious source of injustice. Its results have promoted neither the justice nor the welfare that was intended by the 1969 Act. The parliamentary all-party Penal Affairs Group has given a great deal of thought to the proposals for reform contained in the new clauses which the Committee is discussing. It recognises that some of the proposals will be controversial. It knows that some of them go counter to many of the articulately expressed good intentions which many of us share, which have become commonplace in debates on penal policy and on juveniles in the past decade. However, it is convinced that the proposals in the new clauses are in the interests of the children concerned and of the community as a whole, which has a real stake in ensuring that justice is provided for children as well as adults. It is clear from the

evidence, some of which has been presented today, that children are not being treated in a just and humane system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Dubs 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Battersea, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The high rates of reoffending for young people who have been in custody must make us all want to think again about the effectiveness of custodial sentences and about whether there is not a better way of protecting society against offenders than putting them in various institutions in the knowledge that when they are released they are extremely likely to offend again. That is the basis of at least some of the amendments which we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Young people must be confused when they become mixed up with what one could call " the system ". They must be confused when, they have have committed no offence but, because their home background is inadequate and they lack stable parental support, they end up in residential care. They may be alongside other youngsters who clearly are offenders. The blurring of the distinction between young people whom we seek to punish and those whom we look after because of the inadequacies of their home backgrounds must make it much more difficult for young people to realise that for those whom we are punishing we are seeking to use the force of the law against them and, for those who are taken into care because their home backgrounds are inadequate or unsatisfactory, we are seeking not to punish but to help. If we blur the distinction, it is no wonder that young people do not easily recognise the distinction when they are being punished and should not commit the same sort of offence again and when they are being taken into care for the other reasons that I have stated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the Committee should take advantage of this opportunity to make that distinction. We cannot be happy about the way in which young people respond to what is being done to them. I hope that the Committee will consider the weight of evidence that has been submitted in some detail by my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) and will understand that this is not merely a point of view expressed by the Opposition on the spur of the moment. Considerable thought has been given to these matters by many bodies with a great deal of experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, when young people are taken into care they are receiving an intermediate sentence. If they are taken into care because they have committed an offence—although there is a procedure for review we should all agree that it is not a very satisfactory one—they may well end up spending three years in residential care. Yet a young person who has committed a more serious offence and has been sent to a detention centre is likely to be there for only six weeks. That is unfair and must make young people feel that the system is not acting justly. It must lead to the conclusion that many young people, when they leave residential care under the present system, are liable to re-offend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The all-party Penal Affairs Group went into these points in considerable detail and it clearly stated its view in the document " A Strategy for the Future ".

	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Jo Richardson 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Barking)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add a few words to the comprehensive case that was submitted by my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr .Kilroy-Silk). It is strange that of all the briefs which we have received in the Committee not one seems to be in favour of the clause. When one considers the various bodies of responsible opinion which have come out broadly against the clause, it is surprising that some of that thinking has not filtered through to the Government. I shall be interested to hear what the hon. and learned Gentleman says about that in his reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the cost could run into £5 million a year if the clause is adopted and its intention is carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am additionally concerned, quite apart from the effect upon the juveniles concerned, about how far the local authority will provide the wherewithal to provide the places. Local authorities are under severe public expenditure constraints. They are all agonising over which services they can cut, yet they will each presumably have to find more money. This is why I think that the amendments moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill), which suggest that the local authorities must be consulted, are relevant to our discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause which we are trying to amend, but which I think should be removed from the Bill, places local authorities in great difficulty. At present they are free to decide the best way to deal with a juvenile who is subject to a care order. However, in the clause we are taking away their real right to have that flexibility which they have always enjoyed. We are taking away the discretion which I think they have always used in a delicate, sensible and balanced way by saying that they may have to make additional residential placements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why tie the hands of the local authorities in this way? They already have a duty to observe the public interest and they ought to be left with the flexibility to proceed on a day to day basis without being hamstrung by the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the Government have suggested that the clause could lead to between 500 and 900 additional children requiring placement away from home. That is very much against the policy objective of trying to reduce numbers in residential and custodial care. The Minister will have to produce a very strong case for allowing the clause, which we are trying to amend, to remain in the Bill, and it will certainly not have my support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) need not have apologised in advance for one minute of the length of his speech because it was highly informed, highly relevant and of great value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has enabled us to range over the wide subject of the care order. It is an extraordinarily wide and in many ways perplexing topic. It is common ground between the local authorities and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0319">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>331</span>
the magistrates who reviewed the issue in 1978 that the making of a care order should presuppose that it is necessary for the child in all the circumstances to be removed from home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Removal of a person, and especially of a child, from his home has always to be regarded as an extremely grave act. Not surprisingly, therefore, the jurisdiction conferred by the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 to make a care order, whether or not it is made in care proceedings or in criminal proceedings, has been the subject of long debate and is still the subject of debate. This has stemmed primarily from the philosophy of the Act—here I take up a point made by the hon. Member for Battersea, South (Mr. Dubs).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The philosophy of the Act has aimed to blur the distinction between the offending and the non-offending child by including as one of the primary grounds for making a care order in care proceedings the fact that the juvenile has committed an offence and by making a care order also available in criminal proceedings, but in the context of criminal proceedings the crucial point, it seems to me, is that the care order is indeterminate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may fairly be said—and I have said it myself so it must be able to be fairly said—that the philosophy of the Bill is to substitute " determinate " for " indeterminate " sentences for young offenders, and yet it is said against us that section 7(7) of the 1969 Act simply provides that a court which convicts a juvenile shall have power,
	<br><blockquote><p>"if the offence is punishable in the case of an adult with imprisonment, to make a care order … in respect to him."</p></blockquote>
I see the force of what has been said today, that resentment and a sense of injustice can result where, by reason of disparity of background, there is great disparity in the disposal of one juvenile offender compared with the disposal of a sentence of the order made by the court of another for a not dissimilar offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for this reason that at one extreme of the argument there is, for example, new clause 20, which proposes an entirely new disposal to replace the use of indeterminate care orders for juveniles in criminal proceedings who offend—that is, the new determinate sentence of up to two years, about which the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) has just spoken. On the other side of the spectrum there is the opinion that bases itself on the principle that young offenders should not be put into custody save as a last resort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is enshrined in the earlier part of the Bill. It sees the care order in criminal proceedings as one means of dealing with a young offender from whom the public need to be protected, yet which will not put him into an exclusively penal establishment. It will put him in custody, such as a detention centre, a borstal, or youth custody which will succeed it, or prison. Of course, in community homes a high proportion of residents are there be-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>332</span>
cause of criminal proceedings, but the atmosphere and the regime of those homes is very different from that of a Prison Department establishment, such as a detention centre or a borstal. Increasingly, I believe that other ways of accommodating young offenders the subject of a care order, especially, for example, in foster homes, are being used in substitution for community homes. Thus, clause 21 holds to the concept of the care order in criminal proceedings, seeing value in its survival even in circumstances in which the juvenile offender has committed a further serious offence in the course of the care order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme of clause 21 is that where that eventuality has occurred, when the juvenile has been living at home—for example, under the direction of the local authority or with a relative or friend as directed by the local authority—the court may direct that the care order shall continue but with the local authority's discretion to make any such direction of that kind suspended for up to six months. By this means, the court may ensure that the juvenile is removed from the home which it believes to have influenced the commission of the latest offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key point I wish to make about the provision of clause 21—what is loosely called the residential care order, but more accurately described as the suspension of this discretionary power of the local authority to which I have referred—is that it represents an alternative to custody, where no alternative exists, to the court which does not believe it to be right to permit the child to continue in the home which, in its opinion, has contributed to the commission of the further offence. At present there is no alternative to custody if the court believes it to be right to remove the child from that home. It is an alternative to custody, and it is a total misreading of the clause to regard it as custodial in nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have described these two wings of opinion— extremes of the spectrum—but it would be wrong to suppose that there is no ground in between which their proponents cannot harmoniously occupy together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened with great care to all that has been said in this composite debate, and have found the hon. Member for Ormskirk particularly persuasive in support of new clause 6. I had not at first believed that we should be able to go very far in the direction that he was urging in new clause 6, the effect of which is to require the local authority or organisation managing a home which contains secure accommodation, to satisfy itself before placing a child in security that he would be likely to commit a secure offence, abscond, or to be violent towards himself or others. I had not at first believed that we should be able to go very far in that direction. I thought that at best we might be able to consider some adjustment to the community homes regulations of 1972, to take account of what he said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise, however, that the placement in secure accommodation of children is a particularly serious matter. The court makes the care order, but it does not at present control whether or to what
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0320">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>333</span>
extent a child may be put into secure accommodation pursuant to that care order. That is for the local authority. Therefore, with the thinking that lies behind new clause 6 I find myself in complete agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are, however, certain technical difficulties in the new clause as drafted. I am happy to be able to say to die hon. Gentleman that the Government accept it in principle, and undertake that its intention will be given effect in the Bill at a later stage. I am happy to give the hon. Gentleman that assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I similarly found attraction in the argument of the hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) in respect of amendment No. 79. The effect of this is to require the court to provide both the child and the local authority
	<br><blockquote><p>"with a written statement of the reasons for concluding that no other method of dealing with him "—</p></blockquote>
save by what we loosely call a residential care order—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is appropriate".</p></blockquote>
Quite apart from the possible—indeed discernible —merits of this provision, it is not one which in our view ought to be given effect in primary legislation. A measure of this kind is normally contained in the magistrates' courts children and young persons rules. Certainly clause 21(3) is intended to direct the court's mind towards the full consideration of the question whether any other method of dealing with the juvenile is appropriate. This is similar to the provision in clause 1(4) relating to custodial sentences, which is followed by a provision in clause 1(7) that a magistrates' court must state its reason for being of the opinion
	<br><blockquote><p>"that no other method of dealing with him is appropriate, and cause that reason to be specified in the warrant of commitment and to be entered in the register".</p></blockquote>
What troubles me is that there is not a direct analogue to be found in a sentence of custody for a juvenile offender. That is, or should be, the last resort, for reasons which we have discussed and which find expression in clause 1. Therefore, the case is strong for a written statement by the magistrate's court, at any rate of its reasons for concluding that no other method of dealing with him is appropriate, when we are talking about custody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in the case of a further offence committed while already under a care order, which is what we are talking about in amendment No. 79, custody may also be appropriate. In these circumstances, we all want to give the court the power to keep the young offender out of custody if that is possible. Therefore, I think that the effect of the amendment, if it remained unchanged, would possibly lead to more custodial sentences because one can visualise a circumstance in which the court may be minded to make a residential care order with the intention that the juvenile shall not go into custody, but may feel unable to do so because it could not say that custody would not be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can accept the spirit of the amendment, but I think that we ought to substitute in the rules in which it would appropriately find its place for the word " appropriate " something along the lines of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>334</span>
"necessity", so that it gives a reason why it found that a residential care order was necessary in all the circumstances. A measure of that kind ought to be in the magistrates' courts children and young persons rules rather than in the main legislation. But, having heard what the hon. Lady said, and having given thought to it, we undertake—if she will accept that—to make a change along these lines in the residential care order, subject to the qualification that I have indicated. I hope that she will find that satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not quite all. The case for new clause 22 the clause for criteria, cannot be so forcefully put. The clause adds guidelines to the circumstances in which a care order can be made in similar proceedings, and requires that such an order shall not be made unless the court considers:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(b) that the removal of the child or young person from the charge or control of his parents or guardian is necessary for the protection of the public or for his own protection.".</p></blockquote>
In other words, it narrows the gap between the criteria for a care order made in criminal proceedings and those for a care order made in care proceedings. I do not believe that that can be so forcefully put. Such an order could not be made unless the court considered that the juvenile needed to be removed from the charge or control of his own parent or guardian because of his own needs or for the protection of the public. Nevertheless, I recognise that there is increasingly wide support for the view that there should be some further restriction on the availability of care orders in criminal proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the point of the hon. Member for Ormskirk that care orders in criminal proceedings should go absolutely, but he was fair enough to recognise that that was too large a step to be capable realistically of being expected at this juncture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are aware of the concern expressed by the all-party Penal Affairs Group. The Government are firmly of the view that the care order should remain available for courts dealing with juveniles in criminal proceedings, but are prepared to consider whether any further guidance can usefully be given to the courts on the circumstances in which it is appropriate to use this disposal. As with the earlier amendments which sought to express in more definite terms the kind of factors to which a court could have regard in imposing certain sentences, the Government are still not confident that useful, comprehensive and effective guidelines can be devised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The terms of the new clause themselves serve to illustrate the difficulties involved. One of its provisions is that a care order should be made only if a juvenile has educational, vocational, medical, emotional or personal needs which can be met only by removing him from the charge or control of his parent or guardian. These requirements would be in addition to the fact that the child concerned had committed an offence for which he was liable to imprisonment. That raises the question of whether he should be before the court in criminal proceedings in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0321">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>335</span>
the first place. If he has such a battery of misfortunes, it may well be more appropriate to ensure that care proceedings are taken on one of the specific grounds set out in section 1 of the 1969 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole clause also presupposes that the child needs to be removed from the charge or control of his parent. It is common ground between the local authorities and the Magistrates' Association, as I mentioned, that the making of a care order should presuppose that it is necessary for the child in all the circumstances to be removed from home. But the local authority retains the discretion to place him at home at the appropriate time. The care order gives the social services department flexibility to exercise its professional discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The terms of the clause also assume that the care order can of itself protect the public from the young offender. It is important to remember that the degree of security afforded by care as such is relatively limited unless the local authority holds the offender in secure accommodation, or is able to do so. This is quite unnecessary for most children who are subject to care orders, as the terms of new clause 6 make clear. I agree that the care order should be seen by the courts as a serious response to offending and therefore reserved for cases which are sufficiently serious. I think that they are, in view of the number of care orders made in cases in which it is open to the courts to make them. But we should need to think carefully before writing into the statute restrictions which make the care order more like a custodial sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the most important consideration is whether it is in the longer terms advisable to make it much more difficult for a court to make a care order in criminal proceedings. In 1980, 116,500 juveniles were found guilty in the courts. Of those, only 4,700 were made subject to a care order. That is a very small proportion, so it is clear that the care order is generally used only for fairly serious cases. The danger is that, if we restrict the terms of the care order too much, there might be a greater use of custodial sentences for these offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought it right to mention these difficulties at this stage because the Government must advise the Committee to reject the new clause if it is taken to a vote. These are the difficulties which will stand in our way when, as we are quite willing to do, we go away and think about what further guidance might be given to the courts about the circumstances in which it is appropriate to make a care order in criminal proceedings. I am certainly prepared to do that, paying careful attention to what has been said today. I do not want to raise false hopes but we shall certainly consider most carefully whether anything can be done to give effect to the underlying attention of the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the remaining clauses in this composite debate, which has enabled us to deal with the whole concept of the care order, I am afraid that I cannot be so accommodating. I am afraid that we cannot accept amendment No. 81, which was moved by the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>336</span>
hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) with, greater and more commendable brevity than I, I am sorry to say, have managed to achieve. It will not, in our view, materially affect the way in which the new power is exercised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman says the local authority is not party to the decision, but surely it has the responsibility of providing residential care and only it knows whether that is available, and whether an appropriate residential placement of the appropriate kind for the offender is available. Therefore, consultation has taken place, and if the Minister admits that it has to take place, why not put it in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have indicated, of course the inquiries have to be made of the local authority itself in reaching the opinion that is central to the exercise of this power. The court will inevitably obtain a report from the local authority. But if this amendment were to be accepted it could have at least the appearance that the child's on rights in the case are comprised by agreement between the Bench and the local authority which already has him in its care. The local authority will have to bear the financial cost of keeping the juvenile in residential care if an order is made and it opens up the possibility that it would be advantageous to the local authority if the court decided that a custodial sentence was appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not suggesting that there are grounds for supposing that a local authority would be otherwise than scrupulous in advising the court, but the fact remains that local authorities do not, in the context of this provision, occupy a position of such conspicuous impartiality that it would be appropriate that they should have a statutory right to be consulted by the courts about the appropriateness of the sentence to be imposed on a juvenile offender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause so directly affects the interests of the local authority itself that we have, in subsections (6) and (7), made special provision for the local authority to have a right to apply for the variation of the revocation of the condition and the right to appeal against it. I must emphasise that we do not wish to suggest at all that there is any suspicion that any local authority would be otherwise than wholly scrupulous in advising the courts, but in the context of the provisions of this clause I do not think that the local authority occupies such a position of absolutely conspicuous and discernible impartiality that it is appropriate that it should be consulted by statutory right by the court about the appropriateness of the sentence to be imposed on a juvenile offender which it already has in its care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot advise the Committee to accept new clause 5, although I am entirely in sympathy with the intention behind it. The reason, in a nutshell, is that the resources simply are not there, greatly though we sympathise, with the thinking, which would require the Secretary of State to make regulations for the review of places of children in care as a result of criminal proceedings. The review would be carried out by a committee. The estimate of some £7·2 million a year has been made, and I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0322">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>337</span>
can say no more than that the resources simply are not there, I would be misleading the Committee if I were to suggest that there was any practical possibility of that course being accepted at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is equally the case with new clause 7, because decisions to admit a child to security or extend his placement in security should, in the view of the Government, be a matter of professional judgment. But we intend to revise the community homes regulations shortly and we will certainly take account, when we are undertaking that revision, of the points that have been made in support of new clause 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman supported new clause 20 by reference to the Black Committee's report in Northern Ireland. I heard what he said and will study that report with care, but, as the hon. Gentleman was frank enough to recognise, we cannot, as I have said already, make a leap of that nature as abruptly as the acceptance of new clause 20 would require. I have to be discouraging about new clause 22 as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that it has had quite wide support. I well understand the concern that underlies the requirement for legal representation. It is certainly true that a local authority can remove from home a juvenile who is made subject to a care order, but the difficulty again is largely one of resources. How nice it would be if I did not have to return to that difficulty so often.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Why, then, does he not drop the monumental irrelevance of the residential care order, which is acknowledged by everyone to be patently absurd and ineffective? That would save him, on his own testimony earlier this morning, £6 million, which would enable him to carry out the more desirable principles contained in new clauses 5, 7, 20 and 21. Would that not be far more sensible, and more in line with the policy of both the Home Office and of the DHSS? It would shift the resources away from residential or custodial care to treatment and care in the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman at an earlier stage in our debates made approving references to the Magistrates Association, and rightly so. He knows that the residential care order has long been sought by the Magistrates' Association, for reasons which they have set out in great detail. It was not right to describe such a measure as a " monumental irrelevance". The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly the reasons why it is necessary that there should be a provision of this nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to have taken so long, Mr Dean but it is inevitable—when we have this helpful selection of all the amendment and new clauses that bear upon the whole concept of the care order—that if I am to do justice to what has been said in the debate I should take rather a long time in replying. I am afraid that I am not able to go further than I have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>338</span>
indicated. I wish that there were more resources available, but that is a recurring theme, and I hope that the Committee will allow us to proceed on the basis that I have indicated. I should regret it if we were taken to a vote. The line I have had to draw has been drawn after very full consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think we can let the clause go by—even though we have debated potential amendments to it—without making a more substantial reference to the Government's introduction of the residential care order. I reiterate that I still regard this as a monumental irrelevance to the problems with which local authorities are confronted at the moment, and to the real problems of juvenile delinquency and juvenile crime. I suppose it is some consolation that the proposal that is actually in the Bill is at least a watered-down version of the proposal to introduce secure residential care which was in the Tory Party's last election manifesto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the representations that have been made to the Government on behalf of the new approaches to juvenile crime by Baroness Faithfull —the distinguished opponent among the Conservatives of the nonsense that is involved in a residential care order—has had the effect of watering down the proposal. Now the local authorities will be allowed, under the provisions of the Bill, to place a child with foster-parents, and there will be mandatory legal representation before a residential care order can be imposed. Yet, in spite of the fact that the Government have clearly back tracked to a considerable degree from their election manifesto, and from the original concept of a residential care order, even with all the safeguards or being able to foster, and having legal representation, it is still irrelevant and unnecessary, and the Government if they were wise or sensible, if they really meant what they said, instead of being cowed by the law and order lobby outside, would ditch it now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even in its modified form it will mean that there will be hundreds more young people put inappropriately and unjustly into residential institutions than would have otherwise been the case. We know, because the evidence is clear, that placing people, particularly young children, in residential institutions is ineffective if our objective is to stop them from committing further offences.

We do not have the figures of the reconviction rates from the new community homes of education, but we have figures of the old approved schools on which they are, very largely, still working. We know that in the 1960s something like 66 per cent, of those leaving approved schools were reconvicted of further offences within two years. I suggest that the figure of those leaving community homes, local authority residential institutions are not much dissimilar today. Indeed, Home Office research study No. 32, "Residential Treatment and its Effect on Delinquency", published in 1975, made a fairly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0323">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>339</span>
thorough job of studying the Kingswood CHE at Bristol. It looked at three units in the Kingswood CHE, one a so-called therapeutic unit, one organised on the traditional conventional lines, and a third unit, and followed up the reconviction rates of the young offenders leaving that CHE.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the therapeutic unit, 70 per cent, committed further offences; from the conventional approved school type unit, 69 per cent, were convicted; and from the third unit, 68 per cent. This shows, as the Advisory Council on the Penal System said in a different context, that the type of regime, in spite of the dedication and the hard work of the staff there, does not make very much difference to the offender and whether he or she will commit further offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That study demonstrates very clearly the ineffectiveness of residential institutions in general, and of CHEs in particular, at achieving the objective which we have all acknowledged in this Committee, on both sides of the House, in all parties, that we all share, of reducing offending among young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the additional study by Lancaster university published in 1979, entitled " Punishment and Welfare". This was of young offenders from the Rochdale community home of education, which showed that two-thirds of them re-offended within a very short period of their release.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, of course, much more of that evidence. The Government are aware of it. They sponsored a great deal of it, and promoted many of the research findings. Why, then, do they not act upon it? The Government have acted upon it in different areas for some reason. They are actually flying in the face of their own evidence in introducing the residential care order here today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many ways it is more worrying that on the Minister's testimony we are now spending £6 million more on putting young people into residential institutions at one and the same time that we are agreeing that residential institutions are ineffective, and when, as the Expenditure Committee said of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969, there ought to be a shift of emphasis and resources away from punitive custodial techniques towards measures of treatment and care in the community. At the same time when the Government endorse that view, they are actually bothering to spend £6 million more on something which we all agree will not achieve the results which the Government want, and which Labour Members also want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister for clarification of two aspects of the way in which the community care order will operate. First, can he say how the grants to finance the residential care order to local authorities will actually be allocated to the local authorities? The AMA, as he will know, argues that if it is allocated on precisely the same basis as the present finance for child care expenditure is allocated, that will mean that those local authorities with the more serious problems will not necessarily get the largest allocation, because, as the Minister will know, the grant related expenditure does not take into account either
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>340</span>
levels of unemployment or levels of delinquency. Clearly, it is patently absurd to allocate expenditure for this kind of measure without taking into account delinquency factors. So, perhaps he could give some indication of the kind of criteria that will be employed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, can he say whether those children subject to the residential care order will, in fact, get home leave. At present it is my understanding that children in community homes are normally allowed to spend short periods on leave at home with their parents as part of a programme designed to assist their eventual reintegration into the community. I want the Minister to be able to give an assurance, or at least to confirm, that short periods of home leave will not be ruled out for those children subject to a residential care order. If it is ruled out, it would put them in a totally different position in this respect from all other children in residential establishments, whether they have received a care order in criminal proceedings or civil proceedings, who are normally allowed to spend short periods with their families. The result would be highly invidious and damaging to both good child practice and to the relationship of the child and the staff in the residential establishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unfortunate that the Government are going ahead with this totally irrelevant and unnecessary measure. The Minister, in response to an earlier intervention of mine, said that it is supported by the Magistrates' Association and, of course, it is. The fact that I have endorsed, approved and agreed with much of what the Magistrates' Association has said in the past, does not mean to say, nor can it, that I naturally and unthinkingly endorse everything it says because I do not and I have made my opposition known, as has the all-party Penal Affairs Group. The hon. and learned Gentleman's hon. Friends made their opposition to this measure, and to the thinking that lies behind it and emanates from the Magistrates' Association, very clear. It will do nothing at all to reduce delinquency. It j will do nothing at all to deal with the real problems of those young people who get into trouble and who need help, not punishment. It will do nothing at all to help local authorities provide the necessary facilities and have the resources to meet their needs. For that reason if for no other it ought to be, and no doubt will be, vigorously opposed by my right hon. and hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that Conservative hon. Members will have gathered from the discussion that the Opposition are opposed to residential care orders. Although I proposed amendments to the Bill as it stands, I reserved my opposition to residential care orders in general to the clause stand part debate because we were trying to include what we are presented with in the Bill but, at the same time, we do not wish to see clause 21 in the Bill at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 21 removes a discretion from local authorities that they already have at the moment, and juvenile court magistrates will now have the power to remove a child from home who could not otherwise have been removed under the present law

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>341</span>
somebody who has committed a further criminal offence when he was under the custody of the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard in the debate that 4,698 care orders were made on juvenile offenders in criminal proceedings in 1980 and the majority of these young people were removed from home. The Minister has said this is comparatively few numerically compared with the number of young people who offend and that they are really people who have committed only serious offences. This seemed to justify in his mind having residential care orders—that there are relatively few people affected and that they commit serious offences. He pointed out that restricting the care orders might encourage courts to send the offenders to prison or into custody. Would it not also work the other way? There is a danger that residential care orders may be used as an alternative to a fine or a conditional discharge. His argument could be reversed, and he may encourage residential care orders by their very existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard a great deal of evidence during the debate about research work by different bodies which has shown that recidivism among children committed to care orders is high. The DHSS—Home Office re-offending survey in 1979 showed that about 57 per cent, of the children in care because of an offence would be reconvicted within two years. Surely that does not demonstrate the success of care orders— on the contrary, more than half the children subjected to them are reconvicted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been estimated that 2,677 of the juveniles made the subject of care orders as a result of criminal offences in 1980 will be vulnerable to the threat of the new care order. We have heard that 500 to 900 additional children will require placement away from home each year at a cost of £6 million. Residential care orders have been shown to result in recidivism of more than half of those subject to them. In addition, the new care order will be extremely expensive to carry out. There is no evidence that a care order either helps the young people involved or protects society from crime. The British Association of Social Workers, which has a wide knowledge of care orders, is extremely concerned about clause 21—and it has experience of dealing with offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not produced any evidence that a residential care order is a definite solution to the problem of re-offending. It is a policy of despair to carry on with something that has been shown to be unsuccessful and to accept a clause that will cost £6 million to implement. We have heard no real justification from the Minister for implementing the clause and we shall oppose it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a great day for the Magistrates' Association which as the Minister said, wholly supports the proposal, and has done so for many years. It has fought tooth and nail to get it, and now it has succeeded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister, in his reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill), failed to mention that almost everyone else is against the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>342</span>
proposal. He and the Magistrates' Association should ask themselves why. The association attempted to put pressure on me, when I was a Minister to give that power. We are talking not about a better way to deal with young offenders but a better way to soothe the amour-propre of the Magistrates' Association. It feels that if magistrates had the right to determine where a child should spend his period in care that would somehow be a more effective way of dealing with him. There is no evidence that that is true. When I took part in the great turmoil about the whole issue, I could never understand how all the community homes, which previously had been either remand homes or approved schools, were full to the brim, yet magistrates wanted to send more children to them. They felt that when they made care orders, local authority social service workers were simply not being tough enough with the young hooligans when sending them to some kind of confinement. In the good old days, the magistrates could send them to the former approved schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did my best to find the answer to that conundrum. I visited community homes to discover who was there. If the poor old magistrates could not send all the hardened, tough offenders to those community homes, who on earth was filling up the space? They were all full. The answer was that they were the same kind of people. The difference was that the magistrates could point to a number of cases where children had been put into local authority care but when the local authorities tried to deal with them at home they came up before the courts again. They claimed that that meant that the care order was useless. It means no such thing. There are many occasions when magistrates have imposed fines yet the offenders have come up again. Whenever one uses a non-custodial sentence, it is always possible that there might be re-offending. But it is also perfectly possible that re-offending might occur when a custodial sentence has been imposed. It is mythology to assume that, because a magistrate can now determine—as he once could —that a child should be sent to an institution away from home, that will improve the situation. I doubt whether that will be the result of the clause, and I therefore discount most of the argument for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not true to say that community homes have not been used. They were used, and people were put in them. If magistrates can send people to community homes—or at least bar them from being sent home and therefore oblige the social services departments to send them to residential homes— what will happen to those that were already being sent there because they thought that that was the appropriate way to deal with them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the argument that the proposal will cost only £6 million is a severe under-estimate of the cost if, in fact, magistrates have the right to determine that certain children should go to the homes and the social service departments still want to send to them the sort of people that they have been sending in the past. If that is the position, why are we bothering to deal with this residential care order? It is partly to soothe the amour-propre of the magistrates, but partly also to give the impression that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0325">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>343</span>
the Government are getting tough with young criminals—the same sort of pretence as the short, sharp shock detention centres, which were never anything of the kind and did nothing to deal with the problem of juvenile crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Juvenile crime is best dealt with in the context of the treatment of the" child as a whole and of the family from which the child comes as a whole. In that sense, social service departments are better able to make that assessment. I am as critical of some social workers as anybody in the House. We all know that there are social workers whose judgment leaves something to be desired. But, as a totality, it is better to deal with a young offender in that context because magistrates sitting on the bench, seeing the child only when he comes before the court—even with the benefit of a social service inquiry report—cannot have the benefit of a totality of judgment based upon long experience of the child, where he comes from, what his habits are, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that sense, the system that we have is a better system. I have fought hard to ensure that the magistrates would not have the power that they seek. I am perfectly willing to give the Minister his political point. The Labour Government resisted the proposal to the end, and I would continue to resist it if I were a Minister. It is, and always has been a nonsense. The Opposition may not carry the vote in the Committee, but we should carry the argument. When the measure is put into practice it will not result in any improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One point has been made to me by the Association of Directors of Social Services. I am advised that magistrates apparently want to use the care order under section 7 (7) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969, instead of using the full care proceedings under section 1 (2) (f). What usually happens in such circumstances is that the child comes before the court on the basis of an alleged offence. He is convicted and then sentenced using section 7 (7). I gather that the Directors of Social Services regard that as being an inadequate opportunity for the totality of the background of the child to be investigated, as it would be under section 1 (2) (f). If the residential care order is imposed, there should be some restriction on its use to make it a 1 (2) (f)— rather than a section 7—proceeding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speak only from advice. My experience of the juvenile court is so long past that I cannot assess the validity of that point. I put it to the Minister on the advice of those who are better able to deal with it than me and who have long experience of doing so. It may be a valid point that he might wish to consider. I do not ask him to respond immediately, but perhaps he could take official advice before Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The great fallacy that lies behind the opposition to the residential care order was succinctly exposed in the speech by the hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill), when she said that courts will be given the power to remove a child from home, which they cannot do at present. That
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>344</span>
is a fallacy because it ignores the fact that when they originally made the care order they had the power to ensure that the child went away from home, but declined to use it. It also ignores the fact that when a child returns to court, having committed a further offence while in the care of the local authority, it has the power to secure his removal from home, even if it is not minded to use it. That is the point. We are concerned only with circumstances where a child has committed a further offence while already in the care of the local authority, and we are concerned only with a court that, notwithstanding that further offence, wishes to give the child a non-custodial order. That is the whole point, and I had hoped that I had disposed of it in my earlier speech. The courts that make use of a residential care order will be determined not to send the child into custody, but to enable him to remain in the care of the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon) said that the clause is a sop to' the Magistrates' Association, to assuage their amour-propre, but that does not do justice to those servants of our community who deal with 97 per cent, of the criminal cases tried each year. We must consider their position when faced with a juvenile who has committed a further burglary in the community in which the magistrates live, and when they serve in their judicial capacity. What are they to do if they do not wish to send that youngster into custody? They know that the only present alternative is to renew the care order, unless they impose a fine that the youngster probably cannot pay. They will be faced with considerable criticism in the community. People will say " You made a care order last time, and look what happened. The local authority let him stay at home and he has committed burglary again—yet you impose only another care order. You are not up to your responsibilities." It is a question not of amour-propre but of enabling magistrates to do justice to the concept of not sending somebody into custody if it can be avoided, while keeping the confidence of the community in the local administration of the criminal justice system. That is the point. The fact that people who have come out of community homes are likely to re-offend does not bear upon the consideration at all. The question is whether we give magistrates a further non-custodial option, or whether, in the circumstances that I have described, we say " Sorry, you must put them into custody ".
