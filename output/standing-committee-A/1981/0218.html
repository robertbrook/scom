	<div class='title'>ORDERS FOR DETENTION OF MALE OFFENDERS AGED 14 TO 20</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [16 February</i>], No. 14, 	<i>in</i> page 3, line 39, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>" (5A) For the purposes of determining whether the detention of an offender in a detention centre would be unsuitable because of his mental or physical condition the court shall obtain and consider a report into his mental and physical condition "—[	<i>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</i>]</p></q></p>
	<p>10.31 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had virtually completed what I wanted to say and perhaps I can round it off. It is a general rule that all boys are examined by the detention centre's medical officer on arrival at a detention centre. This ensures that, where necessary, they may be excused from some or all of the physically demanding activities that constitute a normal part of the regime. Alternatively, activities such as physical education can be graduated to meet their fitness. Few of the boys sent to the pilot project dention centres have had to be referred to the detention centre hospital. The hospital facilities do not exist only to deal with persistent medical conditions—they are there to cater for the ordinary run of illness to which detention centre boys are no more immune that the rest of their age group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The detention centre system, like the rest of the prison system, must and does cope flexibly with a wide range of individuals. It is possible within the centre regimes to devise individual programmes involving light work and light physical education to cope with the less fit. So, while it is important that the courts should take into account the physical and mental condition of offenders in deciding whether a detention centre order is appropriate, it is important not to regard any mental assessment made before sentence as being the irrevocable last occasion upon which all depends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a question of coping with mistakes. After all, a boy diagnosed on sentence as fully capable of meeting the full demands of a detention centre at a medical examination which took place before his sentence may quite well subsequently develop a condition that renders him unsuitable. The system must be sufficiently flexible to cope with such changes without damage to the individual, and it is designed with this need firmly in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr- Kilroy-Silk) gave figures on Tuesday of boys transferred from
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>148</span>
detention centres on physical grounds and I am told that they amount to less than 7 per cent, of those received under the pilot project, to which he referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the point that I have already made of the undesirability of remanding more young people than is necessary to either remand centres or adult prisons for the purpose of medical examinations, it may help the Committee to know that in 1980 1,863 persons aged under 21 were remanded in custody for medical reports. Of that number, 1,524 were held in remand centres and 339 in local prisons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the numbers of young people remanded for that purpose be kept to the minimum. In particular, of course, the court may be minded to impose a very short period of detention centre custody of three weeks, and it could well be that the entire custodial period would be taken up, having regard to remission, in the time spent on remand for medical examination. I must therefore advise the Committee and my hon. Friends to resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dulwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that on this amendment the Minister was almost at his least persuasive. On his last point about remanding young people in custody, we accept that that should be done as little as possible. However, one of the complaints that many of us have about the existing system is that far too many people are remanded in custody for medical and similar reports who need not be remanded in custody and in respect of whom a report could perfectly well be obtained without remanding them in custody. Courts are much too prone to take that step and, particularly now that we are to have the detention centre sentence as a very short sentence, it seems—to me at any rate— to be even less necessary in many cases that the remand should be in custody. The defendant can certainly be released on bail in order that the examination should take place, if indeed it has not already taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the second point which is one of considerable force in opposition to what the Minister has said. We are already in a position, by virtue of clause 1 (6), that the court is required to do two things before passing any custodial sentence at all, whether a detention centre or a youth custody sentence. It must consider information about the circumstances and take into account any information before the court that is relevant to the boy's character and his physical and mental condition. We debated earlier whether that wording was sufficient, and it was the view of many of my hon. Friends and myself that, in so far as there is any ambiguity about how far circumstances extend, that ambiguity should be removed so that there is clearly a positive duty on the court to inquire into the physical and mental condition of the defendant before a custodial sentence is passed, including a detention centre order. We then have a positive duty in clause 2 which requires that a court should not send an offender to a detention centre if it considers that his detention in such a centre would be unsuitable because of his mental or physical condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0218">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>149</span>
The court is already required to obtain information about the circumstances, to take into account information about the mental and physical of the defendant, and debarred from sending a young offender to a detention centre if it considers that that would be unsuitable because of his mental or physical condition. Yet die Minister is demurring at the idea that a positive duty should be imposed upon the court to make quite clear that the combination of all those things must necessarily mean that the court should obtain information from a proper source, medical or otherwise, as to his mental or physical condition. I cannot follow the logic of the Minister's demurring to what seems to follow inevitably on the provisions that are already in the Bill. I could have understood his reply better if he had said that it was not necessary to have it because —	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Kilroy-Silk	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ormskirk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Dean. Is it not normal courtesy for the Minister, when having to determine whether an amendment is reasonable, to listen to the arguments that are being deployed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter for the Minister and not for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister is listening carefully with one of his ears to what I have to say, while using the other for other purposes, and am sure that he understands the point that I am making. He might almost have said that the amendment is unnecessary, because it is bound to be done anyhow, instead of which he has said that we must not have it because it would impose delay, as it would cause some people to be remanded in custody who might otherwise not have been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was astonished to hear that reply, because I had hoped that this action would inevitably be taken by a court, at least by a court that felt that it needed to comply with its duty, which seems to be, if not quite expressed, implicit in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman. I had already said, at the conclusion of our last sitting, albeit perhaps a little more shortly than the right hon. and learned Gentleman,
	<br><q><p>" that the courts must be relied upon to some extent to satisfy themselves that they have the information that they need to come to a proper decision ".—	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 16 February 1982; c. 144.]</p></q>
Wrapped up in that proposition was, of course, the statutory provision contained in the Bill to which the right hon. and learned Gentleman has just referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to hear that, but it is in direct conflict with the other point the Minister made—that to do so is undesirable because it would impose delay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that we get this right. In most cases the courts will have the benefit of submissions made to them on behalf of the offender, where they are contemplating sending a young offender into custody. Of course, if there is known to be a medical or mental condition, that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>150</span>
will form part of the submissions made. That will be the vast majority of cases. I am saying that to apply, as it were, belt and braces and require in every case a medical examination would lead to the undesirable consequences to which I drew attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nonetheless, it is provided as a positive duty for the court not to send a person to a detention centre if it considers that his detention would be unsuitable because of his mental or physical condition. That is a duty on the court. It ought not to be a duty which the court complies with only if the defendant, who may or may not be represented, or adequately represented. Indeed, he may only be represented at the very last minute, without the preparation about which I was speaking earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not at all satisfactory that, faced with that positive duty in the Bill, a court should be able to rely on the defence's not having brought forward something that may be relevant to the performance of that duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough to say that the court, if it considers that his detention would be unsuitable for certain reasons, complies with its duty if it gives no consideration to that matter in the absence of the defence having brought forward evidence that bears upon it. That is not, in my view, consistent with the philosophy that requires a court to consider information about the circumstances and so on, where a custodial sentence is to be passed, yet in the case of a detention centre order no such requirement is placed upon it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would not be offensive to any court—certainly not to a magistrates' court, possibly, in view of the provisions of the Bill, not to a higher court, and certainly not to one of the lower courts—if a provision that is wholly consistent with other provisions already in the Bill, were inserted to make it quite clear what the obligation of the court is. I really do not think that in the vast majority of cases it would be likely to cause delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If as a result of such a provision even one person were not submitted to a detention centre order who ought not to be, that would justify such a provision. It is not sufficient to say that they are medically examined when they reach the detention centre, because by that time the sentence has been passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an intervention on the last occasion I asked my hon. Friend if he knew what would happen to them if, as a result of that medical examination, they were found to be unsuitable. When I asked what the effect would be, he intimated that we were talking about someone being unsuitable for a detention centre, not a particular type of detention centre but a detention centre. I do not know what would happen to him. He could not in those circumstances be sent to another detention centre, because that would be wholly inconsistent with the finding that his medical condition was unsuitable for it. I really do not know what would happen, and the Minister has not told us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>151</span>
I suggest the Minister could properly accept the amendment, or at least the principle of it. If we are to have the sort of opposition that he has displayed to an amendment of this kind, I fear that the proceedings of the Committee will be unduly protracted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Shirley Summerskill	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to improve on the speech of my right hon. and learned Friend, but there are certain points that I should like to emphasise. First, I am aware that when a Minister at the Home Office brings a Bill through Committee, the brief on every amendment has in large letters at the top the word " Resist".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remember.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a formidable word to be faced with as one turns page after page, and one has to train oneself occasionally to resist the resistance of the brief, and acknowledge the points made by the Opposition. I agree with my right hon. and learned Friend that this is an amendment where I feel that the resistance should be resisted by the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that the hon. Lady's recollection can be quite so faulty from her long and distinguished time in the Home Office— distinguished in this sphere, incidentally—by a total lack of legislation on the lines that we are contemplating here over four years of office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a little hard to indicate this. It is true that a Green Paper was introduced in December 1978, but does the hon. Lady not accept that in the course of our proceedings I have on three amendments indicated my willingness to consider them? I think that she is being perhaps a little harsh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman's willingness to consider means putting down an amendment on Report. Willingness to consider, as I know, makes no positive commitment that the matter will be considered on Report. It simply, means that he will think about it, and talk about it, and probably bring the Bill back exactly the same on Report. We have not had an agreement to table an amendment on Report, let alone an amendment accepted in Committee, which was perhaps expecting too much. However, it would be pleasant to have a simple amendment tabled on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far, in practice, we have had no specific commitment from the Minister that he will accept any of our suggestions, only that he will consider them. This is an amendment that I feel he could accept. As my right hon. and learned Friend said, it follows naturally from the provision already in the Bill in clause 2(5)(a). The Bill already states that no court shall make an order for the detention of an offender in a detention centre—
	<br><q><p>" if it considers that his detention in such a centre would be unsuitable because of his mental or physical condition ".</p></q>
As far as I know, this provision was put in because the conditions and regime in a detention centre are such that they could not be detrimental
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>152</span>
to some boys in some circumstances—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It would be nice if the Minister could just listen to one of our speeches in its entirety with both ears, and not just with one ear. If he wants to receive instructions or advice could he receive them in the written, rather than in the oral form. That is the usual practice when getting advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The detention centre has been shown in the Bill to be a possible threat to the mental and physical wellbeing of some offenders. That is why this provision is written in to the Bill and why the Government have seen fit to ensure that a court takes this into account. It follows that if a court is to take it into account, the Opposition amendment that
	<br><q><p>" the court shall obtain and consider a report into his mental and physical condition "</p></q>
should be accepted in order to see whether the person is unsuitable. The fact that it might, as the Minister said, impose a cumbersome potential requirement on the court that would contribute to delay and expense is not relevant, in view of the fact that the Bill agrees that this factor should be taken into consideration. The Minister said at the last sitting that some people, not a high proportion, would go to the detention centre who were not mentally or physically fit but that in most cases the court got it right. That was the expression he used. It would be better if the court got it right in every case. We have included in the Bill mental or physical conditions, because we know that these regimes can be hard and that they are a short, sharp shock in some centres—both a physical and mental shock. That is agreed and that is why this provision has been put in the Bill. We are simply following that, and ensuring that a report into the mental and physical conditions should be obtained. This seems to be the height of common sense, and I know that my hon. Friends would agree with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it rather surprising that the Minister should have responded to this reasonable and sensible amendment as he has done. The Opposition expected that he would be more forthcoming, not least in view of the provision already in the Bill in clause 2(5) (a), as both my hon. Friends have pointed out. We expected the matter to have been dealt with before we adjourned last Tuesday, instead of which the Minister has been yet again singularly unhelpful. As my right hon. and learned Friend said, he is not in any way contributing to the progress of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now go over the case again and shall quote —it will be necessary for me to do so at length— from the Home Office circular that I have just obtained from the Library. Before I do that let me point out that the Minister's major argument against the amendment is the point that he made on Tuesday last when he said:
	<br><q><p>" The amendment imposes a cumbersome procedural requirement on the court, which will not only contribute to delay and expense, but could result in the young offender being held in adult prisons before going into a detention centre. If he has to be remanded for a medical report, he may be sent to an adult prison." —	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 16 February 1982; c.144] </p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0220">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>153</span>
That is what the hon. and learned Gentleman said and, of course, the Opposition do not want that to happen. Nor do the Government. Indeed, I find it extraordinary that the Minister and his advisers should not be aware of what was in the Home Office Circular No. 179/1972 headed:
	<br><q><p>" Remand Practices—Medical Examination of Offenders to Determine Fitness for Detention Centre Training ".</p></q>
The circular tells the courts the ways in which they can have a medical report on an offender likely to be sentenced to a detention centre order without the necessity of having to remand him to an adult prison. The whole point and purpose of the circular issued by the Home Office was to prevent remands in custody of any description while medical reports were being obtained. The Committee should remember that this was issued before the new, rigorous, short, sharp shock regime at New Hall and Send— and now in the two further detention centres—was introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to quote from this circular because neither the Minister nor those advising him seem to be fully aware of what it says. Paragraph 2 says:
	<br><q><p>" Where the court is considering sending an offender for detention centre training but first requires a medical fitness report, the defendant is often remanded in custody to enable the examination to be made in prison. This procedure, as well as not being in the offender's own best interests, involves expense and delay both in keeping the offender in custody on remand and in conveying him to and from the court."</p></q>
That is fine. That is the point that the Minister is making today. The next sentence of that circular, issued by his Department in 1972, says:
	<br><q><p>" Arrangements have accordingly been considered for the medical examination of offenders to ascertain fitness for detention centre training to take place whilst the defendant is at the court for the hearing."</p></q>
It says there that arrangements have already been made for the examination to take place at the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister tells us now, 10 years later, that it might mean that some of the boys we want to be subject to a medical inquiry and report may have to be held on remand in custody, and held in adult prisons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3 of the circular goes on:
	<br><q><p>" The proposal is that where a court has in mind to send an offender to a detention centre, but considers it desirable to obtain evidence of the person's fitness for detention centre training, his case should be put back to enable a medical practitioner to examine the defendant and provide the court with a certificate of fitness."</p></q>
It goes on in paragraph 4:
	<br><q><p>" In general, Police Surgeons in their private capacity would be the most appropriate doctors to perform the examinations, since the scheme requires the attendance, at sort notice, of the medical practitioner to examine the defendant within the precincts of the court, or at an adjacent place (eg, a police station). After examination, the practitioner would provide the court with a certificate indicating the fitness or otherwise of the defendant for detention centre training. It is not intended that the practitioner should provide the court with a more extensive report on the defendant or that the doctor who performs the examination would be required to attend court to give evidence."</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>154</span>
What is wrong with that circular? That was issued in 1972. It said then that we really need to have medical reports on those who are likely to be subject to a detention centre order, but we do not want to have those reports if the result will be that those boys will be held on remand in custody, and certainly not if they are going to be held on remand in custody in adult prisons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we are proposing a new scheme wher-by these reports can be obtained quickly and effectively by means of examinations carried out in the court or in a police station, and it will not be necessary to have them in remand in custody. If that was possible in 1972, I want to know why it is not possible today and why it is not being carried out in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

I wonder whether at this stage the Minister, who I see is being advised further, wishes to intervene in the debate. No, he does not wish to make a further contribution. In that case the Opposition have no option—in view of what the Minister has said and the overwhelming case put by the Opposition, with no one speaking against the amendment but the Minister himself—but to force the amendment to' a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><q><p>" and in any such case the court shall state the circumstances which appear to it to warrant the making of such an order."</p></q>
The Minister, from the announcement that he has just made, is anxious to give the Committee the maximum possible time to consider the amendments and the new clauses, which can be the only possible reason for his making the announcement at this stage. None the less, I intend to be my usual concise and brief self in moving this amendment. In order to do so, I have to draw the attention of the Committee to a point which I made in an earlier debate. It is that the Minister has in the Bill, I think for the first time, clear guidelines—more than
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>156</span>
guidelines; requirements, or outlines at least—about the sort of person that Parliament considers ought to be or ought not to be sent to a detention centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Up till now, I have been puzzled to know what sort of person Government policy considered should be embraced by the detention centre regime. My puzzlement became even greater when the Home Secretary introduced his short, sharp shock regime. On occasions, I have asked him and other Home Office Ministers for their criteria, and the answers have not suggested that they have a very clear picture. But now the picture emerges, leaving aside the mental or physical condition of the young person concerned. We have just been discussing that. It appears from subsection 	<i>(5)(b)</i> that it is not intended that a hardened offender, or indeed even one who, though not in the category of hardened offender, has at some time served a custodial sentence of any length, should be given a detention centre order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apparently, for this purpose we are to deal with those young offenders who either come before the court for a first offence or in circumstances that previous offences have not resulted in a custodial order. We are not dealing here, therefore, with the hardened offender type of youngster, and I assume that the purpose of the detention centre regime envisaged by the Government is to provide a sudden, sharp and perhaps very short corrective—if that is the right word to use—to a young person who commits an offence which is sufficiently serious. Presumably it is hoped that a taste of the regime will deter him and others who may fear such a regime from embarking upon a life of crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems to be the general philosophy, and I hope that the Minister will not only confirm that but enlarge upon it, because it is a most important question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Lyell(Hemel Hempsead)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to follow the right hon. and learned Gentleman's argument—the fault is probably mine—but we are dealing with Amendment No. 15 to subsection (6), which seems to deal principally with an offender who has been given some sort of custodial sentence before under subsection (5). In those circumstances, while I would not say that we are dealing with a hardened offender, are we not dealing with someone who has been in prison, detention or borstal before? If the right hon. and learned Gentleman could clarify that, I should be obliged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, since the right hon. and learned Gentleman was a most distinguished Minister in the previous Government, could he say briefly why he thought it right to have detention centres during that period?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>M. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said when I embarked upon this discussion, it was necessary, in order to deal with my amendment, to look at the background of it. The background that I am looking at is what I assume to be the general principle before we come to the special circumstances in which that general principle may, in some cases, be departed from by the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0222">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>157</span>
One cannot intelligently discuss special circumstances unless one is first aware of ordinary circumstances against which the special circumstances are to be judged. That is why I have been labouring this, and it is important so that we may know what the special circumstances are and what the Government's general policy is about sending young people to detention centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could have had a formal amendment to leave out subsection 	<i>(5)(b)</i> and had an additional debate on that. It seemed to me when I was considering putting down such an amendment that that would only result in two debates on much the same subject and that it was better to have the debate on this one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very important question, and again I invite the Minister to elaborate on the Government's thinking. As I have said, I have tried in the past to discover that, but now we have an opportunity in the form of the Bill, and it is important that we know just how the Government envisage the detention centre regime working, particularly in the context of the short, sharp shock characteristics of some detention centres and the different characteristics of others, and the possibility that the short, sharp shock regime will be extended possibly to all of them. We want to know about these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Lyell) asked what sort of person I had in mind, in the past, for a detention centre order. I can only say that I never considered that a detention centre was of any value. During the five years that I was privileged to act as a borough recorder, I cannot recall ever sending a young person to a detention centre. I am not convinced that they provide a suitable method of dealing with young persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During an earlier debate, I said that the original purpose of detention centres was to provide a short, sharp shock. As time went on, it was considered that that really was an unsuccessful and unsatisfactory method of dealing with the young offender, and the centres became rather different from that, with the original maximum period being increased to allow training and that type of thing to take place in them. But my view is that they have always been unsatisfactory, and we have now come full circle back to the short, sharp shock idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In subsection (6), an exception is provided for the limitations in subsection (5). Subsection (6) provides that a court may make a detention centre order even if the offender is within the limitations imposed by subsection 	<i>(5)(b)</i> if it appears that there are special circumstances, whether in relation to the offence or to the offender, which warrant making such an order in his case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I am wholly puzzled about the sort of special circumstances relating to the offender—indeed relating also to the offence, having regard to the alternative of youth custody—the Government have in mind in making that proposal in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>158</span>
What sort of person do they regard as suitable for a detention order, even though he may by virtue of subsection 	<i>(5)(b)</i> be normally debarred from being sentenced. It is certainly not clear on the face of the Bill what kind of person is likely to be embraced by that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government use the expression " special circumstances ". Those of us familiar with another branch of criminal law know that " special" in that context has a special meaning; I do not know whether the Government intend that there should be the same meaning in the case of this provision or whether " special" in this case means no more than out of the ordinary. I assume that that is so and that they do not intend to apply some highly technical meaning to the word " special".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that " special " means that there are circumstances out of the ordinary which justify the making of an order in the case of a person otherwise barred from going to a detention centre. It is very important that we know what out of the ordinary circumstances the Government may have in mind. I am not inviting the Minister to give a long category; clearly, he cannot. But we are entitled to know the Government's general approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are embarking on a new approach to the detention centre by virtue of the limitations imposed by subsection 	<i>(5)(b),</i> which are not the sort of limitations which in the past courts would have been likely to consider appropriate to using the detention centre as a punishment. Then we have this exception, which must apply to a very limited category, to which the courts are asked to have regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of those circumstances and the very considerable difficulties which the courts will experience in deciding how to apply the special circumstances provision of subsection (6), the amendment would require the court to give its reasons and state the circumstances which appeared to it to warrant making an order. If a duty is imposed upon the court to do that, at least one advantage will result. The court will have to apply its mind specifically to the difficult problem which it will face. The result of that application of its mind to the problem will be that higher courts will see the way in which the minds of the lower courts are acting and, if they approve, they will be able to say so. If they thing that the courts are departing from the right principles, equally they will be able much more easily to lay down guidelines for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the subsection is left on the basis merely that it is sufficient for the court to say that it appears that there are special circumstances, which might relate to the offence or might relate to the offender, the court—in particular, the lower court and the Crown Court also—is not likely to concentrate its mind so clearly upon the very special problem which will obviously arise about subsection (6). Certainly it is very unlikely, even if it gives reasons of some kind, to give them in a sufficiently clear and concise way as to enable the higher courts quickly to provide the sort of guidance which will obviously be necessary for this part of the clause to be effective in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0223">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>159</span>
I anticipate that circumstances will be very rare when it should be operated, and that is why the Government have used the term " special circumstances ". There is plainly a danger that it might not be operated uniformly or in the right way, and the amendment would help to ensure that it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the Government feel that my anxieties are greater than warranted or that the help that I suggest would be given to the courts by the amendment is exaggerated, it is difficult to see that the addition of the words that I suggest or some such words could possibly do any harm. It is difficult to see that they are out of line with many of the other provisions of the Bill where a requirement is made for the courts to explain what they are doing. Therefore, as I believe there was in the case of the last amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk), here is an opportunity for the Government to recognise that what the Opposition are trying to do is not to delay but to improve the Bill and that the most effective way of doing so is to accept the amendment or, at the very least, to say that they will come back with an amendment on Report which gives effect to these difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept entirely the spirit of what the right hon. and learned Gentleman has just said about the nature of the interventions that he and his hon. Friends have made so far, and I certainly would not allege that any such intervention has been with the purpose of delaying the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been genuine disagreements, and no doubt there will be again, about the extent to which it is desirable in legislation to require all courts to give specific reasons why they choose to avail themselves of exceptions to the general rule that are made in legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I respond to the right hon. and learned Gentleman's request for an explanation of the purpose of detention centres. While what I say is bound to be construed with the accuracy that one construes a statute, the general purpose can be said to be to provide a custodial regime that is suitable for a young offender for whom custody up to a maximum of only four months and to a minimum, under the terms of the Bill, of as little as three weeks is considered to be appropriate by the court in circumstances in which no non-custodial sentence is considered appropriate. They are not, therefore, suitable for a sophisticated or a hardened offender, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman correctly supposes. Therefore those who have served custodial sentences of a different type already are generally excluded in the Bill. The intention is that there should be a two-week programme based on work, basic education, physical education, parades and inspections, and this makes sure that there is a structured regime for those with very short sentences. All of us in this Committee agree that there is a desirable reform, made in the Bill in its provision for very short custodial sentences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those with longer sentences, the two-week programme will be followed by a different mix and a wider range of occupations. These will, for ex-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>160</span>
ample, include work with a greater element of skill, a broader educational programme and possibly basic trade training courses. This regime is designed to cater for relatively unsophisticated offenders, for whom only a short custodial sentence is thought necessary. That is why this subsection proposes that it shall generally be a bar to a detention centre order that somebody has been sentenced previously, for example, to youth custody or to imprisonment. But it is, in my experience, almost always unwise to prevent courts from taking account of special circumstances. This subsection allows a court to say that, nothwithstanding that the offender has actually served a term in youth custody some considerable time ago or, let us say, borstal, there may be circumstances in which it is appropriate for him, because he has to go to custody, to serve a sentence at a detention centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. and learned Gentleman was perfectly fair in asking what kind of examples we had in mind. It would probably be used where the strict application of subsection (5) operated unfairly. Such a case might arise where the earlier sentence was passed for an offence committed in very different circumstances, or the provision could have some value where a court was dealing with more than one defendant and wanted to make distinctions between the sentences imposed on each of them. One illustration that one could conjure up is that a boy could have had four months' youth custody at the age of 15, went straight until he was 19 and then committed an offence for which a custodial sentence was alone appropriate. But having regard to all the circumstances, in the view of the court four weeks in a detention centre, let us say, would be appropriate for that subsequent offence. It ought, we think, to be open to the second court in those circumstances to take the view that the 19-year-old was not really a hardened and sophisticated offender, and indeed it would be plain that in most cases he was not a hardened and sophisticated offender, given his history, and that a detention centre would be best for him, notwithstanding the earlier sentence of youth custody or borstal. It is right that there should be provision for such flexibility in the application of the general principle which itself is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I go back to what I said at our last sitting, that it is generally unwise to put courts into a strait-jacket and oblige them to specify the reasons for an exception to a general rule such as this being applied. I do not think that it is necessary. This is an opportunity for a court to deal more leniently than the application of the general rule permits. The application of the general rule, given that a custodial sentence for the second offence is thought to be necessary, would mean youth custody. But here the subsection would permit, in these exceptional circumstances, the courts to say that, notwithstanding that an offender has been in youth custody previously and that the application of the general rule laid down by Parliament would require him to be sent to youth custody again—that is to say, a minimum of four months—we believe that it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0224">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>161</span>
proper in these circumstances for the offender to be treated more leniently with four weeks—to take the example that I gave—in a detention centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, I do not believe that it is necessary to spell out in the statute that the courts must give their reasons. I would regard it differently, possibly, if we were giving them power to apply a more severe sentence than would the application of the general rule. I appreciate the way in which the right hon. and learned Gentleman has placed it but I do not think this would be a necessary and desirable increase to the statutory provisions of the Bill, and I advise the Committee to resist it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since it should be a consideration that people should not serve long sentences unnecessarily, in principle it is useful to have an exception to the general rule that persons who have served a prison sentence should not go to a detention centre, so that in exceptional circumstances such a sentence may nevertheless be made. If that power did not exist, courts which came to the conclusion that a lad of 19 ought to have a custodial sentence would give him a youth custody sentence of greater length. The power should assist in keeping our prisons from being overcrowded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The drafting of the clause indicates clearly to a court what the general intention of the legislature is, but gives the court the opening to give a sentence of, in effect, less than four months rather than more than four months for someone who has already served a custodial sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment does not seek to alter those main proposals. All it seeks to do is to ask the judges to stipulate why they have done it. I believe that to a nervous, deputy circuit judge, for example, that could be an inhibition against giving a sentence of less than four months because, once a reason has been given, it has to be considered whether it will stand up in the Court of Appeal. To that extent some people on the Bench might take the view that it is safer to give a longer sentence—a youth custody sentence—rather than make a detention centre order simply to avoid any trouble, to avoid appeal and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, where the intention is to reduce sentencing of young persons, I believe we should be reluctant to create a superstructure which may inhibit shorter sentencing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, I have had great difficulty in finding the sort of case where the exception would operate and that means that this exception will be used sparingly. But where it is used, it will be used to keep a young person out of prison for a long time, rather than put him into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the effect of the clause will mean that second offenders will be put into custody when otherwise they might be allowed to leave court without a custodial sentence. I believe that the exception will be used but rarely and, when it is used, to reduce the period that a young person will spend in custody. My only anxiety about the general rule is that if a person who has been in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>162</span>
prison is put into a detention centre he could have a bad effect on those around him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances, therefore, I should not wish to put an inhibition on courts making a detention centre order, for otherwise someone could be sent to prison for six months or so under a youth custody order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did his best in explaining what the Government have in mind and I agree with the hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons) in two respects. First, that the subsection is likely to be very rarely used and, secondly, that if it is to be used for the purpose of reducing the length of the sentence rather than for some other purpose, that is to be welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I find a little difficult, however, about that concept and the Minister's reply, which gave it as an example—one of the two examples he gave—is his reply to an intervention of my own on the last occasion we discussed this, when I asked him
	<br><q><p>" Could he answer a question which genuinely puzzles me and which arises both from our previous debates and from he has just said. Which type of sentence, apart from the question of length, does he consider to be more serious, a detention centre sentence or a youth custody sentence? Assuming that the length of the period were on equal terms between the two, does he regard one as being a graver penalty than the other. If so which, and for what reason?"</p></q>
His reply was:
	<br><q><p>" I do not think they are to be measured in terms of gravity. I believe that they are to be measured in terms of what is appropriate. The detention centre sentence is characterised by its particular regime. It is also to be characterised by the fact that it will have a maximum of four months."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A</i>; 16 February 1982; c. 138.]</p></q>
So, he is saying that a particular regime is suitable for one type of person or offence—a detention centre regime rather than a youth custody type of regime— which may be suitable for another. If that is the way the Government are looking at the matter, it is difficult to fit into that picture—that of a court saying that it would normally sentence a young person to, say, six months youth custody but, wanting to be lenient, it sentences him to four months in a detention centre instead, where he will enjoy a different type of regime referred to by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To my mind, that only increases the difficulty. I agree that we should have a subsection (6) because there should be the occasional special case, but it increases the difficulty of the courts having a pattern or guidelines to operate. They read what the Minister said on Tuesday and then they read what he said this morning, and they might be somewhat confused as to how they are to operate the subsection and, in any event, they probably will not read either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They may or may not receive guidelines from the Home Office but in my view it would be much better if they could have a method written into the Bill under which the courts would produce their own guidelines. That is all the amendment asks for. The courts would formulate their reasons, a High Court would consider them and in time it may be that the Lord Chief Justice would say, as he has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>163</span>
done in relation to other matters, that these considerations ought to be applied and others ought not to be applied. It seems to me that the Minister has not made a case for suggesting that this requirement ought not to be written into the Bill even in the case of the magistrates' court, although I accept his general dislike of fettering the courts' general discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to press the amendment to a vote. I would rather adopt the words used by the Minister on so many occasions in the past and say that my hon. Friends and I will consider everything that has been said in the debate and decide what we should do at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>11.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had a debate on the merits of detention centres. It was made clear in a vote from this side of the Committee that we are opposed to detention centres full stop. This view was upheld by the Advisory Council on the Penal System, which drew upon evidence of the way the centres worked in the early 1950s and 1960s when they were first set up. We support, as did the advisory council, one sentence of youth custody and supervision. We have heard no evidence that the detention centres are effective, a deterrent to other young people, or that they prevent recidivism. On the contrary, the recidivism rate from the centres is very high. We have had no evidence of the effect of the recent short, sharp shock experiment. I understand that we will have to wait for that for another year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 refers only to male offenders and young people aged 14 to 20. I had hoped that the Bill would take the opportunity to make sentencing simple and remove anomalies. The youth custody sentence and supervision which, in our view, should replace this provision would make for simpler administration and would be the common sentence for boys and girls. We oppose detention centres for any age and sex. We consider that they are no more appropriate for a boy than for a girl. My learned Friend the Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) made this point when he asked the Minister why, if detention centres are accepted as unsuitable for girls, they should be thought suitable for boys of the same age? The hon. and learned Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve) pointed out that the peak age for girls to commit this type of offence is 14, whereas it is 15 for boys who find themselves in detention centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the issue raised by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dulwich. He asked the Minister what characterises these centres and why courts send people to them. The Minister confirmed that they are characterised by the regime. Yet when he was dealing with the point that they are considered suitable and appropriate only for boys and not girls, he said that girls do not commit offences as often as boys. He was saying
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>164</span>
that it was the numerical figure of girls who committed offences as opposed to the number of boys.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that more boys do offend. But the point of sending people to these centres is not because there is a totally high number of boys committing this type of offence; we are told that it is because of a regime. The evidence shows that the regime is not appropriate or suitable, and therefore it follows that detention centres for boys are as inappropriate as they are for girls. Therefore we say that clause 2 should not stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. A. Trippier	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rossendale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned that clause 2(3) creates a minimum order of 21 days for detention in a dentention centre. It conflicts with clause 2(2), which allows a court to specify that the maximum term of detention is to be the same as the maximum term of imprisonment. Certain offences under the Town Police Clauses Act 1847 provide a maximum term of imprisonment of 14 days. Clause 2(3) will extend this to 21 days.

My hon. and learned Friend the Minister of State is aware that the minimum term of youth custody is, with certain exceptions, set at four months. This could lead to young offenders spending longer in custody that at present. The philosophy that the young offender has little to gain from more than one period in a detention centre will have to change to allow for repeated orders if the court wishes to pass a custodial sentence of less than four months. Can my hon. and learned Friend assist me in this regard?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to intervene but now that the Minister has put us on notice that there is more time at our disposal, it seems only reasonable to take advantage of it. Like my hon. Friend, I regret the retention of detention centres as provided by clause 2. I welcome the availability of shorter sentences. I do not particularly wish to see young boys sentenced to detention centres, but if they are to be given such a sentence it seems sensible and reasonable that they should be sentenced to as short a sentence as possible. Therefore it is eminently desirable that this part of the Bill enables the courts to pass a shorter sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that even that will be effective in reducing recidivism. The Minister has not indicated the Government's intention in giving the courts the power to pass shorter sentences. I am not sure what they hope to achieve. My fear, which has been expressed in Committee and referred to many times outside, is that the availability of the power to pass shorter sentences now given to the courts may mean that a larger number of boys will end up in detention centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that that is not the Government's intention. It is certainly not the intention of the Opposition. We share the Government's view that far too many people, particularly juveniles, are given custodial sentences. We share the Government's view that it is desirable and necessary to reduce the number of adults, young people and juveniles who are given custodial sentences.

As my right hon and learned Friend the Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) has pointed out, we wish to do everything to assist the Government in the Bill by means of amendments to improve it which will have the result of reducing the prison population and those held in custodial establishments. It is my fear, the fear of my hon. and right hon. Friends, and the fear of the prison and borstal governors branch of the Society of Civil and Public Servants and of the National Association of Probation Officers and others that one of the consequences of passing clause 2 will be an increase in the number of boys given detention centre sentences. And that would be regrettable, particularly if those individuals would otherwise have been given a non-custodial sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be regrettable because, as has been pointed out by many of my right hon. and hon. Friends, detention centres are not effective in reforming and rehabilitating those sentenced to them. Indeed, there is some evidence that seems to suggest that it leads them on to rather than deters them from a life of criminality. Therefore, if indeed the evidence suggests that detention centres far from making a constructive contribution to the reform or rehabilitation of young people, actually increases the likelihood of their committing further offences, that is an added reason why we would not wish to see more younger boys being sentenced to detention centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that 76 per cent, of those sentenced to detention centres are reconvicted within two years of having been released, and that clearly demonstrates what my hon Friend the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) said about the failure of detention centres. They are recognised, acknowledged, accepted failure, certainly in trying to achieve that single objective. If we measure them by the criterion of whether or not young people sentenced to detention centres lead useful, constructive and law-abiding lives when they are released, clearly they do not achieve that admittedly desirable and shared objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As he will know even better than I, most offenders who start as young offenders reform some time after the age of 21 and get married and settle down.

Do they tend to go on to longer-term lives of crime, or do they tend to reform like everybody else? Or has he no information?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no information here available now, but the clear evidence is that most of those who go to detention centres commit further offences, end up in borstal, end up in young prisoner establishments and end up in prison.

Many of them, go from one institution to another, which demonstrates clearly the failure of so-called residential or institutional care, whether it be in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>166</span>
local authority homes or penal establishments, to deal effectively with the real problems of both juveniles and young offenders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon Friend aware that, in the view of at least one very experienced prison governor, the most effective form of rehabilitation is to reach the age of 35, and that statistics bear that out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what my right hon. Friend says. It is true that most of the young people who offend in one way or another—and most of them commit offences of a trivial nature and are not often caught—do not continue committing offences throughout their adult life. But for the small minority of offenders who find themselves in detention centres and who are recidivists, the evidence seems to bear me out that a substantial proportion of them find their way inevitably and consistently through the penal system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the shorter sentences, though I express the fear that the result may be that more boys will end up in detention centres. I regret very much the retention of detention centres and deplore wholeheartedly the introduction and extension of the so-called short, sharp shock experiment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not quite sure what the Government actually expect to achieve as a result of the introduction of the short, sharp shock experiment, or the new regime of drill, parades and inspections that was first introduced—allegedly, any way—in the New Hall and Send detention centres in April 1980, and which has now been extended to two further detention centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure what the Government really expect will be the result in recidivists rates or in anything else, except perhaps, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dulwich indicated during a previous debate, as a cosmetic public relations exercise—first, to appease the backwoodsmen in the Tory Party in Parliament and, secondly, the backwoodsmen in the Tory law-and-order lobby outside. It does not seem to have a real constructive element for dealing with the problems of the young offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will know that it is not a new experiment. The term " short, sharp shock" was applied when detention centres were first introduced as a result of the Criminal Justice Aot 1948, and when they were employed in 1952 that same expression was used—short, sharp shock. A tough, punitive regime was then established and it was clearly shown and demonstrated, not least by the staff of those institutions, that they themselves did not like and were not prepared to implement the short, sharp shock of the tougher regime that was then currently in vogue. Neither did it have any real beneficial effects in dealing with the problems and the likely criminal propensities of the young offenders. That is one of the reasons why a more constructive approach in the detention centres gradually became the norm in the intervening period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are going back yet again to what is not a new experiment but which has already
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>167</span>
been tried and has been seen to have failed clearly and demonstrably. It is a nonsense again to experiment on children and young people in this barbaric, punitive and negative fashion when, in any event, all the evidence shows that a similar experiment has already been carried out and shown to be a monumental failure—certainly in view of the criterion which right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite seem to think the most important criterion of whether a particular offender is deterred by a custodial sentence from ever again having the temerity to commit criminal offences. As I have already said, the detention centres and the short, sharp shock have demonstrably failed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear of this evidence, to which the hon.

Could he inform the Committee as to where we could find that evidence, which would assist us in trying to solve the problem that he is talking about?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The evidence is of the kind I have just demonstrated, the evidence of the Home Office's figures of 76 per cent, recidivist rate within two years of release from a detention centre. That has been so ever since the detention centres were introduced in 1952, when the short, sharp shock was employed in that year and when the new tougher regimes were introduced. All the way through it has been shown that the numbers of those committing first offences have not been reduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Gentleman would mention the 76 per cent., which he has done many times in the Committee. Could it be that the figure was so high because the short, sharp shock sentence was not short and sharp enough?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman wants to cut off their hands. No doubt he does. I know that he and his hon. Friends, judging from the amendment they tabled on corporal punnishment, seem to get heavily turned on by all the details of the length, the size and the shape of the whip and the taws. That type of thing does not turn me on as it so obviously does Conservative Members. Certainly, it does not have the effect on offenders that they seem to suggest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, if the hon. Gentleman wants another figure related to his more barbaric manner of dealing with young offenders, let us look at the experience of birching in the Isle of Man. We will find that the figure is not much different from the 76 per cent. In fact, 75 per cent, of those who have been birched commit further offences within two years. So even the more barbaric measures that the hon. Gentleman presumably would like to introduce do not achieve the objective that he and I share.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee, but if the hon. Gentleman wants to talk about the Isle of Man he must know that since the birch was withdrawn crime rates have risen. I am sure that that is a fact of which he is aware.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>168</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may well have done, as it has in all European countries; we are no different from the others. But if we are talking about corporal punishment, let us look at when it was available in this country. For crimes or robbery with violence it was available before 1948. The Home Office has produced the evidence. It carried out three research studies on the incidence of crimes of robbery with violence while flogging was an option to the courts in this country and what happened after its abolition in 1948. The evidence showed clearly that the incidence of crimes of robbery with violence declined when flogging was not an option to the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked for evidence. The evidence is there if he cares to ask for it. It is not my evidence but that of the Home Office, the Department of Health and Social Security, and many other organisations. It shows clearly that whether it be the length of a prison sentence, the nature of the regime within the prison, or whether it be related to corporal punishment or birching, the more punitive the more negative, the more barbaric the punishment the less likely it is to affect recidivist rates and turn offenders on to a more constructive path. Therefore there is no real argument in favour of the short, sharp shock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have been asked repeatedly—and one would have thought they would have made an attempt to meet the request in the Committee—to provide figures of recidivist rates resulting from the introduction of their new, short, sharp, shock experiment. We all remember the manner in which the Home Secretary announced to the clamour of the Tory Party conference the introduction of this new short, sharp shock and how it would deal with young thugs, robbers and rapists. It was a claim which was wildly applauded. If that is the claim, one would expect the Government to have undertaken research studies to obtain the evidence of whether it is being realised and whether the experiment is reducing the level of criminality amongst those who have been subjected to it. Yet, in spite of repeated requests by myself and my hon. Friends, not least my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax, for such figures, the Government seem unable or perhaps unwilling to provide them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We suspect what perhaps the Government already know, that there is not likely to be any significant reduction in the propensity to crime amongst those people subjected to the short, sharp shock as compared to what happened previously. If that is the case, clearly it will be embarrassing to the Government. It will also demonstrate what we all knew and have argued, that such a punitive and destructive regime will not have the single, most desirable consequence sought by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More important than that is not just the fact that the Government's experiment is likely to be a failure but the knowledge shared by those outside the House who are dealing with young people at the sharp end, the probation officers, social workers and others, that the only real way to deal with the criminal or delinquent propensities of young people and of juveniles is to try to deal with their particular
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0228">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>169</span>
problems. We should not deal with their symptoms, as we are doing by the introduction of the short, sharp shock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know, for example, that many young people going to detention centres have not been convicted of violent offences. They are not, therefore, the muggers, robbers and rapists to which the Home Secretary alluded at the Tory Party conference. Indeed, about 1,500 of the boys entering detention centres in 1980 were first offenders and should not, according to our argument—largely accepted by the Minister of State—have been given a custodial sentence in any event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About 1,500 first-offender boys were subjected to the rigorous regimes of detention centres in 1980. We know, from the evidence of Sir Charles Backhouse, the medical officer of Send detention centre, and from others, that many boys in the detention centres are socially disadvantaged, physically and mentally unstable and psychologically and socially deprived. They are of low educational attainment. Significant proportions of the boys have reading ages of 10 years or below.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a picture, painted for us by the medical officer of a detention centre, and by the widely-researched reports from the Home Office research unit and the Department of Health and Social Security, of boys coming largely from broken homes. Their mothers or fathers are alcoholic, or in prison. There is a high incidence of homelessness, and they have had a long history of truancy from school. They have low educational attainments and a long history of physical neglect and mental instability. There is little opportunity to obtain training or education, or anything that may suit them to take a positive role in their community, and the society of which they are citizens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given such a picture, which is painted by all the researchers, we should embark upon a far more sensible and constructive approach in the Bill. The approach should as a minimum be connected to the education and training of those young people in social skills, so that they are able to fit into society, and become useful members of it. We find little or nothing of that in the Bill, certainly not in clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole concept of detention centres is wrong. That was acknowledged by the Children and Young Persons Act 1979, which enabled a future Government to end the use of detention centres. Their whole outlook with a regime of drill parades and inspections, is abhorrent to any who want to see the introduction of a decent, civilised, compassionate and humane penal system. It is more important, however, to recognise and to accept that we are far more likely to be successful in treating delinquent behaviour and dealing with criminal activities if we try to deal with these individuals in the community from which they have come and to which, eventually, they must be returned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is there that those young people have their problems, whether we like it or not. Many of them have serious and deep-rooted problems which must
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>170</span>
be resolved in the community, home, school, workplace or accommodation. At some stage, they must return to that school, community, family, school, or workplace, or to the homeless men's young person's daycare centre, or whatever it happens to be called.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those young people will not really be equipped for a return to civilian life, or be able to embark on constructive paid employment if they are put into detention centres, which is an unnatural, single-sex, closed world and an artificial environment. To subject them to a regime of marching up and down, obeying orders, standing to attention, having their clothes laid out in a particular well-prescribed fashion at the end of their beds does not equip them for a return to civilian life or give them the ability to embark on constructive, paid employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
At a time when nearly 4 million are unemployed, I have not yet heard of anyone advertising for boys of 16, 17 or 18 with experience of drill parade and inspections and the ability to lay out their clothes in a fashion prescribed, inch by inch.

have now been withdrawn and that we can now take a more relaxed attitude to the Committee proceedings. However, I suggest that we should oppose the retention of clause 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin:</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> I begin my brief remarks by saying how much I agree with the thrust of my hon. Friend's comments. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am aware that some Conservative Members have not been listening. I am not referring to the hon. and learned Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve), who just intervened from a sedentary position, but to some of his neighbours. Perhaps our words will reach a wider and more intelligent public than the one that appeared on the Government Benches today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In company with my hon. Friend, I find it extremely difficult—I have made it clear on several occasions—to understand the real purpose of the separation of methods of dealing with the young offender into two different " regimes "—I use the words that the Minister used earlier—the detention centre regime and the youth custody regime. I have already said on two occasions that I can see no reason why a youth custody regime could not be sufficiently broad and elastic to cover different methods of dealing with offenders. Such a broad regime, although I should not expect any part of that regime to be comparable with the type of regime that now exists in detention centres—certainly not the short, sharp shock section of the detention centre —ought to be variable enough to encompass different forms to deal with different types of young offenders, according to the study of the need of each of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have still not had a clear explanation even of the type of regime, let alone the type of person considered suitable for it. I am interested in the suggestion that it might be used as a recruiting ground for the Brigade of Guards. I am not sure whether that has the authority of those in charge of recruiting for that brigade, but I feel that perhaps they would not find it a profitable area of recruitment. Possibly that is not the purpose of this separation between the detention centre and the youth custody centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that the Bill does not contain any clue to that puzzle causes me to make this intervention. In clause 2—the point can also be made in regard to other clauses—a court is required to have regard to such matters as whether
	<br><q><p>" detention in such a centre would be unsuitable "</p></q>
because of the mental or physical characteristic of the offender and to consider other matters, apart from the mere question of length of sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nowhere in the clause, where one would expect to find it, is there anything that characterises what such a centre should be. Therefore, we do not know on what basis a court is to make its determination on the suitability or unsuitability of the detention centre regime—whether in relation to the mental or physical condition of the offender, or generally— in deciding whether to sentence an offender to that rather than to youth custody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a most extraordinary way of dealing with this dichotomy in the method of producing a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>172</span>
custodial regime for the young offender. We tell the courts that there are two separate regimes, we invite them to say what is suitable for one rather than the other, but we do not tell them what the regimes are or what sort of person is suitable for one rather than the other. We leave them to deduce that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That in itself is remarkable, but it becomes even more remarkable when we know that even within the detention centre system there are two different types of regime—the so-called short, sharp shock regime and the non-short, sharp shock regime. We are asking the courts to make a decision without giving them any guidance about whether the type of offence is suitable for short, sharp shock or non-short, sharp shock, let alone whether it is suitable for detention centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears, therefore, that there is a serious defect in the way in which the clause and the Bill are drafted. Our objection probably originates from the fact that those who understand the penal system have no faith in the likelihood that the dentention centre regime can be of any value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I and other Opposition Members said, the real reason for the retention of this dichotomy is 'that it satisfies those who bay at seaside conferences in October and make life difficult for a Home Secretary and Minister who, I am sure, have liberal instincts at heart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had the pleasure of contesting a general election against the Minister and was able to hear his views and attitudes at close quarters. I do not believe that either he or the Home Secretary has affection for or faith in the system that they are imposing on the courts. That is why I believe they inserted the clause in this form, talking simply about a detention centre without discretion or differentiation in its characteristics or in the type of person that is to be dealt with within the general system of youth custody. Therefore, I find this a pernicious clause and think it ought not to be in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One should look at the way in which the judiciary approaches the sentencing of young people. First, there is an unwillingness to send young people to prison or any other form of custody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, circumstances arise where, say a young person has had probation, has been fined two or three times, may have had a conditional discharge and is now before the court for other offences. The court takes the view that unless the offence for a young person is grave, it should not send that young person either to prison —on which in any event there have so far been restrictions—or to borstal. It says that he has had several chances, is still offending, is here for, let us say, three charges of shop breaking and must be given a custodial sentence. It does not consider the rival merits or demerits of detention centre or borstal. It says that he must now have a custodial sentence and the first rung on the ladder is a detention centre, so he should be sent there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were no detention centres or borstals, but simply youth imprisonment, the court might select a sentence of, say, nine months, but although it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0230">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>173</span>
might consider that an appropriate time, it would be inhibited from imposing it by the existence of these tiers of sentencing. It would know that unless the offence were grave, it should start with a detention centre. It would not consider what the detention centres regime was. It would think it the most lenient in the sense of being the shortest custodial sentence available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we remove the three-tier system, detention centre, borstal and prison, and replace it with a one-tier system for young people, that of youth custody—I do not mention what that will mean in practice—when the court decides that a custodial sentence is necessary, it will have no inhibitions about the length of time. It may select a time of nine or 12 months' youth custody. Were there a two-tier system, although the court thought 12 months appropriate, it would still choose a detention centre. The effect would be that the court would be giving a shorter sentence than if the detention centre sentence had not existed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, however wicked or unwise a detention centre regime, there is no doubt that if we do not have a two-tier system the courts will give longer sentences. They now feel obliged to stop at the detention centre option because they decide that the time has not come for the person to be sent to borstal or prison, and because the detention centre option is shorter, the young person is released earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The gravamen of the Opposition attacks has been that a detention centre is not a sensible way of dealing with young people. That may be right, but there is an argument for two different titles for custodial sentence for young people. The first should contain a time limit—in this case, four months. If we have one custodial sentence for the young without that four-month break, longer sentences will be imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not speaking in favour of detention centres but of what appears to be a two-tier system with a maximum sentence cut-off on the first tier, so that the court will feel obliged to sentence within that maximum. I have no doubt that courts which think nine months appropriate for a young person who has not previously had a detention sentence will give him, almost through their teeth, the first option which will be a maximum of four months. Otherwise they would give him more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. and learned Gentleman pursue the logic of that approach so far as to expect the courts, in which we are doing our best to place trust, when they make a detention centre order invariably to make one of the maximum of four months, or does he anticipate that they might in certain circumstances go to the minimum of 21 days? If they may do so, why does the hon. and learned Gentleman feel that they would be inhibited by having a single wide-ranging area of youth custody of between 21 days and 12 months and would force it into the straitjacket of two months?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>174</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyons</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because the judiciary has it firmly in its mind that a detention centre is the first custodial step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that many of those sitting on Benches passing sentence think much about what is involved in such a step. They have come to the conclusion that a sentence must be custodial, and from their point of view this is the shortest and the easiest that they can give, and that is the one which they must give before they move on to borstal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A court will say that it cannot send some young person to borstal because he has never been in custody before, but it will send him to a detention centre. That is the first step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am considering those offenders who will get four months, and who would otherwise, under a general youth custody scheme, nine or 12 months. The question of shorter sentences of less than four months is another matter. There is a serious danger that the 21-day sentence, which all the courts will realise is with remission a 14-day sentence, means that more people can be sent to a detention centre who would otherwise be treated non-custodially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the top end of the range there will be this cut-off of four months, just as there has been in the past with borstal. If in the past there had not been almost an obligation to send young persons to borstal rather than to prison, and had judges had discretion to fix sentences, in terms of the time spent in borstal there might have been longer sentences for those who went to borstal than they actually received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is useful to have a break for first custodial sentences of four months maximum, and if that is removed there will be longer sentences for those receiving first custodial sentences. Perhaps we should not have a detention centre regime, or perhaps we should call it something entirely different, but it is important to retain in the minds of the judiciary the fact that for a first-time custodial sentence there should be a maximum four months cut-off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trouble with the youth custody concept for everybody—calling it by the same name, that is, for all offenders—is that there is no restriction on the Bench. Courts will give what sentences they think proper, and in many cases that may be more than four months, whereas, if there were two tiers, they would feel obliged to give the first tier in every case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the aim is to increase the number of persons serving time in custody, the way to achieve it is to destroy the four months' cut-off period. It is not an argument in favour of detention centres but for the maintenance of a cut-off period of four months for nearly all those sentenced to a first custodial sentence. Otherwise, we shall put even greater strain upon our penal establishments that are already tremendously overcrowded. The whole system, is breaking down and we shall have to bear that factor in mind for the sake of the system as well as for the sake of those sentenced to custody—having regard to the fact that there is little evidence that custody in any form does anyone any good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting, if not entirely novel, debate on the principle of detention centres, and I should like to respond to as many as possible of the points that have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I start with a point that is technical and therefore, of a separate character from other points made in the debate. That is the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale (Mr. Trippier).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not consider that clause 2(3) conflicts with clause 2(2) in respect of an offence carrying a maximum penalty of less than 21 days' imprisonment. Subsection (2) provides simply that the maximum term of detention in respect of an offence may not exceed the maximum term of imprisonment for that offence. The only exception in subsection (3) is that contained in subsection (4). It follows, therefore, that if the maximum term of imprisonment for an offence is less than 21 days, the court has no power to make a detention centre order in respect of it. The policy is that in respect of an offence other than a failure to comply with a requirement of supervision, an offender should never be sentenced to a detention centre order unless the offence merits a period of 21 days or more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that my hon. Friend will accept perhaps when he has the opportunity of seeing it in print—that that meets his point. I am grateful to him for raising it. When I first read the clause, it occurred to me as well. We shall certainly examine the matter again to make sure that it is technically right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that I am entitled—without fear of being charged with undue partisanship, let along pugnacity—to take issue with those hon. Members, notably the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk), who claim that the Opposition have a monopoly in desiring to see a compassionate and humane penal system. That cannot bear close examination, and it diminishes the tone and the value of our important debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely the facts can be accepted by all who look at such matters sensibly. Every Member of Parliament is concerned to ensure that the public are protected from those who are generally recognised to represent a danger to them, particularly if they commit violent offences. At the same time, we should ensure that there is a humane and decent regime in the prisons and other custodial establishments to which a proper penal policy requires that dangerous offenders should be sent. That is the balance. I hope that it can be accepted that there is common ground on that, so that we need not return to the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to discuss prison conditions—and it is right that we should do so—let us not forget that by cutting the prison building programme, the previous Government put back the provision of thousands of new places. It may be said that detention centres are incompatible with a humane penal policy, but let it not be forgotten that the 1969 Act gave Governments power to abolish detention centres for the 14 to 17-year-old age band. The previous
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>176</span>
Government did not make use of that power between 1974 and 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All sides share the objectives, but we shall not advance the cause of achieving a sensible and practical balance by importing a monopoly of compassion to one side, or suggesting that the other side is motivated by a kind of blood lust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that there are those in the 14 to 21 age bands who have to be sent away on some form of custodial sentence. They form a minority among offenders, but we all know that they exist. The question is whether they all go to the same kind of custodial regime or whether a distinction should be made. In the Green Paper produced practically with the last gasp of the pervious Government in December 1978, a generic sentence was put forward as a provisional and tenative possibility —an opinion. But the advice that is available to us is that it is not possible to provide a regime that is suitable for the short sentence—as little as three weeks, as much as four months—in youth custody centres. Those are centres, which look after people from four months upwards—four months to 12 months in the case of the 15 to 17-years-olds, and above that age band, from 17 to 21, for a maximum period determined by the maximum imprisonment sentence that a court can pass on an adult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The advice available to the Government is that it is not practical to use a youth custody centre which is geared to looking after the medium-term custodial sentence for a regime suitable for a three-week inmate. Youth custody centres, as clause 9 makes clear, are places where offenders
	<br><q><p>" may be detained and given training, instruction and work and prepared for their release ".</p></q>
Legislation has never contained any more detailed description of a regime. A description of types of regime is given in publications such as " Sentence of the Court", which all courts are aware of and have access to. When the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) says that courts are not given any guidance about what goes on in detention centres, he is not displaying his normal realism, because all courts know the nature of a detention centre. Indeed, I have just looked up the paragraph in the " Sentence of the Court" publication, which describes the type of regime that applies there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the practical choice for those who have the responsibility for these matters as distinct from those who, no doubt contrary to their wishes, are able only to comment upon them, is how to cope in a penal system with those whom the courts ought to send away for only a short time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the basis of the detention centre. It is a separate order, because it caters for a separate duration of sentence, for which a separate regime is required. In my last brief contribution I described what that was. The intention is that there should be a basic two-week programme based on work, basic education, physical education, parades and inspections. That one can provide in a detention centre, but one cannot, on the advice available to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0232">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>177</span>
us, provide it satisfactorily in a youth custody centre which deals with the longer-term prisoner, who can therefore benefit from a wider form of training and education. That is why the detention centres are preserved in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to what goes on there, the right hon. and learned Gentleman questioned whether I or anybody else had faith. It is not a question of faith. It is a question of reasoning, hope and experimentation. I make no apology for the fact that we are experimenting now in four detention centres with a more vigorous regime. If it were a question of faith, we should have applied it right across the board, but we are experimenting in the full knowledge that the reconviction rate after two years from the detention centres is depressingly high. It is misleading to draw from the fact the conclusion that the detention centres are necessarily failures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one compares those sentenced to a detention centre with those who are made the subject of probation or supervision orders, one is not necessarily comparing like with like, and probably one is not comparing like with like, for the obvious reason that those whom the courts put on supervision or probation orders are likely to have demonstrated at that stage less propensity to criminality than those whom the courts send to a detention centre. Therefore, none of us can be certain, but those of us with responsibility for these affairs have to provide somewhere where the small minority of dangerous young offenders can be kept in custody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said at our first sitting that our constituents would regard us as crazy if we were to abandon the detention centre regime and adopt the amendment—one of the first amendments moved in Committee—to provide no custodial order for young offenders up to 17 years of age, apart from the order for life custody when someone has committed murder. Yet that amendment was put forward with great fervour as being an opening shot. There was a fall-back position that the age thresholds should be raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that the form of custodial sentence for young boys who commit violent crime must be a detention centre? Is he saying that no other form of custodial treatment is available and furthermore should not be available? I realise that at present nothing else is available, but does not the Bill give us the opportunity to find an alternative to the detention centre? To keep the detention centre simply on the grounds that that is all there is at the moment is no argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I am not saying that that should be the only form of custodial treatment or custodial order. If that were so, we should not be providing for youth custody for those whom the courts think should go into custody for more than four months. Of course what the hon. Lady inferred is not right. We believe that there should be a custodial order which enables the court to sentence people to custody for as little as three weeks—in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>178</span>
other words, a short term, which should be served in a separate establishment for the proper occupation and training of people serving such a term. That is not capable of being merged satisfactorily with the youth custody centre, which looks after medium-term offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not weary the Committee by repeating that argument, but it is central to the clause stand part debate. 1 take the point made by the hon. Member for Ormskirk that now that courts can send people to detention centres for three weeks, there is a risk that they will send more people there. It is a risk, but 1 do not regard it as a probability, which is what matters, because the Magistrates' Association in particular has made it clear that in its view that would be a grave abuse of the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Crown court judges will take the same view, and I am sure that opportunities will be given for guidance in that respect—that a detention sentence order must be made only when it is right in the first instance to send somebody into custody. So I do not think that the practice will be abused and lead to more people being sent to detention centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have acknowledged that it is central to this part of the Bill to have the two tiers of detention centre and youth custody. I accept what the hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons) said in part, although I do not adopt all his argument. But I am grateful for any support for the two-tier system. If we were to go down the road urged upon us by the Opposition, young offenders would certainly spend longer in custody, and none of us want that. Therefore, I beg move that the clause stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
