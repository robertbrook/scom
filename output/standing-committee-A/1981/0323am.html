	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Warren Hawksley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(The Wrekin)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This new clause, which I believe is one of the most important that we shall debate, has the support of 23 hon. Members covering the whole spectrum of the Conservative Party. I said on Second Reading that I believed the Bill did not go far enough, that it was not a strong enough deterrent and that it did not give enough encouragement to young offenders to reform. In particular, I believe that it does not give enough
	<span class='label label-info column'>702</span>
protection to the victims of crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move the new clause as a deterrent to offenders and as a protection for the victims of those offenders. I suggest that we have for too long in debates on new clauses and amendments, discussed the rights of the criminal. Let us today try to remember the victims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the new clause was put down, I believe that the urgency for it has increased, following the publication of the latest statistics showing that violent crime has increased even more than we realised when we began our discussions. We have seen statistics which show that robberies and violence in London have risen during the past year by about 34 per cent., and public concern about violence has been expressed more strongly during the past few weeks than at any other time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are right to praise the police and the Home Secretary for the increase in the number of policemen on the beat, and they are right to improve the pay and conditions of police officers, but I believe that the outcry which we are all receiving in letters, when we talk to people, or when we have our advice clinics, shows how concerned the public are about the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the national figures for crimes of violence against the person. I have chosen three years in particular, starting in 1948, which was the year that corporal punishment was abolished. In that year crimes of violence against the person totalled 5,183. The next year I have taken is 1968, the year that the Barry report on corporal punishment was published. We find that the total in that year had increased to 15,759. If we look at 1981, we find that the figure has gone up to 100,200—a 20-fold increase from the time when corporal punishment was abolished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Corporal punishment was abolished for children under 17. The figures that the hon. Gentleman is using include the adult figures for violence. Is he suggesting that there is some quaint correlation between the punishment for children under 17 and subsequent offences of violence by adults?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to prove to the Committee that if corporal punishment has a deterrent effect, and if we accept that the figures I have given are frightening, we should consider seriously the introduction of corporal punishment to deal with the statistics I have given. That they refer to crimes of violence, not subdivided on an age basis, but a 20-fold increase in crimes of violence against the person since corporal punishment was abolished is to my mind a statistic that cannot be ignored. That puts us into a completely different ball game, and we really must consider what deterrent we can use against crime of this sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be concerned particularly about crimes of "mugging". Everybody has seen cases in their local papers of elderly people who have been mugged for just a few pounds. Only last Wednesday there was a report on the front page of the London 	<i>Evening Standard</i> about a lady who
	<br><blockquote><p>"was battered and left for dead by a coloured man wielding a four-pound hammer. His haul from her council flat in Albert Square, Clapham, was a pension book and a few pounds from the gas meter."</p></blockquote>
He was prepared to leave her for dead for a few pounds. That is the sort of case which is causing the greatest concern at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0527">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>703</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Parris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope my hon. Friend is not suggesting that corporal punishment would be nearly sufficiently severe a punishment for a crime like that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I accept that my hon. Friend is right. I will be suggesting that it is an additional penalty which magistrates may feel would have a deterrent effect and which they may wish to use in addition to other punishments that are currently available. In my new clause there is no suggestion that it should be a penalty on its own; it is purely and simply one which backs up the powers that the courts have already.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon' Gentleman's new clause says: "on summary conviction". In those circumstances an offence of that nature would be dealt with by a higher court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point being that the penalty would be in addition to. or as well as, whatever that court felt was appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Accrington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must have framed his own new clause and must understand that it deals with punishment meted out by the magistrates court—summary conviction, those are the words—and not the Crown Court. Is it really suggested that someone who has committed a crime as serious as this person committed—the one to which the 	<i>Evening Standard</i> refers—would appear before the magistrates' court? He clearly would not. I should hope he would not. It would be quite monstrous if he did. He would be sentenced to—	<i>[Interruption.]</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot have interventions on interventions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does the hon. Gentleman suggest, even if it were feasible, that this form of punishment—birching—could be administered because it cannot be administered by a superior court? Therefore he is talking nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point I am trying to make is that it has a deterrent effect. Whether this case was dealt with by a court that could administer it, or whether it was decided that a very long term of imprisonment was the just penalty for a crime such as this, I believe the deterrent effect would reduce particularly these crimes of violence which we are seeing in our cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had the case of the Sunday school teacher who did not dare go out in daylight because she had been mugged four times within a year. Every hon. Member has heard stories of people who are frightened to go out in daylight, let alone at night. It is to those people that we owe a duty to bring in something which will be a deterrent, the sort which the country wants. Since I put down this new clause, I have received much correspondence, up to 30 letters in one post on one occasion, and yet I have had only three letters opposing the principle of bringing back corporal punishment. It is important to realise that the people need and want this new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like now to turn to the wording of the new clause. I was asked earlier where the wording had come
	<span class='label label-info column'>704</span>
from. In fact, it is not my own drafting. I admit that entirely. I have borrowed it from other legislation applicable in the Isle of Man. I am no lawyer, but I believe that we should have a debate today on the principle rather than on the detail. However, it is based on the Isle of Man Petty Sessions and Summary Jurisdiction Act 1927, the Summary Jurisdiction Act 1960 and the directive of the island's Lieutenant Governor. Those three pieces together cover all the relevance in the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At an early stage in our discussions, the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) had a go at those who were supporting this new clause and suggested that we were particularly appreciative of the detail which it gave. The reason for the inclusion of all the detail, is that if we had not put it in he would have been the first to jump and ask who was going to do the birching, how was it going to be done and with what? It is for those reasons that I have borrowed the Isle of Man's details to make it quite clear that it is practical to carry out the sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we look at the three categories that are mentioned in the new clause, subsection (a) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"unlawfully assault or beat any other person".</p></blockquote>
This is particularly aimed at cases of violence such as muggings and street offences. It would give an added deterrent in that area and it is the most important of the three categories. Were the Government to accept just this category, I would be only too happy to see it introduced in preference to the other two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other two, subsections (b) and (c) have, I suggest, a use and would be a deterrent in certain cases. Category (b) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"make use of provoking language or behaviour tending to a breach of the peace".</p></blockquote>
There were cases during the riots last summer and during football hooligan incidents when the deterrent effect of birching could have been useful. Some people may consider subsection (c) too wide, as it uses the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"commit an act of criminal damage".</p></blockquote>
I have put it in is because I think the judiciary might decide that in cases where life had been put at risk by acts of criminal damage—one thinks particularly of damaging a phone box which may be used in cases of emergency or a life belt beside the river which is used for saving life—there could be a case for suggesting that if such acts were a regular occurrence a deterrent was necessary to make sure that they did not happen again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the first is the most important of the three categories of people who could be birched under this new clause. I believe also that it is right that it should be left to the judiciary to decide whether or not it should be used. The new clause makes it quite clear that it
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall be liable on summary conviction in addition to, or instead of, current penalties".</p></blockquote>
I hope that answers the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris). It is important that it should not necessarily be considered as the only punishment available for these crimes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the question of whether it is a deterrent or not. Many of the opponents of the re-introduction of corporal punishment believe that it is not a deterrent. I disagree. I believe that it is a deterrent and that it offers protection to the victims of crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0528">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>705</span>
I go back to the 1930s when there was an epidemic of bag snatching in London. Lord Justice Avory let it be known then that anyone convicted in his court of bag snatching would receive the "cat". That proved to be a deterrent—the fact that they were liable to be hurt. The offence, which had reached epidemic proportions, stopped overnight. It is important that we remember that case before we vote on the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to turn now to the Isle of Man. The Isle of Man will feature fairly large in this debate because there it is still the law that corporal punishment can be inflicted even after the European Court decision. Whether it has a deterrent effect or not can be summarised in one set of statistics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we look at crimes of assault for the last two years before the European Court's judgment in April 1978— that is, the years 1977 and 1978—we find there were two cases of assault on the island. However, in the two years after that—in 1979 and 1980—the two cases had risen to 10 and 12 cases. It is important that we realise that that happened immediately after the European Court's judgment and the feeling on the island that corporal punishment would not be used again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to people on the island who helped me when I went on a fact-finding visit there, particularly the police, the prison office and the Attorney-General of the Island, Mr Kaye, who gave me much helpful advice. Although I gather certain people are suggesting that he believes that corporal punishment is not a deterrent, I question this, because in a speech that he delivered last year he says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As regards the merits of judicial corporal punishment, I will only say that it is impossible to prove from statistics that it is effective as a deterrent. But one must accept that that consideration applies equally to other kinds of punishment. It is in fact extremely difficult to determine what effect, if any, particular forms of punishment have on the community as a whole or on particular individuals".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Cadogan committee in 1938 analysed 400 cases very closely, and the evidence is absolutely clear that the incidence of corporal punishment made no difference to the recidivist rate. That was brought up to date by the Advisory Council on the Penal System report in 1960, which came to the same conclusijn, after very close study. A recent report analysed the Isle of Man statistics over a very long period and came to the same conclusion. The hon. Gentleman has been rather selective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would use the same charge against the hon. Gentleman's intervention. He also is being somewhat selective in the figures that he is choosing. I appreciate that we can bandy figures across the Committee and argue about them all day, but I believe that I shall be able to prove that there is a deterrent effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take up the point that the hon. Member for York (Mr. Alexander W. Lyon) made. How is it that a report made in 1960 on the effects of corporal punishment could come to any conclusion when corporal punishment had been withdrawn some 12 years previously? Where were their findings in that 12 years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. I wish to consider the accuracy of a previous statement
	<span class='label label-info column'>706</span>
made in this Committee, when the hon. Member for Ormskirk said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Let us look at the experience of birching in the Isle of Man. We will find that the figure is not much different from the 76 per cent."</p></blockquote>
He is talking here of the recidivist rate that had been mentioned during that stage. He continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In fact, 75 per cent, of those who have been birched commit further offences within two years."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 18 February I982;c. 167.]</p></blockquote>
I am not sure where he got that statistic from. When I was on the island I obtained the best figures I possibly could, and have gone through the details of 76 cases of birching that took place between 1960 and 1981. Of those, there were only 29 cases of reconviction to date— not just in the two-year period to which he was referring —in the period from the committing of the offence, or the appearance in court, until today. Of these, eight re-offended on the mainland or in Ireland, and were not subject to the deterrent effect of corporal punishment being reintroduced or reused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have, then, 55 out of the 76 who appeared and were birched on the island not reappearing in court on the island. By my arithmetic, that is a recidivist rate of 28 per cent. We should compare that, I suggest, with the 76 per cent, which has been thrown around as the figure for detention centres.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend tell the Committee how many of those 55 were visitors to the island?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have the exact figure to hand, but something like 40 per cent, were, in fact, visitors to the island. The records produced by the police and the prisons over there have followed up the cases, and the statistics which I gave included in the cases that I mentioned the eight who had been convicted on the mainland or in Ireland. They followed through the question of whether they had reconvicted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the issue went to the European Court, a petition was raised on the island by people who, unlike some professional agitators on this side of the water, have no experience of raising petitions. Yet in three weeks they succeeded in obtaining, out of the 45,000 registered voters on the island, 31,000 signatures asking that they should be allowed to retain corporal punishment. A very large percentage of the public on the Isle of Man believes that it is a deterrent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Examples were quoted of young people from Scotland and from the North-West arriving by boat at Douglas, who went to the first policeman they saw and asked "Do you still retain birching on the island?". When he said "Yes", they replied "Don't worry". Policemen have assured me that when they said "Yes, we do keep it," the youngsters have replied "Don't worry, we will not cause any trouble while we are on the island."— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members may believe that funny. I think that it is a rather serious matter, and if we can prove that it has a deterrent effect—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Clark 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Sutton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) has one particular characteristic—of course, we treasure him for all his characteristics—in that he always laughs when
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0529">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>707</span>
something is being said which he regards as defeating his own case, or is significant in argument against him. This is something that we have become used to in the Committee, but I have noticed it on the Floor of the House and in other places as well. So, my hon. Friend should take comfort when the hon. Member for Ormskirk laughs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that word of comfort. We also have from people living on the island, and from the police on the island as well, comments that when a situation develops in a pub during the summer when there are a lot of holiday makers about and it looks as if it is heading towards a nasty incident, the mention of birching seems to defuse the situation very quickly indeed. In fact, it appears to many people on the island that it is a deterrent and it is important that we should treat it in that way.

I suggest that its deterrent effect will be a desirable benefit to the arguments that have gone on in this Committee that we should try to keep young offenders out of custodial sentences. Both sides of the Committee have argued for many days that we should try to make sure that we do not send youngsters to detention centres unless it is absolutely necessary. I believe that the deterrent effect and the possibility of using this as a short, sharp shock would give the opportunity to keep some more people out of custodial categories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us now look at the arguments that are put up against the new clause. Two arguments have been put in the press and to the Committee. There is, first,the case of the European Court's decision and, secondly, there is the argument about the letter we received from the BM A. I want to deal with both those points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that lately we have had some interesting judgments from the European Court of Human Rights, and I suggest that many of them go against the interests of this country. They cause me very great concern. One is, obviously, the Tyrer case which involves corporal punishment on the Isle of Man. The other is the case of Campbell and Casons which is the Scottish case of caning in schools, although if hon. Members wish blindly to rest their case on the use of the European Court's judgment, possibly they would prefer to look at British Rail employees and the closed shop because that would probably be equally as useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us look particularly at the Tyrer case. He tried to withdraw his case when it got to the European Court. It is interesting also that since that judgment was given, somebody else was sentenced to corporal punishment on the Isle of Man and also tried to withdraw his appeal. Unfortunately, the judiciary and the Establishment would not allow, the person, in either case to withdraw their appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case at the European Court need not have gone ahead because they tried to withdraw the appeal. Both young offenders, I suggest, were prepared to accept their punishment. In the Isle of Man case, last year the youngster went to the police station and confirmed that he was prepared to take the strokes of the birch. That is important. I suggest that the appeals imply that it was the liberal do-gooders who were using the young criminals to push a case for their own purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Tyrer case we will find that the issue hinges on article 3 of the Convention, which states:
	<span class='label label-info column'>708</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"No one shall be subject to torture, or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."</p></blockquote>
Let us not forget that the European Court cleared us on whether it was torture, inhumane treatment or punishment, but found us guilty of the word "degrading". I personally do not accept that corporal punishment is degrading. I believe that we could win this argument if we had to fight it again. In both the Tyrer case and the Scottish caning case, it was interesting that the British judge hearing the case gave a dissenting judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The judgment of Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice ran to nine pages. It is not my intention to burden the Committee with that nine-page judgment today. I think that it will suffice to read the opening sentences of his dissenting judgment, when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To my regret, I feel obliged to dissent from the view taken by the Court on what is the main issue in this case—namely whether the punishment inflicted on Mr. Tyrer—he being then a schoolboy —amounted to a "degrading" punishment contrary to Article 3 of the European Human Rights Convention".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dulwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even though the hon. Gentleman may disagree with them in a number of cases, and even though the British judge may have taken a different view, the judgments are clear and are binding upon us. If the hon. Gentleman is arguing that we should act in plain defiance of the proposed judgments and of our obligations under the European Convention of Human Rights, he is arguing that we should be in breach of it and cease to be one of the civilised countries in Europe which not only started the European Convention, not only were we a founder member, but ever since under successive Governments have encouraged it and acted in accordance with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly have no objection to our withdrawing if that were thought by the Government to be necessary. I suggest that the circumstances today are different from when that judgment was given. I maintain that we have justice on our side so far as the decision is concerned, because that case involved the Isle of Man, a small area where it may have had a deterrent effect. Certainly the level of crime was very different from what we are dealing with now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must question whether, at some future date, we shall find that somebody will take a case to the European Court of Human Rights and argue that prison could possibly be degrading. We might find that there is no end to the judgments that could be made against us. I question, too, the position of the European Court, because although it was suggested that we were bound by its decisions, I believe that our laws take precedence over those laws.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote from a case in which Lord Scarman gave a judgment in the other place in 1980, when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This House's decision, even though the European Court has held the rule it declares to be an infringement of the Convention, is the law. Our Court's must continue to look,not to the European Court's decision but to the House of Lord's decision".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, although we may make out a case that we ought, in all honesty, to withdraw from the Convention, we here have the power and the rights to make a decision which may appear to be contrary to a decision of that European Court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought thatthat wasan argument that could well be made.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would ask the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendall) not to be led aside from this important issue by the irrelevant remarks made by his hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman must face up to the issue. It is, of course, perfectly true that in this country the law as laid down by Parliament takes priority, but the law as laid down by Parliament may be in breach of our international obligations, including this one under the European Convention on Human Rights. Is the hon. Gentleman prepared to cease to be a party to that Convention, because that would be the effect of this legislation if it is passed by Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought I gave a clear answer that my own personal view was, "Yes". I cannot be much clearer than to use the words, "Yes, I would be prepared to see us withdraw". I do not believe it would be necessary, although it is interesting that when we look at the more recent case of the cane in Scotland, the Government have not yet responded in any great degree concerning what should happen. In fact, the comments of one junior Minister have led to further complaints to the European Court because of implications that perhaps the Government were not taking that judgment as seriously as they are taking the judgment in the Tyrer case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be ruled out of order if I started a debate as to whether we should leave the Convention and give up our membership of the European Court. However, I believe that it is right that we should put our own interests first. If we possibly can, we should remember that the European Court has been set up to be a defender of the public interest and it is important that we should remember that because I would ask, whether the public interest is not the right to go about one's business without fear and worry of being mugged or attacked. I suggest that public interest must be the interest of the victim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the letter that, I think, all hon. Members have received from the BMA. I found this letter interesting. I note that the BMA admits that most other countries are ignoring the declaration of Tokyo. I do not use that as an argument to suggest that we should also follow that line, but I ask the Committee to read the small print—the objections that they have—because they re the same as those of the European Court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Court has ruled that it is not torture, inhuman or cruel. It has said that it is "degrading" and that is one of the four or five categories that the BMA mentions. I have tried to prove that the argument that we are having today is whether it is or is not degrading. If it is not degrading, the arguments of the BMA that it is contravening the declaration of Tokyo would not be right. I accept that the BMA is perhaps a rather
	<span class='label label-info column'>710</span>
exclusive closed shop, but I would point out that it has tried to implement this policy for the Isle of Man. I have received letters from quite a few doctors—I had one only this morning—who said that if this law were passed they would be only too willing to officiate and to act in what they believe was the young criminal's interest by being present at the birching.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be grateful and amused, as I was, to note the BMA being opposed to anything for which a fee is payable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not wish to go down that road. I do not think that it was the fee that led to these people coming to me and saying that if this became law they would be prepared to officiate, because I believe that they took a very different view, as did that dissenting judge in the European Court case. They do not consider that this sentence is degrading and they believe that under the declaration of Tokyo they are quite free to officiate and they would be only too happy to argue with the BMA if it tried to take any action against them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the current crime wave calls for tough action. 1 believe that the figures which I have given on crimes of violence against the person justify this new clause. I believe that if we were taken to the European Court we could win.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Accrington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Gentleman is about to conclude. He talks about ignoring the findings of the European Court. If that is the case why has he put in subsection (9):
	<br><blockquote><p>"The whipping shall be inflicted on the posterior over thechild's ordinary cloth trousers."</p></blockquote>
Is that not to take into account the findings of the European court, which said that the indignity of having the punishment administered over the bare posterior aggravated to some extent the degrading character of the applicant's punishment, but it was not the only or determining factor?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Isle of Man has presumably taken that into account by changing its own regulations. Is that why he has now decided to include that provision rather than the original type of punishment which was over the bare posterior? He seems to be taking account at least of something the old clause says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought for a moment that the hon. and learned Gentleman was going to support my argument and accept that perhaps it was not contravention of the European Court's judgment if we put this in. I welcome what he said, because I was argunig that we can win a case if anyone complains about the enforcement of the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case concerning the Isle of Man was not fought as strongly as it should have been. The dissenting judgment that we heard was the correct one. If the Government cannot accept this new clause today, I ask that serious consideration be given to an updating of the 1960 inquiry. We are in a different situation today. I have told the Committee that the number of cases of crimes of violence has increased eight-fold since the 1960 review. I ask that the Government, if they cannot at this stage accept this new clause, seriously consider whether an inquiry should be set up to look at the changed circumstances since 1960.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0531">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>711</span>
In asking for an inquiry, I do not ask that it should delay a decision, but only that it should take place and come to a recommendation very quickly, particularly as to what effect corporal punishment would have on the terrific increase we have had lately in the cases of violence against the person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr right hon. Friend the Home Secretary was recently reported as asking those who advocated tough measures to give details of what they would do. I hope that the new clause gives the details that he was asking for on that occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Dubs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has consistently talked about violence against the person, yet subsection (1)(£) of the new clause talks of:
	<br><blockquote><p>"make use of provoking language or behaviour tending to a breach of the peace:"</p></blockquote>
He has not at any point sought to justify why the particular provision should attract corporal punishment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman did not hear what I said or misunderstood. I went through the three categories at the beginning of my speech and explained exactly the reasoning for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stated then that the first category was the most important, but I suggested that category 	<i>(b).</i> to which he takes exception, might be available in the event of similar riots as we experienced last summer or to deal with particular outbursts of football hooliganism. In those cases category (b) would be of some use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Jo Richardson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman care to define what he means by "provoking language"? The hon. Gentleman laughed, but I mean it seriously. It is so wide open. What are we supposed to understand by it? Is it using a word which is not generally acceptable? Is that "provoking language?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady is worried, she should remember that the judiciary will decide the interpretation. It is a wording that has been used in the Isle of Man with no problem. When I say the judiciary will decide the interpretation, it will give them, in cases where obvious provocative language has been used or behaviour tending towards a breach of the peace has taken place, an opportunity to consider the possibility of using corporal punishment in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This might be desirable where there is an outbreak of football hooliganism or riots, and it is known that the court will take a possible birching line. The deterrent effect would be considerable. Certainly, in the case of football hooligans and the riots, someone could have been charged with using provoking language or "behaviour tending to a breach of the peace;".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a genuine inquiry. I did not understand until this moment that the hon. Gentleman was trying to change the substantive law. I do not know where in English law it is an offence to use provoking language. There are offences of using certain kinds of language in certain circumstances, but I assume that the hon. Gentleman is simply trying to translate the Isle of Man position into English law. Is
	<span class='label label-info column'>712</span>
he really trying to create a new offence, or is he talking about one or other of a number of cases in which a particular kind of language is an offence in English law?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to the second part, is he saying that conduct likely to cause a breach of the peace, where the punishment at the moment is a binding over and which has been treated in this way since, I think, 1351, should now be considered such an aggravated offence that the offender should be whipped and flogged?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman should realise that subsection 	<i>(b)</i> offers an alternative. It does not have to be used. The binding over that may happen at the moment could be retained if that was the wish of the court. However, the courts might feel that it was desirable—for example, in cases of the outbreak of regular football hooliganism or riots—to make sure that the deterrent effect of corporal punishment was implemented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me ask the hon. Gentleman another question. He mentioned football hooliganism and provoking riots three or four times during his speech, but I find it difficult to relate those activities to provoking language. Football hooliganism is a much more serious matter than the type of language which may be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that other offences may be committed by football hooligans or by rioters which might well be much more serious, right up to the crime of murder. Both football hooligans and rioters have, in fact, committed murders in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bendall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend not agree that one of the worst types of provoking language is that which is often used between white and coloured people to provoke incidents, and this proposal is a most important part of the new clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for those remarks and I can see that where, for example, skinheads go around provoking young coloureds, there could well be a case for having a deterrent. I am surprised that Labour Members should laugh at the idea of implementing a deterrent for young skinheads who provoke young coloureds. I think it is most desirable that they should be covered by this legislation. I believe that the Home Office team should accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Kilroy-Silk 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ormskirk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman would comment on the inequities that might result. Let us imagine a situation where two friends have gone to a football match together—Chelsea supporters, naturally. One is 18 and one is 19, and they both commit the same offence. Why is it fair and appropriate that the 18-year-old should be susceptible to being flogged but not the 19-year-old?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not too sure whether the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that we should raise the age limit for birching. If the new clause is accepted he could perhaps raise the matter on Report so that it does not cover just young offenders but older ones as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0532">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>713</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, but he is missing the point. He still has to answer the question. Why does he consider corporal punishment more appropriate in the case that I have cited, for the 18-year-old rather than the 19-year-old? If he really is —as he pretends to be—concerned about the more violent crimes, why has reserved this particular option for the 10 to 18-year-olds, who are not on the evidence predominantly those who embark on violent crime? If he really is concerned about this would it not be better for him to have extended this measure right across the board?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is well aware that we have penalties for young offenders different from those for adults. This is quite common under other sections of the law and it is not unusual for us to have this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bendall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend not agree that the learned Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) argued quite strongly in other parts of this Bill about age? I find it difficult to understand the point he is trying to make now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the point that I am trying to make. We do not have penalties for young offenders different from those for older people. If the hon. Gentleman really believes that it would be desirable, in the case of corporal punishment, to include those who are older, and if he supports us today, he could try to raise the age limit on Report. I sincerely hope that he does so, because I believe that the vote on this new clause is very important. It is important that we realise that we are representing not just our own views but those of many constitutents who are concerned at this time about the sort of offences that would be covered. It is desirable that there should be a sentence available to the court which can be used sparingly but which will act as a deterrent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, particularly for the last word he used, "deterrent", because that is the point that I wanted to put to him. Is he saying that these types of punishment are likely to be deterrents for the particular offences in the new clause but not for any other types of offence? For example, what about the highly dangerous o.fence of taking and driving away a motor car when the person concerned is not capable of driving it without being a danger to the public, or driving while under the influence of drink or drugs? There is a whole host of offences which can be a very serious danger to the public. Is he suggesting that corporal punishment would not be a deterrent to people who might be tempted to commit that kind of offence but is uniquely a deterrent for people who commit the offences in subsection (1)?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, seeing that under his new clause liability exists up to the age of 18, is he arguing that after 18 this type of penalty would cease to be a deterrent or is his argument that it would be an inhuman or cruel punishment for those older than 18 and therefore perhaps more able to sustain the pain which is caused by it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>714</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I really feel that we arc being led up the garden path by the right hon. and learned Gentleman. To suggest, as the hon. Member for Ormskirk did, that the age was vital and that it would not be a deterrent above a certain age, leads mc to repeat my suggestion that he should support the new clause today and that on Report he should try to raise the age if that is his genuine belief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must justify the letter of his new clause. I am sure he accepts that, and the logic of it. Can he explain to me what research he has done into the actual instrument to be used? He has gone into great detail about the weight, the length of the handle, the circumference of the spray, the circumefrence of handle at top of the binding and the circumference of handle six inches from end. What is particularly magical about the figures in the new clause? Why has he come to those particular measurements? Has he done any research into it? If it is an inch longer or an inch shorter what damage will be done? The Committee is entitled to know why he has come to those conclusions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I really wish that I had not given way on that occasion. It is hardly necessary to respond to that particular point. The measurements which 1 put into the new clause are those which are accepted and used in the Isle of Man where they actually have birches and canes. I am not arguing that the measurements should be an inch longer or an inch shorter. If the right hon. and learned Gentleman supports the new clause, he can take up the issue and make the options wider, if he wishes, on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would capital punishment be suitable for other offences and would it be a deterrent in those cases? I am sure that we could use as an example that capital punishment would be a deterrent for the person who stole a car and was drunk, but I am sure that the right hon. and learned Gentleman would not advocate that capital punishment should be brought back. Certain degrees and levels suitable for particular punishments. Of the three categories that I have set out in the clause, the first—
	<br><blockquote><p>"unlawfully assault or beat any other person",</p></blockquote>
is the most important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Committee supports the clause, we shall be making Britain a much safer place. The public will be much happier if they can go about their business in daylight and at night without the fears and worries that the recent increase in crime has given them. It is a pleasure to beg to ask leave, Mr. Watkins, that the new clause be read a Second time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Shirley Summerskill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to oppose the new clause moved by the hon.

We thought that it had discarded many years ago the image of the "Hang them and flog them" party, which it presented every year at its annual conference, and at the annual women's conference. Now they seem to be going back in time. I hope that the Minister will not respond to the punitive lusts which are demonstrated in the new clause. My right hon. and my hon. Friends completely reject the provisions set out in the new
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0533">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>715</span>
clause as methods of dealing with the serious rise in crimes of violence. If this is what the Tory Party has to propose, it shows a dearth of thinking on its part on how to deal with an extremely serious situation. It is a completely retrograde step for the State to give violence an official seal of approval, which is what the clause would do. It is not the answer to brutalise the sectors of society that condone this method of punishment and to brutalise those who are made to enforce it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause reads like something out of a horror film or horror comic. There is no logic in the way it is drawn up. If birching is all right for the 14 to 18-year-olds, why is it not all right for adults? We oppose birching and caning for every human being of whatever age but the new clause picks out the 14 to 18-year-olds for the imposition of this particularly bestial and brutalising form of treatment. The clause is totally unacceptable and totally illogical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is illogical in her own argument. When I argued earlier that we should lower the age for detention centres from 14 to 12 years, 1 did not hear a sound from the Opposition Benches to suggest that there was anything illogical about the age of 14 as a starting-point for detention centres. If that is logical, and we have to take a logical step somewhere in order to define the area of any punishment, the new clause is equally logical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. A. Trippier 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rossendale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon.

Is she saying that the whole of the Labour Party is against caning in schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are against all detention centres at any age for anybody. That is the case we have made throughout the proceedings in Committee. Similarly, we are against the form of punishment set out in the new clause for either sex. 1 know that the proposal is for the male sex and not the female sex, another illogicality. We are against it for both sexes and for all ages. As for the question of whom 1 speak for, I know that I am speaking for my right hon. Friend and hon. Friends who are members of the Committee. I can say fairly certainly that 1 speak for the vast majority of the Parliamentary Labour Party. Perhaps I may go even further and say that I probably speak for the majority of ordinary constituency members of the Labour Party.

Mention has been made of the situation in the rest of Europe. In most countries of Western Europe, with the possible exception of Germany under the Nazis, there seems to be no record of judicial corporal punishment ever having existed. It would be a retrograde step to reintroduce it here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, corporal punishment has proved ineffective in the fight against crime. No doubt we could all read out pages of statistics, evidence and reports dealing with the subject. According to the NACRO figures—I would say that they are always reliable; I have never found them to be unreliable—when corporal punishment was available in cases of robbery with violence, before its abolition in 1948, three separate Government surveys found that offenders who underwent corporal
	<span class='label label-info column'>716</span>
punishment committed more subsequent crimes than similar offenders who received other sentences. More recently, over 75 per cent, of those birched on the Isle of Man since 1960, have re-offended. It is true—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Hon. Lady where that statistic came from, because I have the history of each case with the list of offences committed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave my source as NACRO, and no doubt the hon. Gentleman will argue the matter out with NACRO after the debate if he wishes to refute it. When we quote figures which have been the result of work and study by statistcians, we clearly have to accept them at their face value. The NACRO figures have not been refuted or denied by Ministers during the debate. If the Minister were able to refute them by quoting Home Office figures, or other evidence, I should not quote NACRO.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady must realise that the NACFO conclusions of 1948 were 34 years ago. I read that in the paper this morning, as I am sure the hon. Lady and many others did. What is the relevance of judgments and inquiries that were made and undertaken that long ago when the world, and certainly this country, has changed considerably?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This was the evidence of three separate Government surveys and not that of NACRO.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady says that back in 1948 more subsequent offenses were committed by offenders who underwent corporal punishment than by those who received other sentences. I suggest that the other sentences were likely to be severe sentences of imprisonment. Has the hon. Lady any statistics about that?

Secondly, having rejected both imprisonment and any form of corporal punishment as deterrents, what positive proposal does she put forward in their place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not totally reject prison as a deterrent. We have rejected, detention centres as they are now operated—that is the other short sharp shock that the Government are proposing. I am not responsible for the fact that these punishments are not deterring offenders. All that the Opposition can do is point out that they are not deterring them. We are therefore proposing various forms of non-custodial sentence because the custodial sentence has not been proved to be effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mr. Hawksley), who moved the new clause, stated that it would protect the victim. I do not understand how birching the offender is protecting the victim. oN doubt the hon. Gentleman was trying to show that it would protect potential victims by being a deterrent. However, all the figures which my hon. Friends and I have been quoting show that it is not a deterrent.

this discussion. It was they that gave rise to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The hon. Member for The Wrekin seemed to imply that as they found that birching was not a torture but constituted degrading punishment, we should therefore be discussing whether to inflict a degrading punishment. My hon. Friends and I would regard a degrading punishment as a completely brutalising method of treating an offender.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the hon. Lady to accept that 1 stated clearly that I did not believe that it was degrading and that was what the argument should be about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Birching and caning in the manner described in the new clause, where it would be done in private by a policeman in the presence of a doctor, would be degrading to the bircher, degrading to the birched and degrading to the community that condones it. If the hon. Gentleman's mind is so blinkered that he does not understand that, it is difficult to explain it to him. The Royal College of Psychiatrists has done a study of the effect of birching and caning on young people. The results showed that although such punishment does not alter delinquent behaviour—1 gather that one of the hon. Gentleman's motives is to make delinquents law-abiding citizens—it could damage a maladjusted person, which is even worse. Therefore, it is at best useless and at worst it is harmful as a form of treatment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady inform the Committee of the date of that report and what evidence the Royal College had before it to cause it to come to those conclusions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In either of these cases the actual physical violence used is really the sanctioning by the State of violence which it is at the same time trying to condemn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the strong representations that have been made by the British Medical Association. Although the British Medical Association has been described as an exclusive closed shop, most doctors are members of it. Many others are members of the Medical Practitioners' Union, of which I am one. and I suggest that the views that I am about to describe are held by the Medical Practitioners' Union. As a life-long member of the Medical Practitioners' Union I know how its mind works. It is a part of ASTMS, which is Mr. Clive Jenkins' union. I do not say that I know how his mind works, but I say that doctors generally would be against the provisions in this new clause, which impose certain obligations upon the medical profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The doctor, first, has to decide that the offender is fit to receive the punishment, and then he must be present during the birching. He is given permission to stop it at any time. When a birching has been stopped on medical grounds, he has to write to the Home Secretary to say why. The majority of doctors would find this a completely unethical way in which to behave. The unscrupulous doctor can always be found, in the same way [Hon. Members: "Oh!".]—that one can always find an unscrupulous member of any profession or trade. However, the British Medical Association
	<span class='label label-info column'>718</span>
represents the majority of doctors and it exists to uphold the standards of that profession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady accept that there would be quite a few doctors who would certainly be quite competent to do it, would be qualified to do it and would be willing to do it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman, when he replies, will give us the names and addresses of the doctors who have offered themselves for this task. I am sure the Committee and the public would be very interested to know who they are and whether they will be prepared to do it free or for payment and, if for payment, how much they will charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British Medical Association has strongly opposed the new clause and the obligations that it imposes on ethical grounds. It draws attention to the United Nations standard minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners and observes that corporal punishment is a prohibited punishment under those rules, which state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a doctor would be acting unethically if he certified a prisoner as fit to undergo a 'whipping' or 'birching'"—</p></blockquote>
As the hon. Gentleman has appreciated, the declaration states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The doctor shall not countenance, condone or participate in the practice of torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or"—</p></blockquote>
here is the phrase used by the European Court—
	<br><blockquote><p>"degrading procedures, whatever the offence of which the victim of such procedures is suspected, accused or guilty,"—</p></blockquote>
I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman will be able to find some volunteers to carry out this punishment, but I can assure him that it is totally against the ethics of the medical profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause should be totally rejected by the Committee and by the House on Report if it happens to reach the Floor of House. The State should not sanction violence. It should not condone violence when that is the very crime and the very brutality that it is trying to outlaw, and this would appear to be totally the wrong way to tackle the serious problem which we are now facing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My main reason for supporting the new clause is that I am personally satisfied that corporal punishment would be a deterrent. Were 1 not convinced of that, I could not see myself supporting a case for retaliatory action against the perpetrators of such repugnant violent crimes as those with which we are all too familiar and which society has the right to seek to terminate. However tempting it may be to suggest that corporal punishment is the punishment to fit the crime when one is speaking of violence and vandalism, such a justification is unacceptable in a so-called civilised society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should find it morally impossible to suggest that young offenders found guilty of crimes of violence and vandalism should be subject to another form of violence simply by way of retribution or recrimination, without any attempt to achieve deterrence. Nor do those who support the new clause consider that its inclusion in the Bill will deter everyone from such acts. However, if it deterred only 20 muggings a year, I should consider it worth while bringing back the provision. I am sick and tired of hearing that we must try to discover why young thugs commit these offences. The do-gooders have had
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0535">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>719</span>
their way for far too long. It is time that we listened to the people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to put this matter to a referendum— basically I am against referendums—I have no doubt that the majority would support the re-introduction of birching. When I was a councillor in Rochdale, violence and vandalism were so bad, and deteriorating so rapidly, that I set up an advisory committee on vandalism. On that committee were represented people from the youth and community services, the police, the magistracy and the social services. I chaired those meetings. The committee spent hour after hour trying to discover why young offenders committed such offences. It was to no avail, because everyone had a different point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was condluded, about 12 months after the committee was set up. that there needed to be a greater deterrents to dissuade young people from committing offences. The argued case against corporal punishment states that it is an act of depravity or, in the words of the hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill). "degrading". How, then, do we describe assaults on elderly people? Is that no degrading? Do we not spend far too much time talking about the offender and not nearly enough time talking about the victim? A fundamental flaw in the case against judicial beatings sent to Committee members by STOP appears on page 5 of its letter, in which statistics are used to prove that a higher proportion of those not sentenced to corporal punishment are not re-convicted of any major offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What was not said was that those who committed violent crime but did not suffer corporal punishment must, in the view of the judiciary, have committed less heinous violence than those who were. I think it understandable that those who commit serious crimes are less likely to re-offend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The major reason that leads me to suggest that corporal punishment is a deterrent is my recollection that it was precisely that when I was at school. I attended not a public school but a direct grant school where caning was administered by the headmaster and the deputy headmaster. I had been warned that if I persisted in acts of foolishmess I would be thrashed. I persisted because I believed that I would not be caught. I was caught and I was thrashed. Contrary to what is suggested in the STOP briefing paper, the last thing I wished to do was to demonstrate my bravado to my school friends. Indeed. I did not even dare tell my father, who would have administered a similar form of corporal punishment again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To cap it all, surprise, surprise, there were marks on that part of my anatomy where one would expect to find them for approximately seven days after I had been caned. So the punishment certainly lasted longer than I thought possible. My point is that I did not offend again. The hon. Members might suggest that I enjoyed it. If I had enjoyed it. I would have offended again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suffered neither lasting mental nor physical harm from the experience. I only wish that those who are violated, mugged or beaten up on our streets could say the same. They cannot, and our responsibility is to them, not the mindless thugs who consider it commonplace to beat up people for the sheer hell of it or to deprive them of their personal possessions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>720</span>
I wish only to make a brief contribution, but the use of the words "civilised society" have occurred on many occasions in the debate. How civilised is our society when elderly people in many parts of the country are terrified to leave their home area? Is that the hallmark of a civilised society? It is not, and this is why we are discussing this issue. I urge colleagues of the Committee to support the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Pitt 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I like the hon. Member for Rossendale (Mr. Trippier), suffered a number of beatings at school for my anti-social behaviour. Strangely, it made no difference to me and I went on to become a Member of Parliament, which is a degree of anti-social behaviour. I know of a number o people who would wish to bring back violence. That is their reaction. Reacting violently with violence produces either more violence in the person against whom the violence has been used or it produces a negative effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the latter quarter of this century we should not be talking about methods which were deemed to be a waste of time 30-odd years ago. The hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) has mentioned three Government reports which showed quite clearly—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bendail</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that 30 years ago there were not the muggings, the crimes of violence and the figures that were produced just a few days ago?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that those crimes in London represented 3 per cent, of the total? Does he agree also that the number of crimes of murder overall is the lowest for seven years? Nevertheless three Government reports have shown conclusively that violence is not a deterrent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our colleagues in the European Community have not used violence in their countries for centuries because they do not regard it as a deterrent. The only country in Europe that has used violence in the past 50 years is Hitler's Germany. The United Nations has outlawed the use of violence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about Mussolini? Does he not count either?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member probably has a greater view of history that I have. I shall not mention Mussolini in this Chamber.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ours is the only country in Europe that is discussing the use of violence against the person. It is an incredibly retrograde step. We are not discussing it in theory. We have before us a shopping list of dimensions which would please an engineer no end. As an engineer, I could draw the proposed cane. There is a list of weights, lengths and circumferences. It is horrifying to see such a detailed list. We are told that it comes from the Isle of Man, and we know what has happened to the Isle of Man. The EEC has outlawed its particularly barbarous acts of violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth is that no one has the right to commit an act of violence against anyone else. One will not cure acts of violence by permitting violence to be committed on those who have committed acts of violence.

	<i>[Interruption.]</i>—Hon. Members seem to be very amused that I could produce a daughter of 20. I assure hon. Members that she would make 10 of some of them. However, we brought up my daughter in a totally nonviolent family environment. We did not use sanctions of physical or mental violence on that young person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that in bringing up this paragon of virtue he or his wife never laid a hand on the anatomy of that child and that the child was never slapped or admonished in any physical way during her entire lifetime?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a conscious effort; and it is a conscious effort on the part of a number of families, who decide to bring up their children in a non-violent regime. We brought up our child to learn self-discipline.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that this form of punishment is violent, but does the hon. Gentleman agree that to deprive a man of his liberty, take him away from his family and put him behind bars for years, is also an intrinsically violent form of punishment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member, because I believe that putting a person behind bars for years on end is not much of a deterrent unless the person has to be kept behind bars because of the specific nature of his crime, or because of his nature. 1 was coming to that point after telling the story of my, moral family. We brought up our daughter in a regime of non-violence and self-discipline, and it worked. It works in most families. I do not see why society cannot bring children up in a regime of self-discipline. One does not create discipline by violence as anybody who has served in the Armed Forces knows. One can either discipline a person because he wants to respond, or one cannot, and any amount of detention or violence that one brings upon them will not make any difference. The person will either give up or will be continually recalcitrant and deviating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is that we should not consider uses of violence as a sanction against people because of their acts of violence. I agree with hon. Members about violent attacks on old people and people in general, but let us not forget that in London 41 per cent, of violent attacks are on people aged between 21 and 30. They are as much at risk as old people, but fortunately they are more able to look after themselves. We should seek regimes and systems that train people within society—not do-gooding. We should make such people face their crimes, make them repay their crime by work and by depriving them of their liberty, but by keeping them within society and not putting them away in prison cells for years. We must make them realise the folly of their ways by reacting to society within it, not by judicial beatings which, as the hon. Member for Halifax has said, degrade the beater, the person being beaten, and, more importantly, the society which allows that beating to take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with the intentions of my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Mr. Hawksley) and others who have put their names to the new clause. I do not oppose the use of corporal punishment by parents on their children, where they
	<span class='label label-info column'>722</span>
see fit to use it, nor do I oppose the availability of corporal punishment in schools, provided that that form of punishment has full parental understanding and approval. On the latter point, however, I recognise the difficulties which have arisen with regard to the Scottish case and the European Court, and it remains to be seen to what extent it continues to be lawfully possible in this country in the light of that court's ruling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend appreciate the difficulty that will arise under the law for teachers in loco parentis if we accept the ruling of the European Court which effectively denies to teachers the parental powers which they have hitherto exercised?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has highlighted the difficulty which is facing our right hon. and hon. Friends in the relevant Government departments and I sympathise with them in their legal plight. However, having made clear my view of corporal punishment in general and in the home, I must say that 1 cannot support the new clause. I shall explain my reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I think that it is intended to affect too wide a range of categories of offenders. There could well be a compelling argument for category (l)(a)—that is to say, the unlawful assault or beating of another person, because that is something which all of my constituents, and I would suspect constituents everywhere, find repugnant whenever it occurs. But, categories 	<i>(\)(b)</i> and 	<i>(c)</i> which have already been mentioned by some hon. Gentlemen, would draw the clause too widely and would be liable to some loose and unsatifsactory interpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, I draw the Committee's attention to one aspect of subsection (l)(c). According to the latest crime statistics, 387,000 people commited offences of criminal damage known to the police and of that about one-quarter were cleared up. That means that about 90,000 were either arrested, summonsed or cautioned for an offence. If one makes the broad assumption that of that 90,000 perhaps half or somewhat less will eventually be convicted, we are talking of about 40,000 people committing criminal damage and being convicted for it who would, at least potentially, be liable to the sanction in the clause. 1 doubt whether physical or corpora! punishment on that scale would make sense or would leave the authorities free from a whole chain of legal and other action from a minority of parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason why the new clause is unwise is that it states that the punishment is to be:
	<br><blockquote><p>"inflicted privately as soon as practicable after sentence."</p></blockquote>
The difficulty, as the Committee will appreciate, is that all forms of judicial punishment are open to appeal of some kind and are subject to the inevitable delays of justice. Nobody knows better than my hon. Friend just how delayed justice at different levels has become in recent years with the mounting crime wave and with the tendency of lawyers to talk at length. The idea of inflicting the punishment:
	<br><blockquote><p>"privately and as soon as practicable after sentence"</p></blockquote>
would be difficult to implement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third reason why I am persuaded that the clause is not satisfactory is the evidence adduced by the BMA, which has already been referred to by the hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill). It would be difficult in this country, bearing in mind the high ethical standards
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0537">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>723</span>
of the medical profession, to find anybody but the most voyeuristic or retributive doctor who would want to take part in that ceremony. I wonder whether the evidence from the BMA is not conclusive reason on its own for my hon. Friend thinking again about his new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fourth argument has already been touched upon. It concerns the response of offenders to such punishments and whether it is likely to deter. That was at the heart of the argument. Such a punishment, were it to be available to the courts, would be more likely on balance to create young heroes out of hooligans than to deter the youngsters. One must think about the category of youngsters about which one is talking. One is talking about youngsters who often spend much of their free time on the streets in company with other youngsters, whose main concern in life is to impress their peer group, their colleagues. If they can come back after such a punishment and demonstrate that it has not made a blind bit of difference to them, and they are just as full of bravado and virility as ever, I fear that it might have the opposite effect from that which my hon. Friend intends. There might be a tendency for young people to be inspired to go out and do the same again just to show that they were not put down by this form of punishment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that we could apply that criterion to any form of punishment for young people, and that those who return, for example, from detention centres could show just the same bravado, as those suffering from this form of punishment'? I cannot see the distinction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The distinction is that for many young offenders fortitude is prized highly among such groups of people. It is particularly true for young males and I know from such contact as I have had with youngsters that they put a high importance upon their ability to come through things physically and to be strong and brave in that sense. Therefore, a corporal punishment penalty would be particularly likely to give rise to such bravado.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the points about group status, personal advancement and corporate prestige also apply in a career structure I am sure that every member of the Committee will agree that it might be an idea if the Serjeant at Arms wrer empowered to adminsiter corporal punishment to MPs, on the instruction of the Speaker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The imagination boggles at the possibilities. I wondered earlier whether any of my hon. Friends who favour this form of punishment were on the verge of volunteering a demonstration to prove to the Committee and the public just how effective it can be. I was not willing to be tempted too far in that direction. So my fourth reason—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making an important point. Does he agree that one cannot say that nobody is deterred by the possibility of any form of punishment, whether it be capital, corporal or custodial,
	<span class='label label-info column'>724</span>
but is he not really saying that many people, particularly of the age group concerned, will have the opposite reaction? One has to balance the deterrent value against the incitement value in such a case. Is his point not that we simply cannot tell how the balance works out and that there is nothing to show that the deterrent value would be likely to be greater than the enhancement value?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and learned Gentleman emphasises my argument. He has brought out the basic underlying point which is that there is an element of doubt, to say the least, about many of arguments which are based on the theory of deterrence, whether one is talking of corporal or capital punishment to which the same argument applies a fortiori.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
hat expert committee of inquiry, the Cadogan Committee in 1938, and the Advisory Council in 1960 concluded that there was no evidence that judicial corporal punishment had ever been a particularly effective deterrent. I understand from what I gleaned from the Home Office that that is the view of the Home Office today. 1 look forward with interest to hearing what my hon. and learned Friend has to say. I imagine that there is no reason to change the view taken on those two exhaustive occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main conclusion is that the new clause, however much one may sympathise and understand the motivation of my hon. Friend and others who have put their name to it, should not be accepted. The Government would do well, none the less, to take up the constructive suggestion that it might be worth while to have another independent and expert inquiry into of corporal punishment, not least because, as has been pointed out some of my hon. Friends, the expert inquiries to which I have referred took place some time ago in rather different social conditions from those which pertain today. Such an inquiry, if it were soundly based and manned by the right people, would be likely to come to the same conclusion. The important point is that it would come to that conclusion on the basis of contemporary evidence and it would therefore go some way to allay the misgivings of my hon. Friends. For those reasons 1 cannot vote in favour of the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In spite of the findings of the Cadogan Committee, which has been recited to us by the hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon) and the opinion of various other bodies, such as the Institute of Psychiatry—and even the Isle of Man Attorney-General's supremely delphic judgment on this was recounted to us by the hon. Member who moved the new clause—1 approach the subject purely from personal experience and instinct. Any number of busy-bodies, whether they are individual or institutionalised, will give us their views, but hon. Members are elected to apply their experience and instinct to problems. A combination of these two convinces me that corporal punishment has a very strong deterrent effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not appropriate to give the Committee a recitation of experience from a variety of hon. Members on either side, but if they will bear with me I shall give two examples of when I suffered, endured or experienced— whichever verb they prefer for corporal punishment—for offences which were much more trivial than those set out in the new clause.

bag in prayers and for writing "not dusted" on a piece of dusty furniture. The first experience certainly deterred me from, or made me think twice about, interrupting formal proceedings of a ceremonial nature except when provoked unduly by, for example, the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk). The second experience taught me the most valuable lesson that the reception for an assertion of a truth depends on whether it is welcome or unwelcome to the recipient. Later on, when 1 was at Eton, there were three stages of corporal punishment, the earliest of which is the only one set out in this new clause. The two subsequent stages involved eight tannings, or pock tannings as they were known vulgary, when a very heavy cane with knobbles and notches was used. The third stage was when one was actually flogged; one had to take one's clothes off first. They were all available. Perhaps this is why Old Etonians are always acclaimed for their great courtesy.

Corporal punishment plainly represents the deterrent element in its very purest form. No one could claim that it was rehabilitative; no one could even claim the advantages—sometimes transient and sometimes, in the case of capital punishment, permanent—of removing the offender from his freedom to prey on society. No one could deny that the deterrent principle is a formidable factor in society's attitude to crime. I am always surprised when I hear intelligent hon. Gentlemen whose judgment I value and respect in many other fields discount completely the deterrent element. I honestly believe that if the Road Traffic Act were amended to make it mandatory that those who drive at more than 30 mph should be boiled in oil, traffic would move very slowly. One would have no difficulty in drafting such an amendment, rather on the lines of this one, saying that cast-iron vessels of certain dimensions should be filled with mineral oil of a minimum viscosity of SAE 15 and that at least 75 per cent, immersion of the convicted person should be endured at a temperature of 112°F for a certain time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a matter of degree, is it not, once one enters into deterrence in its purest form? I would ask my hon. Friends why not have an erection of wood in cruciform shape with manacles and clamps attached to it, to which the convicted person should be attached and then repeatedly flogged? Why not in a public place? Why a private place? Why not let those who might be minded to follow the convicted person's example hear his screams and the yells of exultation? One might even charge admission to this spectacle and bring some relief to the hard-pressed DHSS balance sheet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is quite common practice in certain Third world countries. I do not know whether they actually charge, although I think they do in Pakistan; one has to pay a nominal fee to get into the square, or wherever it happens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Watkins. I seek your guidance on the frivolity to which the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mr. Clark) is subjecting us. There is a certain insinuation in what he is saying-that the particular line that he is following has some thing to do with the new clause. His remarks over the last few moments have had nothing at all to do with the new clause. I wonder whether we are going off on another tangent completely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>726</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is expressing a point of view about the contents of the new clause. He has not said anything that is out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate what my hon. Friend says. Perhaps I have not made myself plain enough. The Committee is being very tolerant to me. 1 am quite convinced that the force of the deterrent element cannot be denied, but it has to be an element in a composite of our approach to criminality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this case it seems to me that it is present to the exclusion of all other elements. I seriously question whether those who argue its effectiveness admit it. I said that if we boiled motorists in oil the traffic would move more slowly. 1 suspect that if one did not give offenders what at one of the educational establishments I attended was called swishing in private, but did in fact manacle them to a cruciform structure in a public place and flogged them to within an inch of their lives, the deterrent element would be correspondingly higher.

I still feel that we must approach the subject with great caution. What we are doing, and the hon. Lady made the comment, is institutionalising violence. I think this punishment is essential in the family, and may be required at school, but in both instances it is administered by people who know and often love the child or young person to whom it is administered. It should be suffered by someone who, we hope, respects and knows the person giving the punishment. The removal from that intimate environment where, in spite of the highly progressive habits in the household of the hon. Member for Croydon, North-West (Mr. Pitt), it is a widespread and familiar element in the happy evolution and development of family life and has been for milennia. To take it out of that context and institutionalise and depersonalise it, and have it administered anonymously—leaving aside all questions of immediacy and doctors and so on—brings in the fundamental element of making the State responsible. I maintain that such punishment should be private and dealt with in the context of personal knowledge and experience, or we shall breach an important barrier which society, by mutual consent, has allowed to arise over the past century.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many people will be sympathetic with my hon. Friend's view that when this punishment is administered in a family it is in an intimate atmosphere. But I question what my hon. Friend said on the intimate atmosphere extending to a school. He referred to corporal punishment administered by the State. Clearly, the atmosphere in a school is somewhat different from that in a court, which is entirely unpersonalised. On that basis, would it not be useful for the Committee to consider that corporal punishment in a detention centre, a borstal or in some form of custody, could be administered, because there would be the same atmosphere as in a school? I cannot see the distinction between the punishment being administered by a particular person, apart from a member of the family, which I accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a distinction. By closed societies, I mean microcosms of a family type, where the person
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0539">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>727</span>
receiving the punishment and the person administering it, are known to each other. Their previous history and their behavioural characteristics are known to each other. The sense of justice which is prevalent in all communities, however rough or disorderly, will also be present. If I express an opinion on the use of such punishment in penal institutions, I should be out of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic principle of whether such punishment should be administered anonymously and impersonally and at the behest of the State, whether it remains, as I believe, a legitimate recourse in the context of personal knowledge and acquaintance, is an important one. When the decline of standards, greater criminality, and the onset of lawlessness show no signs of receding, society may have to break that barrier again and have to think seriously of the gamut of retaliatory and retributive punishments at its disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were convinced that we had reached that point, I would support the provision to a greater degree than is embodied in the new clause. At present, however, I do not think that we have reached that condition. There are serious dangers of degradation if we revert at this stage. I am not convinced that the effects would be as magical as many of the proponents claim. For that reason I cannot support the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have voted against it, but I was shocked to find that the vote on this subject is regarded as a fitting subject for party discipline or, if the Committee will not think that I am jesting, of party Whipping. I feel strongly that this should be for the individual to decide. It is grossly improper that the intrusion of party should apply. For that reason, although I shall attend the debate in full as I have until now, I shall not vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to support the new clause in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Mr. Hawksley), and to congratulate him on his comprehensive speech, punctuated—in some cases unnecessarily—by hon. Members of the Opposition with various frivolous points, which rather reduced the force of his argument in a frivolity not fitting to the Committee. I am proud to be one of the sponsors of the clause, which is supported by 23 Government Members and has, the support of the vast majority of the people in this country. Certainly, my own constituents have overwhelmed me with post and support, and I have not had one letter against it since my views were known. My hon. Friend has caught the public mood in presenting a real alternative form of deterrent and punishment. It is necessary and right that the Committee should consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale (Mr. Trippier) said, urgent action is called for. Even over the last few days, when my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has been engaged in discussion as to what policies should be adopted, I was somewhat disappointed to hear that both he and my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister did not think that this form of punishment should be available to the magistrates' courts. On that and on several other points I disagree with my right hon. Friend, and I hope that the Committee will see fit to put the clause into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us, and still more, many of our constituents, have first-hand knowledge of the crimes that have been
	<span class='label label-info column'>728</span>
committed that the new clause would help to counteract I can say to Opposition Members that in no sense are those of us who supported the clause baying for blood—a term used on a previous occasion. I believe that today we are debating a principle. The technical details are clearly necessary, and my hon. Friend is right to have put them into the new clause, because if he had not. Opposition Members would have jumped up and made great play over the lack of those technical details. We are arguing a principle which is of intense interest to many outside the House. Consequently, we should consider it in a rather more serious vein than that in which some hon. Members have taken it so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would prove, in my belief, an effective deterrent, and I am not ashamed to say that it is a punishment which should be inflicted upon those who offend against society in this particular way. I have no doubt that we are right to assume that such pain as would be inflicted upon them is their just desert for the pain which they inflict upon others. It is for me an apt time for the clause to come up, representing as I do the county of Bedfordshire, because our own police committee has just produced its 1981 report, which shows that of the increasing crimes in the county, 30 per cent, are now committed by youths and girls under 17. This is the category which we are discussing today, and most of those, I regret to say, come from the town of Luton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is aimed at various offenders, as shown by the various categories listed in it. The first and most important category of offenders is those who commit a physical assault upon others. We have reached a stage now where street offences and muggings are almost too numerous and too frequent to report in local papers. The figures for London published a few days ago come as no surprise to those of us who represent constituencies in large urban areas. We are not surprised to hear that gangs of youths—bullies, in effect —are beginning to terrorise our society to a frightening extent, where old and even young people are not able to walk the streets of our towns and cities in safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendall) is right—and this is highlighted by the report— to say that the present position has arisen because of changes in the makeup of the urban communities. There is now a racial element in many crimes and we should not be afraid to discuss that. I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary for allowing the figures to be published as he has.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made his statutory racialist point. The only place in the country where ethnic monitoring of crime takes place is London. The areas of poverty in London are coterminous with the areas where blacks live. The ad hoc studies, in Manchester for example, show clearly that the representation of blacks among offenders against the law is much below the representation of whites. It happens that the Metropolitan figures refer to areas which are very heavily populated by black people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon) for raising that point. I hesitate to correct him in his deep knowledge, but I shall quote from page 32 of the Annual Report of the Chief Constable of Bedfordshire for 1918, to show that the figures outside London are broken down. He says in his
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0540">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>729</span>
report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The majority of all robberies, 107, were committed in Luton where 40–37.4 percent.—were committed by black youths."</p></blockquote>
Luton is 40 miles from London but it is stated in that report that more black youths than white youths committed robberies there in 1981.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is concerned to see good race relations preserved. If the new clause formed part of the law of the land, and if these punishments were inflicted—bearing in mind the point about the high incidence of black youths committing crimes—would there not be a real risk to good race relations if black youths were frequently punished in this way by white policeman?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made a telling point but I do not think we should shy away from the fact that since 1948—which is the year that has been bandied about in the Committee—the situation has changed. Now three to four million people with non-white skin and of non-white origin in some way make up part of the criminal statistics. Obviously they offend, as others do. The point that this report—and indeed the report of my own county—highlights is that the number of black youths offending is out of proportion with the number of white youths who also offend. We should not be ashamed to say so. The figures produced—certainly those in the report that we were talking about—bore that point out. and my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is absolutely right to allow the figures to be published.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figures for Brixton, which were provided by the Metropolitan Police, show that in an area where 50 per cent, of the teenage population is black, the proportion of black youths offending is about 60 per cent. The margin is much closer than the hon. Gentleman suggests, and when he talks about the ad hoc figure that is produced by the Chief Constable of Bedford, perhaps he should recognise, as I do, that if we are go to into the ethnic monitoring of crime in London we should go into the ethnic monitoring of crime throughout the country so that it is perfectly clear where the balance lies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not frightened of the facts, but I would argue with the hon. Gentleman and the Chief Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police that we should have the full facts so that a proper judgment can be made about racial involvement in crime. I recognise that this is outside the terms of the argument today, but since the hon. Gentleman has dragged it in for the purpose of his own racialist campaign. I must say that I am totally opposed to the suggestion he is making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not go down that road, but I agree with a lot of what the hon. and learned Gentleman has said. I take exception to his remark that the figures are ad hoc and I shall certainly give him a copy of the report when the Committee adjourns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is also aimed at the youths in our towns and cities who are perpetrating crimes of violence against each other and, indeed, against those who are not able to defend themselves. I shall quote briefly from the report about an incident that occurred
	<span class='label label-info column'>730</span>
in Bedford last year which the Chief Constable describes as an incident of "mindless violence". He speaks of when in May
	<br><blockquote><p>"about 250 young people attended a punk rock concert. The stage was invaded by a number of skinheads who physically threw the performers into the audience. There followed extremely violent scenes, during which damage in excess of £3,000 was caused.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>At the height of this incident every available officer from Bedford and the surrounding area was directed (o the scene, and 13 were injured."</p></blockquote>
such instances are occurring in our towns and cities. One occurred in a town next to my constituency only last week. That causes Conservative Members supporting this clause to feel that if there was a deterrent by way of the short, sharp shock treatment of corporal punishment then many such youths would think twice before perpetrating crimes of physical violence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is destroying the validity of much of what he said in the earlier part of his speech. Of course, every hon. Member is extremely concerned by individual acts of violence perpetrated against old and defenceless people, whether it is accompanied by robbery or not. My hon. Friend goes on to try and enlist our sympathy in an instance where a spontaneous outburst of indignation among certain sections of an audience led to an attack on offensive and obscene performers who had tried their patience for too long. I simply do not think that the two cases are in any way comparable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend puts me in mind of the scenes at Lords two years ago when the umpires decided that the game should not restart after the rain and some members of the MCC violently shook the umpires—the performers in that case. I give him that example because what I described was not spontaneous indignation. It was 250 skinhead scum—which is all that they are basically—fighting against each other and committing acts of criminal damage against a property and their fellows. Whether their fellows were of similar ilk is not for us to judge. The fact is that every policeman in the Bedford area was called to that centre and who knows what crimes went on while the youths were fighting, in many cases among themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend represents a constituency with one of the lesser football teams and he will know that on a Saturday afternoon when the ground is situated, as it is in my constituency, right in the heart of the town constituents are terrorised by young thugs and hooligans purporting to follow football. The town is not a safe place on a Saturday afternoon let alone, regrettably the ground itself for any decent citizens. These mischevous people are out just to cause trouble and in a bravado sense—and I use the words of my hon. Friend for Carshalton (Mr. Forman)—to offend against decent ordinary citizens. That is why we need this clause to deter them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to come between two hon. Gentlemen in their private quarrel, but since the hon. Gentleman has referred to an incident to which he obviously attaches a great deal of importance, can he tell us whether they were white skinheads or black skinheads?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can tell the right hon. and learned
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0541">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>731</span>
Gentleman that they were white skinheads because I have not come across a black skinhead, but perhaps the right hon. and learned Gentleman knows that such people exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us not become frivolous about the type of people they are. They arc a scourge on society and receive much opposition—and should do—from every member of this House and from the public. The sooner they are run off the face of this country, by whatever means, the better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to clear up this point. Do they appear in the report as white skinheads or are they broken down into colours?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall quote again from the report of the chief constable:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The stage was invaded by a number of skinheads".</p></blockquote>
I say to the hon. and learned Gentleman that it is a pity that sometimes the Committee cannot take pictorial evidence because a photograph appeared in my local paper last week of a concert at the Queensway Hall. Dunstable of a mob of white skinheads of varying ages between about eight and 18—some of them are as young as that—and they did untold damage to that hall and. of course, untold damage to themselves. The latter I do not query too much except that the police have to come and sort them out when they could be doing other things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move to another part of the new clause. Subsection (1)(c) seems to have come in for a certain amount of criticism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must continue to harass my hon. Friend. He is asking us to accept his new clause and one of the examples he is giving us is an incident at a concert. He said that the youths committed "untold damage" to the hall and also to themselves—the latter I do not care about very much. I find that shocking enough but the fact that we are asked to endorse corporal punishment because the promoters of a concert, knowing full well the kind of clients that they were going to invite and. more importantly, the kind of money they were going to make out of the affair, should have suffered some damage to their own property seems to me to be extending the argument into territory that the Committee should reject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understood and had great difficulty in rejecting the argument that corporal punishment should be brought back as a form of deterrent to protect the vulnerable, the elderly and those in acute danger of personal violence from a certain type of criminal. That we should be asked to endorse it to defend the property interests of the promoters of pop concerts seems to me to be utterly preposterous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bendall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that those who go to pop concerts are not all skinheads and that often innocent people can quickly become involved in something in which they had no intention of becoming involved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must support what my hon. Friend says. The hon. Member for Croydon. Northwest has talked about our daughters. I have a 14-year
	<span class='label label-info column'>732</span>
old daughter who supports a pop group called Haircut 100 which has nothing to do with skinheads and she is not able to go to the concerts which this group gives because of the very thing that I am talking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I can draw this back to the new clause. I think it is absolutely necessary that these yobs and hooligans, skinheads or whatever are taught a lesson which they will not forget, whether they are offending against themselves or against property and whether the promoters of a concert have made financial provision to cope with the damage. That is what the new clause is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I go back to subsection (1)(c), which has caused some interest and misgivings to hon. Members about whether this form of punishment should be available to those who:
	<br><blockquote><p>"commit an act of criminal damage".</p></blockquote>
Vandalism in our towns and cities has risen quite alarmingly at enormous cost to the various local authorities and to the Government. As has been said when telephone kiosks are destroyed or put out of action, it can at times put lives at risk. The telling cost in both human and financial terms of the continuing vandalism must be stopped. There are very few places one can go to now in any large urban conurbation and find buildings that are not desecrated with some form of graffiti, and windows that are not smashed, particularly those of empty buildings. If this punishment was available to the courts after such wanton damage had been created, it would be a very strong deterrent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I understand that the hon. Gentleman's argument now is that whipping should apply to persons convicted of criminal damage related to the writing of graffiti? Is that what he says?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to argue with the hon. Gentleman, who clearly has great knowledge of these matters, but if the courts decided that the writing of graffiti was wanton damage—in some cases it could damage a particular building not necessarily beyond repair, but certainly at great cost—this provision should be available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About the subsection on provocative language I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. Too many times in public places offenders are using offensive and obscene language, particularly on sporting occasions. It is right that they should be brought before the court and that this particular form of punishment should be inflicted upon them. Only today we hear from Marks and Spencer that its assistants are now being so harrassed and abused by intending shoplifters that it has had to issue a code of practice to them because they are very frightened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To those who criticise the Bill, as many hon. Members have done, quite understandably—it is the first time we on the Government side have seen the Opposition united—and say that it is no deterrent because of figures produced in 1948, I would reiterate the argument that that was 34 years ago. There have been enormous changes in our society since then. Regrettably, we are breeding hooligans who clearly were not in existence at that time. We have racial troubles, whatever the hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon) would like to say. Young West Indians and others do riot; we saw it on our streets so sadly last summer. Many of us believe that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0542">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>733</span>
since it has not been tried for such a length of time—I am not convinced by any argument about what goes on on the Continent—this form of deterrent should be available to the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question of the length of time since we had a commission has been raised so many times. Is the hon. Gentleman aware that in the Isle of Man case before the European Court the representatives of the Isle of Man had full opportunity to present their arguments? They rested their arguments to a large degree on what they claimed to be the deterrent effect of this penalty. This was their case; they were not suggesting that they were being kind to the people concerned, but that it deterred. This was part of the matter which the court considered and set against the arguments on the other side. The court took the view that it was simply not satisfied that the deterrent effect was such as to justify this penalty. Is not that something that ought to be said in relation to recent consideration of this type of penalty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It should also be said that since birching was withdrawn from the Isle of Man—and I shall not go down that road, which has been well covered by my hon. Friend—the number of offences previously punishable by birching has actually increased. To the critics of the new clause who accuse Conservative Members of being bloodthirsty, I say unashamedly that this pain must be inflicted upon others. Those who mug old ladies, as described in my hon. Friend's examples, show no mercy to their victims. I suggest that we should show no mercy to them. I am sure it would have a deterrent effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that smacks of retribution, I say, again unashamedly, that I think there ought to be some retribution in such cases, for the sake of the victims and for the sake of satisfying the public that the judiciary vis a vis the Government is fully aware of our problems, and that such people will not be allowed to get away with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If, after the reintroduction of corporal punishment, the figures showed that it was not a deterrent, would the hon. Gentleman suggest that the number of strokes should be increased, the width of the rod increased, and so. on? At what stage would one decide that more and more pain should be inflicted? Will the hon. Gentleman answer that question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I shall answer the hon. and learned Member's question. On the basis of today, we do not inflict any pain at all. I do not think that the degree of pain, after a certain number of lashes and so on, is relevant. There is a stark difference between those who get no pain at all and those who then suffer the pain. Consequently, until we begin to make the offenders suffer that pain again, it is a fallacious argument to talk about how many actual lashes they should be given and how effective they may be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the number of lashes is irrevelant, why does the hon. Gentleman specify 12 in one case and six in another? He must have a good reason for putting in those numbers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>734</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The irrelevance, in the original comment made by the hon. and learned Member, was the numbers of lashes over the numbers specified in the new clause. I myself suffered corporal punishment—unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton, 1 shall not list my offences—and I have administered corporal punishment upon others, and the punishment was a deterrent to me when I was inflicted with it, and to those on whom I inflicted it. To those who say that such punishment is inhumane, I say this. Is it not a fact that in the world of nature the adult animal actually cuffs its young? There is nothing inhumane about a senior partner in a family admonishing its young in the particular way in which it wishes to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the precise distinction that I and others made between domestic corporal punishment, for which a powerful and traditional case can be made, and judicial corporal punishment which falls foul of many of the difficulties set out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already said, in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton, that I accept that argument within the family. Someone mentioned freedom of choice. I think that that freedom should, and does, exist. To go a little further from the hon. Member's argument and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton, if there is acceptance that such punishment should be administered in a school, I do not see a great distinction in its being administered outside the school. I think that the provision of the new clause, available to the magistrates, would have more effect on the victims and on the offenders than we dare think of in the Committee.

My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has made provision for two centres for short, sharp, shock treatment, and there are two more to come. There is nothing shorter, sharper or, perhaps in a way more shocking to those on whom it is inflicted, than this form of punishment. Some way should be found whereby such punishment could be given to the offenders as soon after the offence as possible. The amount of time between the offence and the punishment inflicted is certainly too long at present. During the summer riots, the main complaint of the police was that the youths and girls who were taken into custody were not to face a court for some three or four months—the length of time diminished the punishment which they were given and made it far more difficult for the police to make the charges stick.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wants his argument to be taken seriously, does he not recognise the long period between conviction, sentence and the appeal procedure—the application for relief and the appeal actually being heard? He must deal with this point if he wants to be taken seriously. If six to nine months elapse between the date of the conviction and the hearing of the appeal, which is not unusual, is he seriously advocating that the whippings should be postponed until the appeal has been dismissed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made the very point that concerns me, and also many hon. Members on both sides of the House, that the length of time—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>735</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ryman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman obviously has not followed the argument. One cannot impose the sentence and make it effective, if it is a sentence of this kind, if one docs not give an opportunity for appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to argue with a lawyer about the length of time it takes to bring an offence to court and for judgment to be given. I take the point, but there is real concern about the length of time. That is why, if the new clause were accepted, the provision of this punishment would be far more effective if it could be administered in as short a time after the offence as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Blythe (Mr. Ryman) was saying that, if the right of appeal was allowed to remain in the event of corporal punishment being inflicted, it would be impossible to have it inflicted within a short period. Would my hon. Friend agree with me when 1 comment that the punishment which is being proposed is a similar punishment to that which would be inflicted at the moment by a headmaster, against whom there is no appeal, and that therefore it would not be out of the question to consider removing the right of appeal in this case also?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely support what my hon. Friend has said, because 1 believe that if this punishment is to be etfective it must be delivered within a short period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is responding to the point made by his hon. Friend, he will probably agree with me that, in relation to the deterrent effect on other people, it makes no difference at all whether the person concerned is guilty or innocent of the offence. The fact that it is done is sufficient deterrent in itself.

	<span class='label label-info column'>736</span>
Perhaps he would take the view that an appeal is totally unnecessary because the fact that the sentence is awarded is sufficient in itself to deter other people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate at this stage of my speech, having followed three eminent lawyers, to make any further comment on that aspect. I will conclude by saying that 1 believe that the court should have at its disposal the means of speaking to these young offenders, of whatever description, in the language that they understand. The language that they use is to inflict pain upon others. We should, as a judiciary, be able to inflict that pain upon them, and 1 believe that, if the clause receives the acceptance of the Committee, not only would it be warmly welcomed by the whole of the country but it would probably be one of the most effective deterrents that we have in the very sad times in which we are living.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Watkins. It would probably be for the convenience of the Committee if we were to adjourn. May I give notice now that, since on Thursday afternoon at the request of the Opposition we shall be having a debate on the Floor of the House on a matter in which most, if not all, members of the Committee will be interested. 1 shall propose at the end of the morning's sitting on Thursday that the Committee meet next on Tuesday 30 March at half-past Ten o'clock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Debate adjourned.[Mr. Mayhew.]</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Adjourned accordingly at Four minutes to One o'clock till this day at half-past Four o'clock.</i></p>
