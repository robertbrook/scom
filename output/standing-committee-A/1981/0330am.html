	<section>
	<div class='title'>Curfew orders</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, where a person under 21 but not less than 10 years of age is convicted of an offence which is punishable with imprisonment in the case of a person aged 21 or over, the court may make an order confining the offender to his place of permanent residence for such hours of any day and for such day or days of the week as they think fit; provided that:—
	<ol>
	<li>where the offender resides with his parent or guardian such parent or guardian has consented to the order;</li>
	<li>where the offender resides in the care of any other person or authority such person or authority has consented to the order;</li>
</ol>
	<ol>
	<li>An order under this section shall be known as a "Curfew Order".</li>
	<li>The periods within a day within which confinement may be imposed under this section shall be:—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>Mondays to Fridays—6 p.m. until 6 a.m. on the following day;</li>
	<li>Saturdays and Sundays—noon until 6 a.m. on the following day.</li>
</ol>
	<li>The maximum duration of such an order shall be three months. The maximum number of days within such a period of three months shall be 42.</li>
	<li>Where such an order has been made and it appears on information to a justice acting for a relevant petty sessional area that the offender has been in breach of the order, the justice may issue a summons requiring the offender to appear at a place and time specified in the summons before a magistrates' court acting for the area or, if the information is in writing and on oath, may issue a warrant for the offender's arrest requiring him to be brought before the court.</li>
	<li>If it is proved to the satisfaction of the magistrates' court before which the offender is brought under this section that he has without reasonable excuse been in breach of the order then that court may—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>impose upon the offender any sentence or make any order which it might have imposed or made for the original offence of which he was convicted; or</li>
	<li>commit the offender to the Crown Court for sentence.</li>
</ol>
	<li>A magistrates' court which deals with an offender's case under subsection 6(6) of this section shall send to the Crown Court a certificate signed by a justice of the peace giving particulars of the offender's breach of the order together with other particulars as may be desirable, and a certificate purporting to be so signed shall be admissible as evidence of the breach before the Crown Court.</li>
	<li>Where by virtue of subsection (6)(6) above the offender is brought or appears before the Crown Court and it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that he has been in breach of the order, the Court may impose upon the offender any sentence or make any order which it might have imposed or made for the original offence of which he was convicted.</li>
	<li>Nothing in this section shall prevent a court imposing an order under this section in addition to other penalties that it is empowered to impose.</li>
	<li>In proceedings before a Crown Court under this section any question whether there has been a breach of the order shall be determined by a court and not by the verdict of a jury.</li>
	<li>The provisions of section 55 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 shall not apply to penalties provided for under this section."—	<i>(Mr. Lyell.)</i></li>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>814</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Lyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemel Hempstead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to continue my remarks on new clause 57, the curfew clause. I had outlined the objects of the new clause, the way in which broadly it would operate, and its provenance and origins, which are quite formidable. This morning I should like to deal with one or two of the points that have been raised by those who, quite rightly, have brought to our attention some of the possible difficulties with the new clause so that we can consider them, and also to deal with one or two of the points raised by hon. Members in the course of the debate last week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To start with a point that is rather on the fringes but which is of some interest, the new clause does go up to the age of 20, as at present drafted, and it has been pointed out by the hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) that it is possible that someone who was considered under the new clause might even be married.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is probably rather on the fringes of the kind of case where the justices would be thinking of using such a provision, but it does not necessarily rule out its suitability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Curiously enough, with a rather weak-minded husband and a reasonably strong-minded wife and proper consultation within the courts, one can foresee that it could actually be used quite usefully in those circumstances. Questions of that nature, which are important, not only in the context of the new clause but within the whole framework of the Bill, remind us that the object of the Bill is to give the courts—and with this new clause we are thinking particularly of magistrates—a wide range of choices from which to draw an appropriate penalty in a particular case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me to some of the other points which have been raised by other people who have helpfully commented upon the new clause in draft. The point has been made more than once that the courts would wish to know a certain amount about the home situation of the offender before imposing the provisions of the new clause. I wholly agree with that view. Indeed, I would have thought that it was entirely within the spirit of the Committee's deliberations as a whole that courts should be well informed, not only about the offence but about the offender, before they impose almost any of the penalties which are made available. It is certainly my experience in the courts that at all levels they go to a great deal of trouble to seek to inform themselves. I know that all of us, from my hon. Friends to the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk), will welcome the fact that that is happening, because it is exactly what he always seeks to encourage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to whether the new clause should cover young people between the age of 17 to 20, I have had the opportunity of a good deal of discussion on this aspect with a number of people, both in the social services and probation service, with members of the police force and with a number of magistrates. Is is only fair to say that there is a divided view about it, but members of all those branches either of the services or of the judiciary have expressed to me the fact that they know of cases where above the age of 17 it could nevertheless be extremely useful. Indeed, in one case it was asked why stop at 20.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the written submissions that we have received suggests that in some way it is inequitable to those under 20 that this possibility should be open when it is not open to those over 20. I do not know that we need
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0589">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>815</span>
dwell on that particular aspect for very long because a great many things are made available for jeveniles which are not made available for adult offenders, and vice versa, but I am satisfied that there would be a significant number of cases in the 17-to-20 age band where this kind of restraint, coupled with continued parental control, even if the parent were no longer legally liable—as they would not be for the fines—could be beneficial. We would certainly be deluding ourselves if we thought that all young people were away from home and away from the influence of parents, or that we wished them to be away from the influence of parents, as soon as they reached the age of 17. I ask the Committee to continue to look favourably on the new clause covering young people between the ages of 17 and 20, albeit that hon. Members may wish between now and Report to have further consultation on that aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A sensible point has been raised as to a power of variation or discharge so that if, in the course of the three months, something which had not been foreseen —I do not go so far as to say was not foreseeable, but something in the young peron's circumstances which had not been foreseen—made it necessary for that young person not to remain at home during the hours which the justices or the court had ordered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one were redrawing the new clause between now and Report stage, that would be a wholly sensible provision to consider. I doubt whether it would be used very often, but that kind of opportunity to vary the terms or even to discharge them in appropriate circumstances, even over that fairly limited period of three months, might be useful and might give greater flexibility and therefore greater value to the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal with a few more detailed points. The question of the consent of the offender has been raised. When I initially drafted the new clause with the assistance of my hon. Friend and other hon. Members, I put in that the consent of the offender should be required. This shows how there is scope for difference of opinion. The helpful comments that I have received from one of the branches of the social services suggested that it might be inappropriate to have the consent of the offender. I say against myself in the context of the immediate drafting of the new clause that currently I am rather inclined to replace the provision for the consent of the offender for all ages from 10 upwards, though it is quite possible to consider a cut-off point at 14, not to require consent between 10 and 13 and to require consent between 14 and 17.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is made to me by probation officers—and I think it an extremely sensible one—that the fact that the young person has had to give his or her mind to the sentence that might be imposed, and has had to give that consent, draws to their attention their responsibility in the matter. One of the central features and philosophies behind this new clause is the recognition of responsibility, both in the young person and in the parent. So I would not be unsympathetic if the new clause came back with consent at all ages restated within it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.S. C. Silkin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dulwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. and learned Gentleman will explain one point about which I am not clear. The new clause as it stands requires the consent of the parent or guardian or other person Is the purpose of that provision based upon parental
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>816</span>
responsibility or upon the simple practical point that one really could not require someone to be kept in a dwelling or other place that does not belong to that person? One would have to have the consent of the person who is the owner or tenant. Or is it intended to be a mixture of both?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is that it is intended to be a mixture of both. Subsection (l)(a) provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"where the offender resides with his parent or guardian such parent or guardian has consented."</p></blockquote>
I think that answers the second part of the right hon. and learned Gentleman's query. It is only when they are residing with the parent or guardian that the consent is regarded as appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, in broad terms, the answer to the right hon. and learned Gentleman's question is both, both the fact that the parent has a responsibility which it is the object of this new clause to highlight and reinforce, and the fact that for practical success of a new clause such as this, the recognition of that responsibility which is implied in consent is a valuable adjunct. I think that I can deal quite generally with the right hon. and learned Gentleman's sensible point and say that the answer is clearly both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point about the hours has been raised and whether to make is possible for a curfew to run between 6 pm and 6 am might have some effect 'on a person's ability to do his job. That brings me back very much to the point I was making a few minutes ago, that the court will want to know a reasonable amount about the home background and the work, or otherwise, of the offender before it imposes the provisions of the new clause. The court will be giving its mind as to which of the hours are the relevant hours between which to impose the curfew. I concede that one would not impose the curfew right through until 6 am, particularly where a young person got up at 5.30 to go to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the court would ever be so stupid. Once it gets used to using provisions of this nature, it will, if common sense has not already told it instantly— which I stongly suspect that it will—make inquiries as to whether the offender goes to work very early in the morning. In such a case, of course, it would be stupid to impose a curfew.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings one back to one of the attractions of the new clause—its flexibility. The same point was made with regard to Saturday afternoons and the fact that a young person might be doing a paper round. If it were thought appropriate to keep him away from a football match but not from a paper round—and one is getting into a great deal of detail here—the court has all the discretion necessary to temper the hours so as to achieve that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to interrupt, but I think that my hon. and learned Friend has misunderstood my query. It was not so much whether the hours of the offender made it difficult or unsuitable for such apenalty to be imposed upon him or her, but whether the j ob and social circumstances of the parents were such—through working shifts or unsocial hours—as to make it difficult for them to enforce the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Yes, I had misunderstood him. I am sorry, but the ambit of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0590">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>817</span>
what I was saying covers that point. In using the new clause, which is intended to knit the bond between the parent and the offspring, one will be looking at the circumstances of both.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why is it necessary to write into the new clause a specific time? If the hon. and learned Gentleman wants to give flexibility to the court, why not leave it to the court?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is wise to write in specific times, otherwise courts might gain the impression that Parliament envisaged much longer and more blanket periods of curfew, and they are certainly not envisaged by me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S.C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause itself imposes a limit or maximum. What does it matter how that maximum, or less than maximum, is disposed of? Surely, as the hon. and learned Gentleman's hon. Friend has put it, it must depend upon the circumstances both of the person concerned and of the parents. It is difficult to follow why one should be confined to the particular time laid down in the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can explain why it is confined and I hope that the common sense will commend itself to the Committee. It is confined to what are broadly regarded as evenings and weekends, which are times when the parent or guardian is likely to be at home, back from work and available to perform the duty. I quite see in broad theory that one could remove those hours, but it is more sensible to give guidance. Certainly, the magistrates felt that this was the appropriate way in which to approach it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many social workers and probation officers who support the new clause, and to whom I have spoken, feel that this is a perfectly sensible framework to give effect to the objects which I have put forward. I hope that that answers the right hon. and learned Gentleman, even if he thinks that it could go more broadly. That is a view which I respect, but with which I do not agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vivian Bendall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ilford North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. and learned Friend not agree that the hours he has suggested, particularly so far as school children are concerned are the hours more likely for them to get into further trouble? Certainly on Saturday afternoons those not at school or work are more likely to get into trouble.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. That indeed encapsulates another aspect of the thinking behind the new clause and is exactly the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come finally to the matter of enforcement by the police. It is a subject which rightly concerns the Committee. The possibility has been raised that it might be enforced by the police by going to the homes of offenders. That has been raised in order to indicate—I certainly have not met anyone who thought that particularly desirable—that that is not a road down which we should wish to go. Certainly it is a matter on which one may wish to take more views from the police. But speaking for myself, without the benefit of those further views, though I have some views from the police, I do not think that we would want to involve
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>818</span>
them in knocking on the doors of the homes of private citizens to find out whether somebody was at home. That is not necessary to the enforcement of the new clause and I am not proposing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other question which is rather more open to difference of view—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Kilroy-Silk 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ormskirk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While the hon. and learned Gentleman is not proposing that particular measure, is it not likely that in the enforcement of such a proposal the police will be likely to involve themselves in far more random stops and searches along the lines of the now discredited and repealed sus law? Would not the introduction of such a curfew order result in all the harassment of young people that we have tried to get rid of with the sus law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the simple answer is "No, it would not."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is whether it should be an immediately arrestable offence to be in breach of curfew, which centres on the point raised by the hon. Gentleman. I think that it is not necessary. The justices and those to whom I have spoken think that it is not necessary. We are dealing with circumstances where we seek to reinforce the responsibility of parents where it is clear that breaches are likely to be followed by the rapid return of the young offender to the haunts and habits which brought him or her into trouble and which will rapidly cause them to come to notice again. That is likely to provide an adequate and effective method of enforcement of the new clause. I intend for the moment to leave it at that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have outlined in some detail the object of the new clause. Its basic object is to provide one additional measure within the quiver-full of measures with which this effective and beneficial Bill provides the courts. Its second object is to reinforce something which we all wish—the responsibility of parents. I believe that it will do that and I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Dubs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I first considered this proposal and had long discussions with magistrates about it, I was quite keen on the idea. However, the more I have gone into the implications of the new clause and how the curfew would operate in practice, the more reluctant am I to give it my wholehearted support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not mean that I am totally against the idea, but I do have serious misgivings. At one level, I see nothing wrong in principle with a measure intended to keep young persons, particularly children of school age, off the streets late at night. Most parents would also support the measure and be keen not to have their children on the streets late at night. That is a general view which I think commands widespread support. However, the more one looks at the new clause, the more doubts one has about whether that will be the only thing it will do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I am reluctant to support the idea of the word "curfew" which, because of its implications, I should not have used in this measure. "Curfew" has undesirable connotations of martial law which could have been avoided by using a different term such as "a home restriction order". But that does not go to the heart of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0591">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>819</span>
the argument, it is simply the way in which it is perceived in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first reservation about the new clause is the age band. The hon. and learned Gentleman said that representations had been made to him about the age limits both by people who thought they should be lower and by people who thought that there should be no age restriction. I should have thought that at the very most the top age should be 17. Indeed, I think it would be sensible to confine this proposal to young people of school age. Anything beyond that gets us into enormous difficulties with people who are married, people who are shift workers, people who go out to youth clubs, recreational activities and so on. We should therefore confine the new clause to school age.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Compulsory school age?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mean up to the limit of compulsory school age only, that is up to the age of 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman said several times that this proposal would support the responsibilities of parents. That is fair enough, but the more one goes above the age of 16 the less relevant that consideration becomes. People of 17 or 18 may have left home, they may be married and have nothing to do with any parent or guardian. The objective of reinforcing parental responsibility can hardly be met by applying it to people who are over 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also very concerned about the time limits proposed in the new clause. The hon, and learned Gentleman put in all sorts of reservations and said simply that these were the widest limits. Nevertheless, if there is to be any chance of the proposal working, it could only apply after 10 o'clock at night. It could certainly not apply to the very wide hours referred to from noon onwards on Saturdays and Sundays. That is unrealistic and it evades the difficulty that many people who may come under this proposal have home conditions which are hardly conducive to their being kept at home for such long hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is an overcrowded home and conditions are not very satisfactory, that would make life for the family even more difficult. To expect young people to be restricted to these hours would only encourage them to be in breach of the order.

The next difficulty is whose responsibility is it, if anybody's, to notify the police if there are breaches of the order? If the order is imposed with the consent of the parents, does this impose on the parents a responsibility to tell the police that the young person to whom the order applies has left home during the hours when the curfew is in force? That will put parents into a very difficult position and will cause friction and tension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might give the parents more power as long as the order is being obeyed by the offender. At the point when the young person says bluntly " I shall
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>820</span>
not stay at home, I am going out " or does not reappear at home by whatever time the curfew is imposed, what are the parents to do? Are they to phone up the police station and say " My son Jimmy aged 14 has not come home by 6 o'clock in the evening"? If they cannot impose discipline through their own persuasive powers, are they to be put in the invidious position of conniving at a breach of the law by not reporting their son to the police? It would be a very dangerous pass if we were to put parents into the odious position of having to report their children to the police knowing that the consequence may well be that their children will be taken into custody.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nantwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I accept what the hon. Gentleman says—nobody would wish parents to report their offspring to the police—there is a parallel already where parents go to the courts and say they have lost control of their own children. In some circumstances this is both desirable and necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, in certain extreme cases parents will say they have lost control of their children. However, the implications of this curfew order go much wider than that. It would put parents into an invidious and virtually impossible position, because they could have to report their children to the police.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bendall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman not agree that in many cases it might put the onus of responsibility back on to the parents, where it belongs, and make many more parents responsible where hitherto they were irresponsible?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never argued that parents should not be responsible for their young children. But this proposal covers people up to the age of 21, and to expect parents to have that sort of responsibility for, say, a young man of 18 is very different from parents having responsibility for children of, say, 11 or 12-years-old. I repeat that it would put parents into an impossible position, one which would cause more conflicts within the family and further breakdowns in the relationships between parents and their children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend when he says that parents would be placed in an invidious position in the circumstances of the order being made. But would they not be placed in an invidious position from the very start? The parents will have to give their consent before this can be operated at all, and presumably both parents if both are living at home. My hon. Friend may wish to envisage the circumstances, for example, of two young people doing something wrong who live next door to each other, where the parents of one give their consent and the parents of the other do not give their consent to this penalty. Will that not create all kinds of problems?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed, I agree with my right hon. and learned Friend. It is liable to put parents into great difficulties, the more so in that, if parents have to give their consent in court, there is an element of blackmail, because the parents will also know that if they do not give their consent their child is liable to a custodial sentence. The element of voluntary consent, therefore, will be virtually absent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may elaborate on the point raised by the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin), is it not also a fact that we are now moving away from the idea that a parent is simply the father? We have joint custody and joint guardianship between husband and wife, and a defect of the new clause is that it does not meet the current position. One could have a situation in which in the same household the joint guardians disagree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is certainly a possibility. If I may move on from the question of parental responsibility, there is also the unanswered question as to the responsibility of social workers or probation officers, who again may have a role given to them by the court or as a consequence of the court's decision in relation to the individual in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would ask the same question about them as I have asked about parents. Are they to report to the police the young person with whom they have some involvement in the course of their professional duties if that young person is known to them to be in breach of the curfew order? It would certainly put social workers and probation officers into a very difficult position in so far as their relationship with the young person is supposed to be one of mutual trust and confidence, and it would be seen to be a breach of that mutual trust if, knowing that the young person was in breach of the order, they were to report him to the police, which might lead to his going into custody.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Parris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are not social workers daily in the position of knowing that some of those within their care are in breach of the law and daily used to dealing with the problem of whether to report them to the police?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it may well be that in the day-to-day course of their work social workers and probation officers are faced with that difficulty. But I suggest that if this new clause were to become law they would be placed in an even greater difficulty than before. If a young person was simply not at home, say, after 6 o'clock in the evening, that would be a much more difficult dilemma for probation officers or social workers than if a young person known to them had actually committed a criminal offence. After all, the young person might simply be on his way home and might have not got there by the time the curfew hour was imposed, yet they would know this because they might have seen him walking along the street towards his home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are they to do? Are they to turn a blind eye to it, which is what I suggest would be the sensible thing for them to do, or should they turn up at the police station and say, "Johnny Jones," or whatever his name is, "is still out. You ought to know that he is in breach of the curfew order"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to intervene again, but hope that, by doing so, I may avoid taking the time of Committee to make a speech myself. Is not one of the difficulties about this whole question of enforcement —I am not putting it very high, but it should be taken into account—that it gives enormous opportunity to the ill-disposed busybody to be the person who makes the complaint?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>822</span>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed it is, because if other people in the neighbourhood happen to know that a young person is under a curfew order, what is there to prevent them from phoning the police station and saying, "So-and-so is not indoors; he is sliding down the slide on the playground on the estate,", or whatever it is. "Should he not be indoors?" Will the police have to spend much of their time pursuing these sort of allegations, which I suggest would leave a very nasty impression in the area where this sort of thing might occur?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn next to the question of the consent of the defendant. Again, I concede that it is desirable that the person on whom the order might be imposed should consent to this being the case, but that consent would be a somewhat less than voluntary consent in that if a young person knows that the alternative is custody, then of course that young person would consent to that order being imposed upon him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to another and different point. It is stated in the wording of the new clause and I think it is important, in fact vital, that this should be seen only as an alternative to a custodial sentence. My fear is that, despite that wording, the courts might well be tempted to see it as an additional form of punishment, but not necessarily as an alternative to custody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the question of enforcement. I know that curfews are sometimes imposed as a condition of bail, and I agree that we have not heard any evidence that, as a condition of bail, they do not work because they are not enforced, although I suspect that they are breached rather more frequently than the available evidence suggests. Probably a fair number of young people who have a curfew imposed upon them as a condition of bail, are in breach of that now and again. It is my understanding that, as a condition of bail, the curfew is normally applied about 10 o'clock at night, and not to the long hours suggested in this new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman a few moments ago was asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) about the relationship between the police and young people and whether they would be prejudiced as a consequence of this measure. I fear that they would be, and I fear that the hon. and learned Gentleman dismissed the possibility rather too easily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the police suspect that there are one or two young people in a youth club or on some premises who might be in breach of a curfew order, what is to stop them picking up the lot, taking all the kids to the police station and then checking which of them, if any, are subject to a curfew order. The danger is that this would give the police additional powers which they would be tempted to use, and which would in fact result in a rather greater process of hustling young people than is now the case. I would have thought that this would have very undesirable consequences indeed in terms of relationships between young people and the police, and is something that would have to be avoided by making it impossible for the police to behave in this way. If such a caveat is not included in the new clause, I fear that it will give the police rather more powers than they have at the moment to stop young people, to interrogate them, and indeed to have them back in the police station to check whether or not they are in breach of a curfew order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I set out to express mild sympathy for the idea and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0593">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>823</span>
strong reservations about the way in which it was to be applied. But the interruptions from hon. Members have probably put me into a position of stronger opposition to the proposal than I had intended at the outset. I have reservations because I fear that unless my reservations can be met something which intrinsically might not be a bad idea if used cautiously for young people only, would be rather an unpleasant measure if applied on the wide scale suggested in the new clause. I hope therefore that the hon. and learned Gentleman will think again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally I should like to put forward one other reservation which I have about the proposal. There is nothing in the new clause which suggests that the imposition of a curfew should be specifically related to the offence or to the offender's lifestyle. I feel, however, that there should be good reason for believing that the offence and the offender's lifestyle were such that a curfew order would have a salutary effect. For example, if the offender was prone to being out late in the evening and if the offences had been committed at that time, there would then, I submit, be a better case for a curfew order than if the imposition of the hours of curfew bore no relationship to what the offender had done and the way in which he lived.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have serious misgivings about the new clause, and I hope that the hon and learned Gentleman will feel able either to answer my comments or to withdraw the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to support the motion put forward by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Lyell) and to congratulate him both for bringing the new clause before the Committee and for the most able way in which he presented it. As a principle it is not new. It is a natural extension of clause 19 which gives power to the magistrates' court to dictate to the young offender certain terms whereby he has either to report to a certain person or to be in a certain place at the time of the court's direction. To extend that in a natural way to ordering the young offender to be at home during the periods suggested in the new clause would seem to me to be an admirable and logical extension of the existing law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to detain the Committee long, so I shall not go over the ground which has already been covered by my hon. and learned Friend, but I should like to deal with one or two of the points made by the hon. Member for Battersea, South (Mr. Dubs). In particular, I would follow him to a certain degree in questioning two of the details of the new clause as now drafted. In the first place, I certainly do not think that it is appropriate for those who are over 18. The adult offender—and such young people are considered to be adults in almost every other area of our national law— is not in any other way or at any other time bound to follow the direction of his parents, so I do not accept that it would be appropriate to put an offender who is over 18 back into a minority, so to speak, or to give to the parents a responsibility which is theirs in no other sphere of law. I feel inclined to agree with the hon. Gentleman in suggesting that the new clause should be limited to young people under 18, although I consider the age of 18, rather than the school-leaving age, to be the appropriate age to change the limitation of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>824</span>
measure for the reasons I have just expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point which the hon. Gentleman made, with which I heartily concur, relates to the difficulty which would arise within the family circumstances, which could give cause for concern were the curfew limitation to be imposed in the wrong circumstances. Something which I think should be taken into account is the position of parents who have a large family, and many of the young offenders in the category for which this penalty would be appropriate come from large families. It is difficult to envisage the circumstances in which the parents and the other children will relish— or should be asked to face—the prospect of themselves staying in the house for the Saturday and Sunday afternoons for which the curfew is imposed. I believe that this could give rise to serious difficulties in most families, particularly during the summer and at times it would be likely that they would wish to be away from home at weekends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This could be taken into account by the court at the time of the sentence but the difficulty, as I envisage it in practical terms, will be for the parents at the time of the sentence to be able to say which specific Saturday or Sunday they wish to be away and to get the court to leave that particular weekend out of the order. I should like to see an amended drafting whereby the parents could take the responsibility upon his or her own shoulders of having the child with them, not necessarily in the place of residence as an alternative to staying at home throughout the afternoon or evening period specified if the family were going away to stay somewhere. I believe that some such extension of the supervisory duties and powers of the parents would not be impossible to draft and would greatly add to the practicability of imposing such a sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My last point concerns the consent of the child. I think that this is important. There are two aspects here. There is the very young child, where consent is not particularly necessary. As my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Lyell) has already said, a 10 or 11-year-old should perfectly well come under the discipline of his or her parents without the consent of that child. But as the children get older it becomes more difficult to control them and in some cases, as I mentioned in my intervention, there are instances where the parents are out of control of their children, by their own admission, by the age of 12 and 13.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, I can envisage the possibility of the child saying "No, I am not prepared to submit to my parents' authority", and it would be wrong in those circumstances for the parents to be forced to take that responsibility, or even invited to take that responsibility, if other sentences can be found which are more appropriate to the circumstances. The consent of the child is important as the child grows older. That is particularly important should the new clause go through without the amendment which I seek, taking out the older group, because if an 18, 19 or 20-year-old is not prepared to stay at home, albeit that the parent is prepared to try to make him stay at home, the whole merit of this excellent new clause could be lost by being unworkable in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wholeheartedly support the principle of the curfew provisions, but I cannot go along with all the details of the new clause as drafted and I hope that amend
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0594">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>825</span>
ments will be made between now and the Bill being enacted to take into account some of the matters which I have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Jo Richardson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not support the new clause at all. The whole thing is absolutely fraught with problems. Even during the course of this debate very many problems—even to people who support the new clause—have evidenced themselves. We must be very careful indeed before we go down this road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was particularly taken with the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, South (Mr. Dubs) about the title. It certainly does smack of a military State or martial law, though that is a small point. The principal point is that on the whole it is a bad way of dealing with the matter, and I do not think that it would work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, South has already outlined a number of the problems which would devolve upon families which were made responsible for the young offender, and there are countless permutations and combinations of those kinds of problem. But I wonder whether the hon. and learned Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Lyell) has thought about the whole—I was going to say "army" but I do not want to go into that kind of terminology—group of people who live and work away from home. For example, in London of all places—this is the place where it happens most—I cannot see in this new clause any provision to cope with people who may have come from, say, Cambridge to live and work in London, who share flats—young fellows living together, young girls living together, or mixtures or whatever—and one of them gets into some kind of trouble. Very many of them are under 20. What happens then? Who will be responsible? Would the magistrates make that person's flatmates responsible for ensuring that that person was home by 6 or 7 o'clock? It is a ridiculous situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always possible with any law in this country to fantasise unreal situations. The point here is that the magistrates have the discretion, the right and the duty to look at the individual cases before them to see whether it is appropriate to implement this new clause. Clearly, in the circumstances which the hon. Lady has dreamt up, no magistrates' court would contemplate making any such order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not fantasy if it exists. I live in Hammersmith which has long roads full of bedsitters and flats. The hon. Gentleman is virtually saying that in that kind of situation the magistrates would use other options. That is fine, but it cuts out a whole group of people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silken</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely that is an argument against this proposal because of the discriminatory nature built into it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not replied to all the queries because I thought it better to deal briefly with them at the end. However, I should like to make the point to the hon. Lady that this new clause is one of a battery of weapons which can be used by courts with discrimination so as to fit the penalty to the offence
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>826</span>
and the offender. As my hon. Friend the Member for Nantwich (Sir N. Bonsor) said, one can think of many occasions where its use would be inappropriate. We are anxious to make it available for the many other occasions when it would be appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my right hon. and learned Friend says, we are getting into a position where there is tremendous discrimination between the types—it is all very well for the hon. Gentleman to tut-tut, but we ought to discuss these matters—and where a large group of people would be removed from one particular way of dealing with a particular offence. We will end up with a long list of different groups of people who could be dealt with in different ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about one-parent families? So far people have talked about the nuclear family of two parents and the problems that will arise there, but what about the one-parent family with a son or daughter in trouble? It will cause a tremendous amount of investigation on the part of the magistrates and the probation officers in order to dig into the various categories. Let us suppose that a one-pearent family has a job in the evening, or might occasionally have a job in the evening. Is that another category which will be excluded from the purview of the new clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bendall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Lady not agree that even if only a percentage of children are discouraged from moving into a life of crime and violence, this new clause will have contributed seriously to 'the problem with which we are faced today?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, but I dot think that it will contribute. In fact, it might make the situation considerably worse. I can think of certain families, let alone the categories that I have described. We keep talking about children, but we are actually talking about adults in many cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about a person who has offended, who works in London but lives outside London? Anyone going home or going out to a meeting via Waterloo station will see thousands of young people going home at night, getting home after 7 o'clock. What happens if they are the subject of a curfew order and the train breaks down or they miss the train?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should the parent ring the police and say, " My Janet, who was due home at 7.15, has not yet arrived. It is now 8 o'clock and I do not know where she is. She is the subject of a curfew order! " Endless possibilities arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, because I can help the hon. Lady on that straight away. The new clause specifically provides that one would not even be offending if one had reasonable excuse. Clearly, the train breaking down would be a reasonable excuse</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has misunderstood me. I am not suggesting that that would be the subject of any further penalty. I am asking what the parent is to do. The parent is waiting at home for Janet, or whoever, to arrive home for supper, more anxiously than normal because of the curfew order, and she does not arrive. Janet has an excuse, but what does Mum or Dad do? Does he or she say, "She has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0595">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>827</span>
obviously missed the train, so I shan't do anything?" Suppose she misses two trains or there is a breakdown? Does she report to the police? That is what the hon. and learned Gentleman has not yet made clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Lady aware, having regard to the previous intervention by the hon. and learned Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Lyell), that the matter of a reasonable excuse comes into question only in front of the magistrates. One has to haul the alleged delinquent in front of the magistrates before he can argue and try to show reasonable excuse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. In fact, everything that is now being said confirms my initial reaction, which was that I should vote against this curfew order. I can see nothing but problems, very great difficulties and additional work for those who have to produce a report on the offender or the various background circumstances which might attend upon a particular offender. This is nonsense and will not work at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> Lyons: I find the proposed new clause rather horrific. I apologise for not being present when the hon. and learned Gentleman outlined the arguments for it, but the objections seem so cogent and obvious that I cannot imagine that they were met by his opening remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A curfew is known normally in two circumstances— when anticipating a period of insurrection as in Poland or some country in Central America, or in South Africa where the courts make curfew orders confining men or women to their homes and forbidding them to be in the presence of more than two other persons. The idea of Britain joining Poland and South Africa with curfew orders I find absolutely horrifying and repellent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not going to shoot them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyons</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is said that the object is to prevent young people from engaging in a life of violence. The Lord Chief Justice last week made a speech in the other place in which he complained bitterly that a principal cause of current bad behaviour was the influence of violence on television. The purpose of the new clause is to ensure that young people are put in front of a television set from six o'clock every night without remission. We shall have a society of young people who will do nothing constructive under the curfew order. They will all be TV-gazers. That may be good for commercial TV advertisers, but I cannot think that it is good from any other point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It can be argued that the curfew can be made subject to the exemptions for a person on the night that he or she wants to go to a youth club. But in order to decide on what nights the curfew should apply, the court would have to state on what night there was a reasonable excuse for this young person to be allowed out. That will place a further burden on court time. One of the effects of this proposal will be to increase the burden on the courts, since it is difficult to imagine that many young persons will not break the curfew, and police officers and others will be hauling young people before the courts for breach, thus increasing the work of the courts at a time when we are told that the courts are under heavy strain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>828</span>
Further, what happens when a young person, who is believed to be subject to a curfew order, is stopped in the street? Is he simply returned to his home by the constable in order to come out again the moment the constable has left, or is he put in the police cells while inquiries are made? Will he be put into some kind of custody other than the custody of his parents, if indeed there are parents available at the time?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know of people in my own constituency who work night shifts and whose children are left alone throughout the night because—in the case of a single-parent family—the man or the woman works throughout the night. There would be little point in returning a youngster to that sort of home if caught out. Therefore, one imagines that some other arrangements would have to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am against any new clause, any new Act of Parliament, any new provision which brings the law into disrepute because it cannot properly be enforced. We must be very careful in this place to make laws which are enforceable and which are not widely ignored. Many youngsters will regard it as a point of honour to see how often they can break the curfew order. If they develop an attitude of mind that it is easy to break the law and to flout authority in that way, in my view that breeds a general attitude which does not augur well for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consent which is required by this new clause is meaningless. There is already a provision in law which says that a person cannot be put on probation without asking him or her whether he or she is willing to be put on probation. In the whole of my own judicial experience and of my time in the court, I have never seen any person refuse to be put on probation. If he refuses, the court has to move on to a rather more condign punishment. The person is so desperate that the probation is manna from heaven and, of course, there is consent.

Take an example from the new clause. The magistrates are thinking of making a curfew order. The parents do not think that they can enforce it because they know that they do not have control over their children, or it is a one-parent family, they are often away, on night shift, or something of that sort. The father might be a long-distance lorry driver away from home from time to time. He knows that if he refuses, his child will never forgive him when it suffers a custodial sentence. The child will never forgive him and will say, "If you had agreed, I would not have suffered this sentence." One is breeding such enormous resentment against the parents in that circumstance that the parent will be emotionally blackmailed by the youngster into saying, "Yes, I consent," even when that parent knows that he or she is not in control of that young person, because the contrary will be a lifetime of resentment from the son or daughter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course the child will consent because he will know that if he does not, something worse will befall him. Therefore, the consent here is a false consent. It is a consent which means nothing at all. Everyone will consent for reasons which do not necessarily have to do with a genuine consent or approval of the course of action.

These young people sometimes live in very confined homes, sometimes in homes that are overcrowded,

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>829</span>
sometimes in homes where the parents are fighting like cat and dog, which is why the child went out in the first place. To confine them to that kind of home night after night with a blanket curfew seems to me to be crazy and counterproductive. It will build up such resentment in that young person, if in the end he is forced by a strong parent to stay at home or if he is frightened of what might happen to him if he is caught out, that he is much more likely subsequently to be an enemy of society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It means using the parents as policemen. This a proposal for parents to police their children. We have heard of children informing on their parents and parents informing on their children in totalitarian States, but this is not just a question of informing; this is a question of policing. A woman may have several children and go out to work. She can scarcely cope, and yet the court is saying "You shall be the policeman on behalf of the State for this child." She may wish to be, but she may be very ineffective for reasons which are deep-seated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has spoken with fervour against the curfew provisions and I have followed with care what he has said. But why do the same arguments not apply to the condition and the power to impose the same condition in the case of a young person who is bailed? The courts have this power and they use it frequently. Is that wrong too?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyons</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The power of curfew in bail in my experience is very seldom used. It is uncommon. Usually there are reporting provisions rather than curfew provisions. What we have here is something entirely different. The purpose is different. If there were evidence that bail was being used as a general machine to keep people indoors after 6 o'clock throughout the night, I think there would be an outcry. I should be interested to hear whether the Minister has any statistics on this because it very seldom happens. In fact, I have worked in the courts for many years and I have never heard of such a provision being made by a court, that a person should be confined to his home from 6 pm. I cannot remember such an occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it be the case that the courts use the bail power sparingly, why should the hon. and learned Gentleman suppose that this power would be used without similar discrimination and not used only in a proper case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyons</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the new clause is to create a new type of sentence. It is like suspended sentences or partially suspended sentences. This is a new form of sentence to be used by the courts, as one Conservative Member openly said, as one of a battery of weapons. Bail is not meant to be an offence. Bail is meant to be a method of keeping people out of custody pending the hearing of the charge. The new clause relates to a punishment to be given after conviction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S.C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. and learned Gentleman read the view expressed by the National Association of Probation Officers? It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Curfews are now used as a condition of bail, although the responsibility for keeping it lies squarely with the defendant, not with a third party."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>830</span>
It said that its experience has not been encouraging and that—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Defendants are tempted to break their curfews for a wide variety of reasons unconnected with crime—working overtime, family celebrations, hospital visits",</p></blockquote>
and so on, and that—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Since the chances of detection are limited, repeated breaches are encouraged."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyons</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman for that intervention. I have not read that particular document, but it clearly contains much good sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me about community policing is that we will have the community policeman presumably making the arrests because he will know the youngsters in his area. There will be an undermining of the role of the community policeman, because one of his principal roles will be to keep his eyes open for youngsters in his area who are subject to curfew orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another reason I do not like the curfew order is that it is capable of extension. It introduces a new punishment into English law capable of extension to other groups and classes for all kinds of reasons. In a free society we should be extremely loath to allow the introduction of a principle which says that considerable numbers of individuals can be simply confined to their homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been enormous outrage internationally, particularly among international lawyers' groups—the International Commission of Jurists in Geneva, the English branch of which is called Justice—-about the South African practice of curfew orders. For us to impose this kind of punishment is a retrograde step. The courts will be increasingly clogged by charges of breach of this order. People will then be sent to prison who would not originally have been sent there had this curfew order not existed. It will be regarded as a sign of their unruliness and criminality that they have broken the curfew order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Barking (Miss Richardson) referred to the case of someone worried about a means of transport breaking down so that he arrived home late. Take a case where there is an unofficial strike—for example, the recent strike by London Transport—when people made great efforts to get to work and arrived home from work very late. It is all very well saying that a person who took a chance and arrived home at 8 o'clock as a result of a strike would always be able to give a reasonable excuse, but that begs a host of questions. For example, when the constable arrests or stops a young person who says that he has taken two or three hours to get home, the constable may not believe that person. He may say that that is just an excuse which should be explained to the magistrate. As a result, that young person is brought before the courts, an additional burden is placed on the police, the constable has to attend the court to give evidence about the conversation with the young person and the courts have to consider the matter. In the end, they may send someone to prison whom they otherwise would not have sent there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is likely to be a strike, the parents and the young person would get together and say "You'd better not go to work today. Stay at home because there's a chance you won't get back in time. Play it safe." A day's work would therefore be lost.

I have had a letter from the hon. Member for Croydon, North-West (Mr. Pitt), a member of this

Committee, who has written to me to say that he regrets he cannot attend this morning. He has set out a number of arguments, some of which I have used in my speech, objecting vehemently to this proposal. He wishes me to point out to the Committee his own intense objection to this curfew proposal. I hope that the proposers of it will ask leave to withdraw, because if they do not, and if this were to be carried, the sponsors will place something on the statute book which they will long regret. It will be a cause of great shame to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bendall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened intently to what has been said and I must in all honesty say that I am a little disappointed in what I have heard. First, I should like to congratulate my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Lyell) on this new clause because I strongly believe that what we are trying to achieve in the Bill is basically to keep young people from getting into further trouble, and to try to find ways in which we can assist the law to achieve that end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Comments have been made this morning about extenuating circumstances. We have talked about strikes, missing trains, and things like that, but I have never known the courts to be unreasonable where extenuating circumstances are concerned. Had we kept a percentage of young people away from trouble, this new clause would have contributed very much to the Bill, because keeping young people out of trouble has been very much the centre factor of the Bill, which we have been discussing for several weeks. It also adds to the fact that we have been trying to put some responsibility back where it belongs. When young people are in trouble in society the responsibility must be laid somewhere. If it is not laid with the courts or with society, it must be laid with the parent. I should have thought that to try to lay the responsibility with the parent in the first instance, to try to keep young people away from trouble, was the right outlook.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to detain the Committee long, other than once again to congratulate my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead on what I consider to be an imaginative new clause. I hope that this new clause will be accepted and taken on board in the Bill because I believe that it is our duty, as members of this Committee and of this House, at least to give fair wind to new ways of trying to resolve problems in society that are here today—problems that will not go away, but must be faced, with new methods. I congratulate my hon. and learned Friend for bringing forward an imaginative new clause. I wish it fair wind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to be extremely brief, not more than three minutes—provided I am not interrupted. I hope that the hon. and learned Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Lyell) will take seriously the very real problems which have been referred to, not only from the Opposition but by his hon. Friends. They seem to me to be of a very important nature and matters which I am sure he has thought about but which need to be thought about again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a new clause of this kind is at any time to be inserted in the Bill, one must be quite certain that it will be effective and will not be counter-productive but will realise its objective. I shall not repeat all or any of the problems which have been referred to. I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>832</span>
do not regard them as being the sum total. There are other problems as well, but I shall not deal with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to look for one brief moment at the basic principle behind the new clause. Let me assure the hon. and learned Gentleman that my view is that the greater the number of intermediate steps that one can introduce before one has to resort to sending someone into custody, the better pleased I am. The most valuable thing that Parliament can do is to produce a series of steps that defer the day when a court feels bound to take a course that is rarely effective in dealing with crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My difficulty with the concept of the clause is that I do not know whether it is intended to be a punishment or a protection of the young person. I listened to the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendall) who spoke in eloquent terms about the need to protect the young person by keeping him away from temptation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see great force in attempts to keep young people, who may get into trouble if they go out at night and consort with the wrong people, out of trouble. I am not sure that the best way of doing so is that suggested by the hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons)—putting them down in front of the television watching the morals of the participants of "Dallas", for example. None the less, there may be something to be said for compulsorily keeping young people who, when they go out on the streets late at night, are likely to get into the wrong company and into mischief, out of those conditions. But that will not be achieved by the clause, which limits the order to a maximum period of three months and 42 days within that three months. On that basis, surely it is a punishment rather than a protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Hemel Hempstead has fallen between two stools in the way that he has tried to give effect to an idea which, although it has much merit, could be implemented more effectively in some other way. I have in mind the use of probation and the making of some condition that would be appropriate to the circumstances and would last for a good deal longer than 42 days out of three months. I accept all the difficulties of enforcement that would arise in those circumstances, but something like that would be a better solution—if one wants to keep the young person liable to get into mischief off the streets— than the provision in the new clause which is a penalty or punishment and part of a system by which the court may give one of a series of punishments in relation to a particular offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is right, as my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, South (Mr. Dubs) suggested, that the order should be used only as an alternative to custody, one can rarely see a case where the consent would have any reality because it would almost always be given. That might well be so even if the alternative were a fine, because a parent would know that the presumption would be that the parent would have to pay the fine. I can well understand his giving his consent in that case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those points need consideration in the detailed working out of the principle. I find the principle itself subject to an irreconcilable dichotomy. Therefore, I come down against any such penalty as that provided by the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Warren Hawksley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(The Wrekin)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the purpose and reasoning for the new clause given by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Lyell). I think that we all agree that it is worth encouraging parents to be more involved, and that it is a good idea to involve the young offenders themselves in a responsible way. However, I believe that the debate we have had today, and the wording of the new clause, leave unanswered many questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was especially concerned to hear my hon. and learned Friend suggest that the police would not administer the proposed new clause and that they would not make visits to the homes. I believe that the question of enforcement lies at the back of whether the new clause should be accepted. If it cannot be shown that the new clause is workable, we are in great danger of bringing the law into disrepute, which would be very dangerous. We have talked about the involvement of youngsters in law and order, and we should try to ensure that they show respect for the laws of the land. If they are to do that it is essential that they know that the law will be upheld and that the law agencies will enforce it to the best of their ability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard that curfew has already been used as a condition of bail, but, as many Opposition Members pointed out, that is different from the current proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of bail—whether the offender is awaiting a hearing or awaiting sentence—there is a clear and evident deterrent effect. If the offender breaks the conditions of bail he is immediately likely to be held in custody pending the trial or sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Problems would be created by the new clause for such people as the homeless. Clearly it would not be practical to confine them to a home, since they have no home, so a certain number of people would be exempt from the provision. We have not been told whether it would supersede or run side by side with other supervisory or probation orders. Although we should encourage as many youngsters as possible to work with their parents within the home, there is a question mark against a new clause that insists that a youngster should stay in an environment that might not be desirable—for example, if the parents were constantly out. The court would not necessarily take that into consideration. If youngsters are to be confined to their home by a curfew order, it is desirable that the parents are there and that they should supervise the young person. If the parents went out for a night or something of that nature, it could create additional problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Definitions would have to be introduced to make the new clause watertight. What is the definition of a place of permanent residence? Does it include a garden? Would it be possible to go to the corner shop if the youngster felt hungry because his parents were out? Those are realistic problems that some might say were only details, but it is important that we should consider and clarify those points if we wish to introduce a new clause to assist in upholding law and order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be necessary for all the agencies of law and order to be party to the enforcement of the legislation. The proposal that the police should not visit the house to check on the offender concerns me. If the new clause is to be placed on the statute book, it is important that it is enforced to the best of the ability of the agencies of law and order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the police concern about enforcement of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>834</span>
the proposed measure. They ask whether they would be expected to enforce it. Assuming that that were to be the case, surely it would be necessary for them to have a photograph or something to identify the youngster for whom they are looking. There may be a house with a Jamaican family with eight or nine children. What will happen when the policeman knocks on the door and says that he has called to see whether Johnny is at home? Possibly he might be brought Arthur or Peter instead. I wonder whether he would have the knowledge, the advice or the expertise to idenitfy the youngster he is seeking. That creates problems even where youngsters have to report to police stations. Will the police have the right of entry to the house? That could be a great problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The police would need the power of arrest. The new clause does not give them that power. If the youngster is contravening the curfew order it is not good enough for him or her to go back at a future time to the court. The power of arrest should be there if the terms of the curfew order are broken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea and purpose behind the new clause are right. I hope that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead will withdraw the clause as it stands so that further consideration can be given to the proposal to ensure that it is enforceable and to give time to take out the anomalies. Unless that is done, I shall feel bound to oppose it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It appears from interventions from the Minister in other hon. Members' speeches that the Government are, if not attracted to the new clause, sympathetic to its objectives. I assume that we shall return to the debate on another occasion. I shall not, therefore, detain the Committee with a lengthy discussion about the merits of the new clause, but it is important that, if the Minister gives a commitment to consider the new clause and come back on Report— which I suspect he will—he takes into account certain points that have been made in the debate and which I wish to reiterate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not necessarily opposed to the new clause in principle, like my hon. Friend the Member for Batter-sea, South (Mr. Dubs) and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin). I am in favour of any measure that can be used as an alternative to custody and that will be an additional obstacle in the path of imposing custodial sentences. However, I am not sure that the new clause will achieve the objectives set out for it by the hon. and learned Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Lyell). I do not like the title " Curfew orders ", but I do not accept the analogies of the hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons) between what we might do here and what has happened in Nazi Germany, South Africa or totalitarian States. It is an irresponsible flight of fantasy to introduce such an argument. We are talking about a simple home restriction on juveniles. If we called it that, we might avoid the emotive terms that have been attached to it. Whether it is effective and sensible, and whether it will be a constructive additional weapon in the armoury of the courts are other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about three aspects. The first is enforceability—I cannot see how the new clause can be enforczd in practice. That, as the hon. and learned Gentleman well knows, is the opinion of BASW, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0599">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>835</span>
Association of County Councils, NACRO and, indeed, the Association of Directors of Social Services. I shall take this opportunity to put on record their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Hemel Hempstead said on 25 March in col. 806 that the Association of Directors of Social Services supported the new clause in principle. I have no doubt that he was relying on the letter to him of 24 March from Raymond Hill of the Association of Directors of Social Services. An inference could reasonably be drawn from that letter that the association was in favour of the new clause. However, I am assured by the author that the association is not in favour and he wishes it to be placed clearly on record that it does not support in principle the new clause. All the organisations working in that area point to serious difficulties in enforcing the new clause. Many hon. Members have pointed to some of the tactical difficulties that would be involved in such an enforcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I am concerned about the friction that may be caused. I notice the Minister and the hon. and learned Member for Hemel Hempstead looking at the letter. I saw them looking at it earlier. The penultimate paragraph begins:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, we do not disagree with the idea of a Curfew Order in itself".</p></blockquote>
I accept that that appears to suggest that the association is in favour of the principle. But earlier in the letter it refers to the problems of workability. It reiterates its support for the comments in the letter from BASW, and I am assured by the author of that letter that it must not be interpreted as support in principle. Certainly nowhere in the letter does the association say, "We support the new clause in principle". Do either of the hon. and learned Gentlemen wish to intervene? I do not think that it is an important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am especially concerned that the introduction of the new clause could cause friction between the parent and the child who is subject to a curfew order—especially those between the ages of 12 and 21.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Hemel Hempstead, like many of his hon. Friends, assume that the parents of juvenile offenders are like himself, and that all parents are of one particular stereotype, all able to enforce discipline and control, all intelligent, educated, adequate and with resources at their disposal. I am sure that he knows that that is not the case. That is certainly not the case for the vast majority of juvenile offenders, whose parents in the main—as has been indicated, for example, by the research carried out by Harriet Wilson which, I gather, is before the Committee —are shown to be largely inadequate and in need of support and help themselves. They cannot be used as an additional wedge to bring their recalcitrant juveniles into line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many cases the parents have failed themselves and in no way are able properly to exert control—which we all wish them to exert—over their children. The introduction of this new clause would not enable those parents to exert such control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bendall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that parents basically know the difference between right and wrong?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>836</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bonsor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Also on that point, does the hon. Gentleman accept that those of us who have practised in the juvenile courts for some years have many experiences of parents who are genuinely concerned and upset when they discover the conduct of their children, of which they had hitherto been wholly unaware? In those circumstances, is this not an entirely appropriate step?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, of course some parents—not all—are aware of right and wrong. Those parents who happen also to be criminals clearly are not aware of the difference between right and wrong. In reply to the hon. Member for Nantwich (Sir N. Bonsor)—yes, of course there are many parents—we all have them as constituents, not just as clients—who are not always aware of the criminal or delinquent activities of their children. But, once they are made aware of them, they deal with them effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about a different class of parent, who may or may not be aware of their children's behaviour, but who are incapable of exerting the parental responsibility. As with the provision for the imposition of fines on parents, the new clause will in no way contribute to the greater exercise of parental responsibility. I want that. I share the same objectives as the hon. and learned Member for Hemel Hempstead, but I do not believe that, with the kind of parent with whom we are dealing, that objective will be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Far more worrying is the impact the new clause will have on relations between the police and youngsters. It was easy for the hon. and learned Member for Hemel Hempstead to react to my earlier intervention in a flippant and glib fashion—which, perhaps, demonstrated his failure to think through and accept that this could be a difficult and sensitive area. He is asking the police to involve themselves in a way in which they will not be involved in any other area after the commission of an offence and the imposition of a sentence. He is saying that once a sentence has been imposed, the offender shall nevertheless be subject to surveillance, spying and control—whatever word one wishes to use—by the police. That will be carried out not by social workers or probation officers, but by the police. I am not aware of any other area where we actually give the police a continuing function in relation to offenders after a sentence has been imposed. What kind of surveillance, what kind of watching techniques will be involved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to give one example to the hon. Gentleman. It relates to motor cars. The police frequently pick up young people driving in circumstances in which they should not be driving. That happened with a car of mine. Some youngsters drove into Oxford in a car belonging to me. The police officer knew that it could not be their car and he picked them up at once. The fact that the police are using their eyes and ears as they patrol and take part in the community is only one of the sensible functions that they carry out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course that is so. We only wish that the police would use their eyes and ears a little more often so that they would have a far more effective clean-up rate than they have had during the past three years of Conservative Government, during which the rate has declined. But that is not the case. The hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0600">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>837</span>
and learned Gentleman cites the fact that the police recognised a certain car or a driver who should not have been driving it. That is not the same as giving the police a continuing responsibility for watching over persons who have been sentenced and, for enforcing sentence—a function which they do not have in any other area. The hon. and learned Gentleman may have misunderstood me, but in any event he could not provide an example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances there is the potential threat that the police may involve themselves in spot checks, especially where large groups of young people tend to congregate, whether it be at youth clubs, football matches or elsewhere. If we have an extensive use of the curfew order, it is reasonable to assume that police will use their powers of stop and search on a greater and more extensive scale in than they have done previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that were to happen, one of the consequences would be a further deterioration in relations between the police and youngsters, and not least between the police and black youngsters. These are already at a low ebb and are deteriorating, and I do not think that we should do anything in the House to contribute to a further worsening of those relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that basis alone, I do not see any substantial benefits or advantages in the new clause to outweigh the serious loss of credibility that would be occasioned by its unenforceability, the fact that it may exacerbate family relationships rather than help to deal with them and, finally, the fact that it may have as a serious consequence a worsening police-public relationship and a further diminution of confidence in the police. For those reasons, the Minister will have either to come up with arguments or proposals that will meet those three serious deficiencies or forget the new clause altogether.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I take a restricted view of the circumstances in which this sentence would be appropriate, but that in no way weakens my support for including the measure, or a similar measure, in the Bill. My support is enthusiastic. Opposition Members have been impressive in the lists of circumstances in which it would be inappropriate to impose such a sentence. But to wish to give the courts the option one has to be convinced of only two propositions—first, that there are some circumstances in which it would be an appropriate sentence and, secondly, that magistrates and the courts generally are capable of distinguishing between appropriate and inappropriate cases. I am convinced of both those propositions. This is only a first draft of the new clause. I think that most of my hon. Friends agree with that.

I listened to the hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons). In a mould-breaking contribution to criminological thought, he suggested that, because one could think of circumstances in which a punishment would be inappropriate, that was an argument against that punishment ever being available to the courts. That seems to be the level of opposition to the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My enthusiasm for the new clause is, perhaps, best defined in the terms of the hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin). He spoke of ill-disposed busy-bodies who might be disposed to report either to parents or to the police what ex-young offenders might be doing, where they might be going or when they might be out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>838</span>
I come from a rural consituency in which there it a fairly high preponderance of people whom the righs hon. and learned Gentleman would describe as ill-disposed busybodies—people who are prepared to gossip and tell young David's parents what young David is doing, where young David has been and, indeed also to tell the local bobby what young David has been doing. I must say that the presence in my constituency—and also in the leafier parts of Dulwich— of ill-disposed busybodies has a rather beneficial effect on respect for the law among youngsters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the arguments that I have heard against the new clause could have been equally applied, for instance, against the concept of open prisons. It is a sensible and imaginative idea. The circumstances in which it may be appropriate will be fairly few, but it will merit its inclusion in the list of punishments available to magistrates. I hope that the Minister will view the new clause sympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Shirley Summerskill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The speeches by Opposition Members have ranged from expressing strong reservations about the new clause to outright opposition to it. None of my hon. Friends have actually welcomed the new clause as something that must be included in the Bill. There has been a wide range of criticisms, and many of them have been echoed by the British Association of Social Workers, the National Association of Probation Officers, the Association of County Councils and the Association of Metropolitan Authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout the proceedings of this Committee, the Minister has always referred with great respect to the views of the judiciary. Often his final opinion of any amendment or new clause appears to have been determined by the views of the judiciary. He and the Committee should pay as much respect to the opinions of probtaion officers and social workers, who actually have to operate many of the provisions and who work day in, day out with the young offenders. The judiciary does not work day in, day out with young offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember a television programme when Mr. Justice Lawton was asked," Do you ever meet offenders? I mean, do you ever meet ordinary people, and how can you know actually what is going on in life? " He thought long and hard and said " I read the newspapers. " He thought again and said " I watch television and I meet magistrates, and some of them are workers ". I always remember that summing up of how he met ordinary people. Probation officers and social workers meet many more young offenders than do members of the judiciary in the ordinary course of their daily lives.

The British Association of Social Workers has expressed reservations about the new clause which, it has taken the trouble to distribute to every member of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the hon. Lady's point about Mr. Justice Lawton—and if he were here he would certainly speak up for himself—instead of being the son of a medical practitioner and a Member of Parliament of great distinction, he was educated at an ordinary State school—	<i>{Interruption.)</i>—Wait a minute—	<i>(Interruption!)</i> —He was the son of someone in the prison service—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot have interventions during interventions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Justice Lawton was the son of someone who worked his way through the prison service and ultimately became governor of Wandsworth prison. I know that the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) would agree that Mr. Justice Lawton had a broad and varied upbringing, and undoubtedly knows the ways of the world. The hon. Lady could not have picked a worse member of the judiciary to cite as living in an ivory tower.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware that Mr. Justice Lawton is the only judge on the Bench who did not attend a public school, and he never misses an opportunity to point that out. But that does not mean that for the past 30 years, since he was called to the Bar, he has not been living in an ivory tower—and certainly since he joined the judiciary. I am talking about the people he meets in 1982, not about those he met when at grammar school as the son of a prison governor. He admitted, when trying to show how he mixes with ordinary people, that newspapers and television provide two-thirds of his acquaintanceship with workers. I was simply throwing in that point. I do not want anyone to get excited about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British Association of Social Workers states that it is extremely concerned about the involvement of the police in surveillance following an offender's court appearance. It is a novel concept, which has been referred to by my hon. Friends. The association is concerned about the way in which the provisions of the new clause will be enforced and about the effectiveness and credibility of such a measure. The National Association of Probation Officers feels that the practical effects of the proposal would be counter-productive. When the hon. Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris) said that he supports the new clause because it would be appropriate in some circumstances, there was a general murmur of approval from Conservative Members, including the Minister. If it is appropriate in some circumstances, it will be all to the good and should be put on the statute book. But the probation officers say, in support of it being positively counter-productive—not merely useful or appropriate in some circumstances—
	<br><blockquote><p>"We do not believe these orders would provide an effective sentencing alternative to custody and that the incidence of breaches may actually increase the use of custody without any impact on the incidence of crime."</p></blockquote>
They are afraid not that it would not be appropriate but that it would be positively counter-productive. I hope that the Minister will comment on that important criticism of the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the Association of County Councils and the Association of Metropolitan Authorities do not believe that curfew orders can be enforced. They say quite emphatically that they do not believe that the enforceability is a practical proposition. The argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, South (Mr. Dubs) about age is important, and has been echoed by several of my hon. Friends. Even if we accept the new clause it should be confined to school-age children. Once one gets into the realm of adults or married people there will be more problems in its enforcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>840</span>
Other ways to deal with the problem are already included in the Bill. There is no point in inserting a further alternative unless we are absolutely certain that it is workable, enforceable and effective. That criticism has been levelled against it by my hon. Friends and also by important organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a long debate about an important new clause. I congatulate my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Lyell) for having drafted it with great care and for having put before us an imaginative addition to the range of non-custodial options available to the courts when dealing with juvenile offenders. The length and quality of the debate, both today and at our previous sitting, have been an apt commentary on the importance of the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not an open and shut case. It never is when discussing the means by which the courts and society in general may deal with crime, especially crime committed by young offenders. A great deal has been said in favour of the principle of the new clause. I have listened with equal care to what has been said by Government and Opposition Members. I noted that the hon. Member for Battersea, South (Mr. Dubs) began by declaring himself not wholly against it and ended by saying that it was not, in principal, a bad idea if it was used cautiously for young people. The hon. Gentleman has had a long association with young people, and especially with problems of this nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) was also not against the principle. His point was mainly that the clause, as drafted, represented a punishment rather than a means of providing protection, and that if it was a punishment that could be done in a better way by other means. He favoured using confinement at home more in the context of a probation order or in other ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not detect from the speeches of Opposition Members an out-and-out rejection of the principle. There are matters that the Government will certainly want to take account when considering what has been said in this debate. There has been recognition by many members of the Committee of the need to help parents exert control over difficult offenders, where that is something which, when the facts are known is a practical objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have great sympathy with the intention of the new clause. As the Committee knows, the Government are deeply concerned at the extent of juvenile crime. They want to lend emphasis wherever possible to the responsibility of parents for their children. It is from parents, in the first instance, that children should learn not only that crime is wrong but that it will not be tolerated. The Bill already enables courts to bring home that responsibility to parents more readily by making them pay the fines or the compensation orders imposed on their children, and by increasing the sum to £500 by which they can be made to stand surety for their children's good behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend's new clause proposes, in an imaginative way, a further means of emphasising parental responsibility in a proper case. It is important to point out that, as drafted, it does not impose upon parents a liability to ensure compliance with the terms of the curfew order. It is designed primarily to enable
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0602">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>841</span>
courts to require that a young offender, for a relatively short time, shall be confined to his home between the hours set out in the new clause. An incidental effect is that it will assist parents to exercise influence over their children which they cannot do when their children are persistently out. That will be a valuable by-product in appropriate cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris) that one must ask whether magistrates can be trusted to use that power in a discriminating manner. That theme has run through our debates during past weeks. I have made it clear that the strength of the magistrates' system, proved over decades and centuries, is that magistrates are to be trusted with the discretions and jurisdictions that Parliament confers upon them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be odd if that were not the case, because magistrates are drawn from an ordinary cross-section of the community. Great care is taken to ensure that there is no political bias and that they represent the communities from which they are drawn, in which they live and which they serve. Those tribunals deal with 97 per cent, of all criminal cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we are a reasonable people and our system of criminal justice bears favourable comparison with most others in the world, if we confer a jurisdiction or discretion upon magistrates that will be exercised only in cases where the facts and the background are known, we should not assume that there will be many cases in which that power will be exercised unreasonably or without common sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, West that there are two questions to be answered. First, is the proposed power useful in certain circumstances? Secondly, can courts be trusted to discern those circumstances and not to apply the proposed power in others?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the new clause, as drafted, is probably in need of amendment in relation to consent, I have noted the point made by both opposition and Conservative Members that without consent certain difficulties may negative the virtue of the new clause. But my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead said that he had reached the conclusion that consent should be asked for from the juvenile offender to whom the power was to be applied. My hon. and learned Friend will deal with the letter from the Association of Directors of Social Services, but I understand that the association regard as an important improvement to the new clause a provision that the power should be applied only with the consent of the young offender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to look with care at how the proposal will shape if that change in the provisions of the clause were to be inserted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other matters have been raised during the debate which have indicated what I had already concluded, that a certain amount of work still has to be done to find a realistic way of giving effect to an order of this kind. The practical problems relate largely to enforcement. It is, of course, true that such a power already exists as a condition of bail. But much time has been spent considering the question whether there should be a power for the police to call at a house to ensure that the young offender is there. That would not be either
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>842</span>
necessary or desirable. I note the views of my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Mr. Hawksley), but it would not be desirable to confer that special power on the police to enforce such an order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point that laws should not be so unenforceable as to bring the law as a whole into disrepute. But it is not necessary for the police to check at any hour of the day whether a young offender is breaking an order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. and learned Friend agree that the police must, none the less, play a major role in the enforcement of the new clause if it is placed on the statute book—not least in amusement arcades where they may have a trawl to see if any such people were there illegally?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a different matter. The object of the power is to enable the courts to prevent a young offender, for a short period, from going to a place where he or she has habitually made a nuisance of himself or herself. If the young offender is found to be in breach of the order, there must be powers to deal with that. That is the whole purpose of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A certain amount of interest is to be found in the precedent of bail. Frequently the courts, when they have placed someone on bail, make a requirement that he shall live at a certain place. There is also power—and it is sometimes used—to require that he shall be at that place of residence within certain hours of the day or night. I have not heard it suggested that the fact that those conditions are not readily enforceable in some way diminishes their value. If those conditions are appropriate in the case of someone on bail, we should ask ourselves whether they would not also be appropriate in the circumstances dealt with in the new clause. It makes no difference in principle that the person on bail has yet to be tried and either acquitted or convicted, whereas the person who will be the subject of the new clause will have been tried and will be the subject of this sentence. That makes no real difference in principle, and such difference as there may be will be much diminished because he will have been asked for his consent—that is, if the new clause is amended as my hon. and learned Friend has suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disappointed that the hon. Member for Batter-sea, South (Mr. Dubs) produced a gentle but prolonged drizzle from a rather great height. He concentrated exclusively on various circumstances in which its use would not be appropriate. We must return to the question whether we are prepared to trust magistrates to look at the background and decide whether the order would be appropriate. Of course, there would be cases in which because of the home and family background, such an order would make the situation worse rather than better. But if I can see that, why should magistrates be incapable of seeing it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister has just said, also what he said in previous passages of his speech, indicates that if an order were to be made it would be vital for the court to have very full information about the background of the offender. I recall that when the Opposition sought to make it obligatory for that background to be provided, the Minister said the Government would not agree to that because it would mean remanding people in custody or delaying matters for an unacceptably long time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0603">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>843</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that a great deal should be known about the background of offenders. The courts do not need to have those matters spelt out in the statute, and we have been over that ground before. I agree with the right hon. and learned Member that in the generality of cases it would be unwise to make an order without knowing a great deal about the background of the offender. This is not the only instance where it is important that the courts should know about the background.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. and learned Gentleman suggesting that a social inquiry report should be obtained and, if so, that the offender should be remanded in custody while that happens?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that that is not what I said. If the hon. Gentleman was really interested in knowing what I was about to say, he would not interrupt me and I could say it rather more quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said that it is important that the courts should have available as many non-custodial options as possible before they feel obliged to send a young offender to prison. The new clause is well worth further thought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman referred to the proposed power as non-custodial, which it is. Will he comment on the fear of the National Association of Probation Officers which has suggested that it would be counter-productive and could increase the numbers in custody? Is that fear unjustified, or could it be, to use his own words, a gamble?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not being in the business of making instant decisions, either pro or con, I want to consider all the representations that have been made, and that will no doubt be made in succeeding weeks, about the proposal. Because enforcement is a matter of importance, we want to hear what the police have to say about it. We want to consider what has been said by the National Association of Probation Officers, the British Association of Social Workers and other bodies. I do not for a moment say that the fears expressed by responsible bodies are not justified. What matters is whether they should be considered to be decisive. Therefore, we wish to consider these matters. Problems of proving identity connected with enforcement in the street raise other obvious difficulties and we wish to consider those. In any event, we believe that consent is desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following this full and valuable debate, and in the light of what I have said about the Government's approach—which is one of warm sympathy with the intention of the new clause—if my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead feels able to withdraw the new clause, that might be the most constructive and helpful way to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be fairly brief, but I want to do justice to the points made in the debate. I am grateful to my hon. Friends and also to Opposition Members for the trouble they have taken to consider the new clause and for the points that they have put forward. Because one does not agree that a point against means that the clause should not be adopted does not mean that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>844</span>
we should dismiss the point. I could mention a large number of penalties already on the statute book and put forward arguments for and against their existence. In each case we must remind ourselves that the court has a discretion about which penalty to choose, and to which offender to apply it. It is important that we remind ourselves of that—as my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris) pointed out in his helpful speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that the courts take a great deal of trouble in selecting the appropriate penalty for an offender goes far to answer the points made by the hon. Member for Barking (Miss Richardson) and the hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons)— who kindly said that he cannot be with us for the remainder of the debate, but on whose contribution I wish briefly to touch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Barking would find it interesting, if she had the time, to attend one of the Inner London courts, especially one of the juvenile courts. No doubt she has done so. I am sure she will agree that immense trouble is taken by the justices to find out a great deal about the young offenders and their circumstances before deciding what penalty to choose, if any penalty at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Battersea, South (Mr. Dubs) knows, because he has told me so, that chairmen of juvenile courts in his area are anxious to have the clause precisely because they, from the knowledge of the young offenders who come before them, know that they have had a number of cases in which such a penalty or order would be appropriate. That answers the general comment that there are cases where the order would not be appropriate. That is not a reason for removing it from the court's overall armoury or—if one likes a less militaristic term—variety of options.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that it was the chairman of the juvenile court in my area. I had a lengthy discussion with a member of a juvenile court which is not in my area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And he was a Tory!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As it was a woman, I do not think that the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) knows what he is talking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same point has been made by a number of probation officers. The National Association of Probation Officers has expressed strong reservations in the papers that it has sent to us. While I have read those most carefully, it may be of interest to the Committee to know that the chief probation officer of my own county regards this as a very beneficial order—provided that it is used in proper cases—to lend support to the parent, and also as equating closely to the sort of restraint that a sensible parent might well impose in any event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also received support in a letter from a senior probation officer with long experience working in Inner London. He writes that, when discussing it with his colleagues;
	<br><blockquote><p>"initial reactions were against such an idea, some thought that it might be seen as an undue interference with the liberty of the subject etc., but on reflection it was accepted that wisely used it would be a useful, lawful and cheap punishment in the Court's armoury."</p></blockquote>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>845</span>
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to a point that has been made by a number of Opposition Members, and with which I agree—namely, that one does wish to have a variety of choices as alternatives to custodial sentences. In the early stages of an offender's life—and one hopes that it will stop in the early stages—the opportunity for nvolving parents cannot be overstressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received a constructive letter last week from Professor Tutt of the Department of Social Administration of the University of Lancaster, also supporting the new clause. I have mentioned him before, and I mention him again because I know that he is widely respected by the Committee and that he has a great deal of experience of intermediate treatment, which is another of the options open to the court, and which I hope wil become increasingly open to the courts. He can see this power as being beneficial within that framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot quote his complete letter, and I do not wish to suggest that he does not have some reservations about the new clause. He has written to me most helpfully with reservations about enforcement and the relationship of the order to the offence. But he makes the point that the comments are intended as positive criticism. He states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As you know our concern is to develop alternatives to the ever increasing use of custody for young offenders. The Curfew Order seems an excellent idea in that it could offer a high level of control of the young offenders time, be seen by the public to satisfy demands for punishment and deprivation of liberty, and yet not disrupt positive aspects of the young person's life, i.e. school and work, nor be expensive to implement."</p></blockquote>
Those are sensible reasons for supporting the new clause,and I was grateful to receive support from somebody with a great deal of practical as well as academic knowledge of this subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear what the hon. Member for Ormskirk said about the actual intention behind the letter which we received from the Association of Directors of Social Services. He is quite right that that is what I took to be support. Nevertheless, I remind the Committee that the association writes, after one or two queries about the way in which it might work and some comments:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, we do not disagree with the idea of a Curfew Order in itself. Indeed the principles of both the American "trucking system" and the success of the long custodial Close Support Unit are based part on the principle of the curfew."</p></blockquote>
He then states, which may be helpful to the Minister in the intervening weeks between now and Report, that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Probably the ingredient missing from your new clause is the consent of the child."</p></blockquote>
I readily take that point. Indeed, I know that the association will not mind my saying it, but I removed it from the new clause on the advice of the British Association of Social Workers. I see the hon. Member for Ormskirk shaking his head. I thought that I had removed it on the advice of the British Association of Social Workers. If the association would like it included, I should be happy to do so. I think that it would be sensible if it did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter from the Association of Directors of Social Services states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Probably the ingredient missing from your new clause is the consent of the child. The Curfew Order as you propose does not recognise his or her consent."</p></blockquote>
I should be glad to do so. The association suggests that that would be a sensible change—it calls it the minimum change required to make the curfew order workable. I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>846</span>
wholly agree with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that the new clause has its origins in the Magistrates' Association, which gave careful thought to the question of enforcement. I agree that the role of the police needs to be considered carefully. I agree with the points made by hon. Members in this regard. It would not be necessary for the police to go to the houses of young offenders to check up on them. I recognise the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Mr. Hawksley). It is a point on which one must exercise judgment. That is the way that I would recommend that judgment was exercised in this case. It is probably unnecessary for the police to have the right of immediate arrest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat what I think has great force, that if a young person re-offends and breaches a curfew order he is likely to go back to his old haunts and habits and, therefore, to come once again to the notice of the police.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. and learned Gentleman prepared to say that he would regard it as unnecessary for the police to embark upon what his hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Mr. Hawksley) called a trawl, or massive indiscrimate stops and searches in order to find young persons who potentially may be breaking a curfew?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, for bringing me to that point, because I want to say a word about the community, the responsibility of parents and community policing. It is important not to take a hostile attitude towards the police and not to think that when they are in the community they should not pick up those whom they know to be offenders or, in the case of the new clause, know to be in breach of a curfew order. The whole object of community policing is that the police should become once again part of the community, which contains responsible and sensible people—mistakenly and misguidedly categorised by some Opposition Members as busybodies—whose overall concern for the maintenance of law and order and the good of young offenders sometimes rightly causes them to put a word in the correct ear, whether it be the ear of the parent or the ear of the police. That is what community policing is all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While one recognises that there may have been times when the police and other organisations have become remote from the community, it is that which we seek to correct. Provided that whoever seeks to enforce it, whether it be the parent or—I am not thinking of a curfew clause here—a probation officer with a supervision order, or a police officer is part of the community and closely concerned with the individual, we shall get the kind of positive community policing which I know we all seek.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has referred on a number of occasions to community policing and sought to suggest that this new clause would work better in that context. I do not wish to divert the Committee into a discussion about the precise meaning of community policing, but is he aware that the generally accepted view is that community policing is not practised in London and most of our big cities and that, until the day it is practised, this clause will not work in the way he suggests?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I lived in inner London on the fringe of Brixton for 10 years. I have considerable experience of the way that policing was carried out there. I know that there is a view, supported to some extent by the Scarman report, that the methods of policing became slightly more remote from the community than they were 10 years ago. I know that there is a move, which all members of the Committee would support, to assist the police in getting back into the community and giving them the numbers, equipment and authority to do so. They should not be seen in any way as hostile to the community. All the points that were made in our debate last week by the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) about getting the bobby back on the beat—with which we wholly agree, although they came slightly ill from him as his party had removed the resources—are exactly to be related with the kind of community policing which we all seek

to achieve. We seek at the same time to find appropriate penalties and clauses to put in the Bill which will match in with it.

I am satisfied that this clause will match very well with the general framework that we all seek to set up. For that reason I am grateful to hear what the Minister has been able to say about the new clause. I accept that it is not perfect in its present drafting. I am very glad to hear that if it comes forward again on Report, in whoever's name, it is likely to be given a sympathetic hearing and, I hope, a welcome. In those circumstances I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
