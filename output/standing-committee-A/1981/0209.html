</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Thursday my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) chided the Minister for having announced that there would be an increase in the prison building programme but that the result would not be an increase in the total number of places. I and many of my hon. Friends do not want an increase in the total number of prison places. We are at one with the Minister in that particular objective and are in slight disagreement with my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we want is certainly an increase in prison building to replace the outdated and obsolescent conditions in many of our urban prisons, but we do not want to see an overall increase in places. We want to see a reduction in the prison population. These amendments, though not designed specifically to achieve that, will certainly—if they are accepted and implemented—lead to a reduction in the numbers of those sent to prison. The amendments stipulate that a court should impose a custodial sentence on a young offender only if he has shown himself unable or unwilling to respond to non-custodial penalties, or if a custodial sentence is necessary for the protection of the public. I move these amendments on behalf of the parliamentary penal affairs group, whose recommendations appear in its report "Young Offenders: A Strategy for the Future", published in July 1981, which these amendments closely follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is now general agreement among all those working with young offenders that there must be a major shift of emphasis and resources away from treating them in custodial conditions towards more emphasis upon treatment and care in the community.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
Indeed, the Advisory Council on the Penal System's major report, entitled "Young Adult Offenders", published in 1974, called for a major change from custody for those aged 17 to 20 to supervision within the community. Following that, the report of the Expenditure Committee, entitled "Children and Young Persons Act 1969", published in 1975, also called for a major shift of emphasis and resources away from custodial and punitive techniques towards intermediate treatment, supervision and nonresidential care in the community. Indeed, the whole weight of research evidence, both from this country and from abroad, from within the Home Office and from outside, suggests very strongly that we are likely to be far more successful in dealing with the real—sometimes impractical problems—of young people if we deal with them in the community. We are more likely to reach our objective of ensuring that they are law-abiding and constructive members of the community, not likely to commit further offences, if again we deal with them not in institutions but try to solve their problems where they have their origin, where eventually they have to be resolved, in the community in which they live. As the Advisory Council on the Penal System's report on "Young Adult Offenders" said in reviewing all the evidence, both from this country and abroad, the time spent in custody whether it was longer or shorter, did not produce any significantly different results in terms of re-conviction rates for the offender. Indeed, it said that the length of prison sentences or custodial sentences was very largely irrelevenat in terms of the effect upon the behaviour of the young person, once released.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since that report was published in 1974, reconviction rates have worsened quite significantly. In the last five years, for example, the proportion of young adults leaving prison who have committed further offences within two years of leaving has risen from 64 per cent, to 68 per cent. Sixty-eight per cent, of young adults sentenced to a term of imprisonment now commit further offences soon after their release. The proportion of those sentenced to borstal training committing further offences has risen in the last five years from 63 per cent, to 69 per cent., but most striking and most alarming of all, is the increase in the numbers of boys sent to detention centres, those who are now being subjected to the short, sharp shock and the drill parades and inspections. In the last five years the recidivist rate of those boys sentenced to detention centre has gone up from 54 per cent, to 68 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Advisory Council on the Penal System was telling us in 1974, what the Expenditure Committee was reiterating and reaffirming in 1975, seems to have been borne out by the evidence we have subsequently of the reconviction rates of those juveniles and young people sentenced to some form of custodial treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures for juveniles which were quoted and used quite considerably last week are even worse. Seventy-six per cent, of the under-17s leaving detention centres commit offences again within two years of release. That says very little for the efficacy of the present methods of dealing with young offenders. The whole point and purpose of the short, sharp shock is to point out to them, supposedly, the error of their ways and to put them on to a more con-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0158">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
structive and useful path. Yet on the evidence of the sole criterion of whether or not they are reformed or rehabilitated, whether or not upon leaving they commit further offences, those institutions have clearly been demonstrated to have failed to an amazing and alarming extent. That should cause everyone to want to review in great detail, and with great speed, what has gone wrong with our penal system that puts so many young people into institutions for such relatively long periods of time and seemingly to so little effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Eighty-three per cent, of those leaving borstal are reconvicted within two years. These horrible, horrendous—some would say brutal and dehumanising— institutions seem to hold such little fear for those who are incarcerated in them that they are re-offending again within a short time of leaving the institutions. That perhaps ought to suggest that we are not really dealing with the problems of these juveniles and young people in the most appropriate and efficient manner. To some extent it must surely raise at least a question mark that we are not doing the right thing if we are trying to achieve the objective that we all allegedly share, that we are not using the most appropriate methods and that perhaps other means would be more efficient, appropriate and successful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reflecting on that description, in particular of borstal institutions, as horrendous, horrible and dehumanising institutions, I wonder whether I follow the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's argument. I wonder whether he might not find space in the course of his remarks to pay tribute at least to the staff of the borstal institutions who try their very hardest, often with extremely unpromising material, to create a constructive and worthwhile regime. I do not quarrel with the statistics that he has given, but I think it would be unfair to dedicated staff if he were to leave his description of the borstal institutions, for example, with that catalogue of rather extreme adjectives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course. I am surprised that the Minister should wish to suggest or imply that I had any other motive in mind in making that suggestion. I have probably done and said more than any other hon. Member in this Committee to draw attention to the terrible conditions in which prison staff have to work. If those hon. Members who laugh can show a better record than mine, they should stand up and say so, but I shall not take that kind of chiding from the Minister. He knows it was unnecessary and that I was not intending to cast a slur, in any way, on either the prison officers or those who work in the borstal and detention centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From having close contact with them individually and with their professional organisations, I am well aware of the ardous and unglamourous nature of their work which I certainly would not want to do. I have nothing but esteem for the way in which they they carry out their particular functions. Nevertheless, that does not preclude us from describing some of our penal institutions—particularly borstals—as horrendous and dehumanising institutions. They are. That may have nothing to do with the propensity of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
staff. It has a lot to do, inevitably, with the intrinsic character of the institution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Dulwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend, with whose sentiments I agree, agree with me that the very fact that the staff of these institutions are as dedicated as they are, the fact that so many of them want to achieve what my hon. Friend is suggesting, goes into even starker relief with the figures that he has given and the fact that those methods have failed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course. As my right hon. and learned Friend knows, it is the staff of these institutions and their professional associations who make the representations to myself in my capacity as chairman of the parly penal affairs group and to my other hon. Friends present here today, precisely along the lines of wanting both a change in regimes and a reduction in the numbers sent to those institutions. However, I have been slightly diverted from the main thrust of my remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the evidence shows that the institutionalising or the incarcerating or juveniles and young offenders has not resulted in any reduction in those we are sending amongst those particular groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Advisory Council on the Penal System concluded in 1974 that, in order to achieve change, we need to shift the emphasis to dealing with children, and young offenders, in the community, rather than withdrawing them from the community. Supervision within their normal, natural and proper social context was more appropriate and more likely to be more successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, the evidence we have already of some of the non-custodial alternatives seems to suggest that they are more likely to be successful in achieving a lower rate of recidivism than the custodial alternatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week the hon. Member for Nantwich (Sir N. Bonsor) made the relevant point that we cannot really draw a comparison between the recidivist rates of penal institutions and those of non-custodial alternatives, such as intermediate treatment, because they deal with different types of individuals. It is to be expected that community service orders and intermediate treatment would have a better rate of recidivism because they are dealing with the less delinquent young people—and that is perfectly correct. They would not be sentenced to community service or intermediate treatment orders if they were less delinquent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Already several intermediate treatment schemes have deliberately taken what is referred to as the heavy end of juvenile and young offenders. They have taken those would would otherwise have been given a custodial sentence, and because they are being properly monitored, the recidivist rate is 25 per cent, to 35 per cent. That is not a particularly successful figure nor something about which to be overproud, but it is when set against the 83 per cent, of borstals or the 76 per cent, of those leaving detention centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that no straight comparison can be made. Nevertheless, the discrepancy between the success so far of intermediate treatment schemes and the clear, acknowledged and demonstrable failure of borstals and detention centres is impressive and ought, at least, to make us think about the strategy that we have so far adopted.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the fact that all informed opinion seems to be on the side of non custodial measures, and that all the evidence shows that that is likely to be far more successful than incarceration in institutions, the trend in the last decade has been precisely the opposite. It is a myth to suggest that following the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 fewer juveniles have been put in institutions. It is a myth to suggest that they have been taken over by social workers. In fact, precisely the opposite has happened. There has been a sharp increase in the numbers and proportions of juveniles sent to detention centres and borstals. The Government in their White Paper " Young Offenders,'" in paragraph 39, referred to this disturbing trend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give some figures. The number of juveniles sentenced to borstals and detention centres was 3,000 in 1970, but rose to 7,500 in 1980. In the same decade, the number of juveniles given supervision orders in 1980 was 4,000 fewer than those given probation orders in 1970. That clearly shows that in that decade we have been less ready to supervise young offenders in the community, less ready to deal with them by more imaginative and potentially successful schemes in society, and far more ready to lock them up and send them away, out of sight and mind, into institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge that there has been an increase in juvenile crime during that period, but it is relevant to point out that the rise in the number sentenced to penal institutions has increased faster than the rise in the number of juveniles coming before the courts in that period. The Government may want figures. I have no doubt that the hon. and learned Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve) will want to challenge them, given the slightly irrelevant figures that he quoted last week that made the argument more for prevention than for an increase in sentencing sentences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although juvenile crime has increased, it has increased at a slower rate than those sentenced to penal institutions, and a larger number of juveniles convicted of indictable offences are now sentenced to custodial sentences than in 1970. The number has doubled. It has increased from 6 per cent, of those convicted of indictable offences sentenced to custodial care in 1970 to 12 per cent, in 1980. In the same period, there was a drop in supervision orders from 22 per cent, to 16 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us look at young adults. We do not find the same dramatic increase in the use of custody for young adults, but it is also fair to point out that there has been little progress towards dealing with young adults in the community as called for by the Advisory Council on the Penal System in 1974. In all the years that have elapsed since that major and important report was published, we have done little in relation to young adults to implement its sentiments and arguments. We have done quite the reverse in relation to juveniles. Far more young adults now receive immediate prison sentences and there has been a decline in the use of probation orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that it is necessary to lock up certain juveniles and young offenders. Of course, the public must be protected from those who are more violent and aggressive and there will always be a continuing need for some kind of custodial facility to cater for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
the small minority of violent and dangerous juvenile and young offenders. I accept that, but I do not in any way allow it to detract from my main point which is demonstrated overwhelmingly by the evidence. In this country we have an enormous propensity for the over-use of custody, not just for juveniles or young people, but for adults and children too, in all spheres not only in the penal system but also in respect of mental health and mental illness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973 laid down that an offender under 21 cannot have a prison sentence passed upon him unless other methods can be shown not to be appropriate. If he is given a prison sentence, the court must state why it has decided on that particular option. This stipulation applies only to those under 21 who are to be subjected to a sentence of imprisonment. Clause 1 now extends that same principle to all custodial sentences for young people. This in itself is to be welcomed and applauded. However, like many other things in the Bill, the Government have gone only part of the way. For some reason or other they have stopped short of the proper full-blooded implementation of a proposal that would have the effect that not only I and the all-party penal affairs group but the Government want as well. A recent editorial in the 	<i>Criminal Law Review</i> said on page 753:
	<br><q><p>"The Government proposes to use a formula which even its own advisers recoginse to be ineffectual."</p></q>
The reference was to a comment by Mr. Michael Moriarty of the Home Office on the formula in the Bill, which is in the Powers of the Criminal Courts Act 1973. In evidence to the Expenditure Committee on 19 June 1978 he said:
	<br><q><p>"There is not very much evidence that it has greatly affected actual sentencing practice."</p></q>
That view of the Home Office official responsible for these measures, before a Select Committee of this House has also been supported by an examination of the whole question of giving reasons in magistrates' courts carried out by Brian Harris, who is the president if the Justices' Clerks' Society. His examination appeared recently in the journal 	<i>Justice of the Peace.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment is an attempt to provide a formula that will affect the actual sentencing practice. Indeed, Mr. Dean, it will come as no surpirse to you or to the Minister that the words of the amendment reflect almost exactly the words used in paragraph 3 of the Government's White Paper "Young Offenders". This contains what I believe to be an important statement of the Government's view of circumstances in which custodial sentences might most appropriately be imposed on young offenders. It says:
	<br><q><p>"The Government is doing as much as possible to encourage the development of non-custodial facilities so that the court may continue to have a range of alternatives sufficient to ensure that an offender is given a custodial or residential sentence only when he is a real danger to society or has shown himself unwilling or unable to respond to non-custodial penalties, or, in the case of a juvenile, is in need of care and control that he is unlikely to receive at home."</p></q>
The last of those three criteria is relevant to care orders rather than to custodial sentences, so it does not feature in this amendment. With that qualification, the amendment is a faithful reflection of the Government's own stated view of the circumstances in which custodial sentences should be imposed on young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0160">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
All too often, unfortunately, sentencing practice at present does not correspond either with the sentiments expressed in the White Paper, laid down in the amendment or, indeed, with what is enjoined by the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973. Again a myth seems to have got around that courts pass a custodial sentence only as a last resort, whereas if one examines the evidence they seem all too ready to use a custodial sentence inappropriately when other non-custodial measures might have been more sensible and beneficial, both to the offender and to the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, a Home Office study of young persons received into borstal between 1 July and 31 December 1977 showed that 35 per cent, of them had never previously received a supervision order or a probation order and that 35 per cent, of them went straight to borstal without there being any previous attempt to deal with them effectively in the community. Again, it was true of 78 per cent, of a sample taken by the Home Office of boys entering junior detention centre in that same year. Seventy-eight per cent, of them had not previously been dealt with in the community by supervision or by probation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, the overready use by which the courts use custodial sentences at a very early stage in a young person's criminal career is demonstrated by the fact that 17 per cent, of juveniles in detention centres in 1980 were first offenders, 46 per cent, of juveniles entering detention centres in 1980 were only second or third time offenders, and 50 per cent, of those entering borstal in 1980 had two or fewer previous convictions. There does not seem, from that evidence, to be any real reluctance on the part of the courts to pass custodial sentences. There does not seem to be, on that evidence, any suggestion that the courts are passing custodial sentences only when they have explored and exhausted all other alternatives within the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Parris 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Derbyshire, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be so, but I cannot see that the amendment would necessarily stop that happening. The amendment does not stop a court from sending for a custodial sentence someone who has never before been sentenced to a custodial sentence, does it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-SHk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it does not, but it does ensure that there are far more stringent safeguards and a greater presumption on the part of the court to give good reasons why it is necessary—either because all other methods have failed or because the individual is a danger to the public—for a custodial sentence to be imposed. It is my belief that that will itself lead to a reduction in the number of custodial sentences passed on both juveniles and young offenders. We are looking at the myth that the courts already operate a sensitive system and are extremely reluctant to pass custodial sentences, a myth that is already endangered by the collection of statistics that show that first and second and third offenders actually get prison sentences very early on from the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That myth is destroyed completely when one sees the kind of offences that those sentenced to detention centre or borstal have committed. It is not the fact that the vast majority of these juvenile and young offenders are violent, dangerous individuals. Indeed, only 15 per cent, of those sentenced to detention
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
centres in 1980 were convicted of crimes of violenoe, sex or robbery, 18 per cent, of those sentenced to borstal in 1980 were convicted of crimes of violence, sex or robbery and 22 per cent, of those under 21 entering custody had been convicted of the same offences. The picture that tends to be created is that all those sentenced to detention centres, borstals or young prisoner establishments are there only because the court had no other alternative, that it was at the end of its tether and its patience, that it had tried every other measure with these individuals and had failed, and that they were also extremely violent and dangerous individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the myth that we have around us. That is the myth which is created, fostered and nurtured, and it is completely contrary to the truth. The figures are there for anyone to look at, and they demonstrate the point very clearly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, if the amendment is accepted and it is followed in practice, it is my belief that there will be a significant decrease in the proportion of those sentenced to custody. That is supposedly what we all want. If that is intended, the Government can go a long way to achieving it by accepting this series of amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill itself provides two further and extremely powerful arguments in support of the amendment, one of which is relevant to the youth custody sentence and the other to detention centres. I should like first of all to deal with youth custody.

Clause 10 guarantees that a training place will be available only to those who receive sentences of between four and 18 months. Those who are given youth custody sentences of under four months or over 18 months will not necessarily or, indeed, are unlikely, to achieve any sense of training. They will not get a place where a training regime is in existence. Yet, as everyone will acknowledge, those who are given the longer sentences, over 18 months, are probably in greatest need of a training regime, because they are more likely to be subject to institutionalisation by being in there for longer periods of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They will also be cut off from whatever family and friends they have for a longer period than those sentenced for a shorter period of time. Therefore, it would seem to be far more important to give them the element of training than those sentenced to shorter sentences. Indeed the parliamentary all-party penal affairs group in its report "Young Offenders: A Strategy for the Future" recommended that training should be available for all those sentenced to youth custody—education, vocational training, training in acquiring social skills and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognised, however, that the element of training that could be provided would be dependent upon the actual numbers involved. Here we have an opportunity in the amendment to reduce the numbers and, therefore, to try to ensure that the training regimes will be available to all those sentenced to youth custody, not just to those sentenced for periods of between four and 18 months. This amendment has, therefore, another powerful advocate in the Bill itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
The Bill reduces the detention centre sentence minimum from three months to three weeks, which, as I said on Second Reading, is welcome in practice. If courts feel obliged to pass a custodial sentence, it is important that they should have the potential to pass a shorter rather than a longer custodial sentence, but unless stringent safeguards are imposed upon this new power, I think we shall find that courts in practice actually start imposing longer sentences. The result will be that more young people, not fewer, will receive a taste of imprisonment. That fear has been expressed by several organisations, not least the conference of Chief Probation Officers. In its comments on the White Paper, the conference suggested that this change would lead to significantly larger numbers of young offenders being sentenced to custody at an earlier stage in their criminal careers than is the case at present, and it added:
	<br><q><p>"The proposals if implemented could create a situation where in a generation's time, a significant proportion of the population, particularly the male population of certain groups in society, will have had an experience of custody in their early years; an outcome to be viewed, on any reckoning, with serious concern."</p></q>
The prison and borstal governors' branch of the Society of Public Servants expressed similar fears in its
<br><br><!-- lb -->
comments on the White Paper. It stated:
	<br><q><p>"Its effects may actually increase numbers in the custodial system …. There is a real danger that the courts will seize their new powers with enthusiasm and make considerable use of detention."</p></q>
They went on to say:
	<br><q><p>"If our worse fears turn out to be correct and the White Paper's proposals lead to an increase in the young offender population in custody, the entire strategy of this and previous Governments to reduce the prison population will have been undermined.'</p></q>
We believe this to be the most serious and potentially damaging part of the White Paper. Perhaps those hon. Members, not least the Minister, who were quick to get up earlier and defend the image and the reputation of the staff of borstals and detention centres and those who work in penal institutions, would do well to heed those remarks of their professional organisation which is actually expressing fears echoed by many other organisations about what certain proposals in the Bill will do both to the prison population and, therefore, to the working conditions of their members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister of State is as sincere as his earlier intervention would suggest in his concern for the welfare of prison officers and prison staff generally, he will take note of this particular criticism and accept the amendment so as to ensure that the shorter period of detention centre sentences which can now be imposed as a result of the Bill, will not lead to a taste of imprisonment being imposed upon offenders who would otherwise have been sentenced to a non-custodial alternative.
The fears expressed by the prison and borstal governors have been expressed by many other responsible and informed organisations, including— and I want to cite them all, because it is an impressive list of those actually concerned about this aspect of the Bill—the Association of Community Homes; the Association of Directors of Social Services, the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, the British Association of Social Workers, the National Associa-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
tion for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders, the National Association of Probation Officers, the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, the National Youth Bureau and New Approaches to Juvenile Crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its comments on the White Paper, the Association of Directors of Social Services stated that it thought the change could lead, in the longer term, to more young people progressing to youth custody since, when a young person has been in a detention centre for a three-week sentence and re-offends, the courts will see little alternative to a youth custody order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an extremely impressive list of organisations that are not fly-by-nights. They actually have a long, deep and abiding interest in, and knowledge of, young offenders. They work with them day by day at the sharp end. They cover all shades of political opinion. All of them actually believe that this particular Government measure, though welcome in principle, will lead to an increase in the numbers incarcerated in penal institutions in the long run.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that that is not the Government's intention nor, indeed, the intention of the Magistrates' Association. That association advocated the shorter detention centre sentence. It has consistently argued that it should have the ability to impose shorter sentences and the association does not believe or intend that that should be a substitute for non-custodial sentences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, it would be irresponsible to ignore the real figures that have been expressed from such a wide range of informed opinion. For that reason the parliamentary all-party penal affairs group concluded in its report on young offenders:—
	<br><q><p>"While we are persuaded that the case for shorter maximum and minimum detention centre sentences is overwhelming, the implementation of the White Paper's proposals as they stand would almost certainly result in a large increase in the number of young offenders receiving custodial sentences."</p></q>
We therefore recommend that there should be provision for shorter detention centre sentences but that it should be combined with legislative safeguards to ensure that they were used as intended by the Government and by the Magistrates' Association and not used in the way that all the organisations cited actually fear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have therefore proposed a reasonable and moderate amendment that has already commanded wide support from all parties in the House, across the divide of the Committee and outside the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, the Police Federation which has sent the all-party penal affairs group detailed comments on our report on young offenders has expressed its support for this particular proposal. One argument advanced against a proposal of this kind is that magistrates' courts are not experienced in formulating watertight reasons, and that therefore a provision of this kind, if enacted, would give rise to a spate of unnecessary litigation, as those offenders given custodial sentences challenge the stated reasons given in court by magistrates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is reasonable to point out that this provision, if enacted, is not the first requirement of this kind that magistrates have had to meet. The Bail Act 1976 passed with all-party support requires courts when refusing bail to give reasons for their belief that the offender would either abscond or commit another offence, interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the course of justice. Whatever

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
other criticisms have been directed towards the Bail Act—and there have been many—I do not know of any that says that one failing of the Bail Act has been the need for magistrates to give reasons for their decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not one of the difficulties about the Bail Act that magistrates continue to deal with the prisoner in very much the same way that they did, simply take one of the stereotyped reasons in the Act and attach it to their decision in order to justify a decision to remand in custody? Is not one of the difficulties about my hon. Friend's amendment that they will use the same sort of stereotyped reasoning in order to do whatever they want and simply attach one of these reasons as well? Should there not be some kind of commitment that they spell out their reasons in the particular case and identify the criteria that have made them send this person to prison?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not perhaps so sceptical of the courts and their intentions as my hon. Friend, but he has greater experience of them than I. I still believe that magistrates mean what they say, that they do not want to send people to prison unnecessarily and that, therefore, they will accept the kind of principle laid down in this amendment. If my hon. Friend is rights, I have no objection to him tabling a further amendment to toughen up the provisions tabled here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am wondering whether the difficulty expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Lyon) is not dealt with by the provision, as far as magistrates' courts are concerned, of clause 1 (7) which requires a magistrates' court to state the reason for its opinion. Even in this Bill the Government are providing that. All that this amendment does is to put into words what the Government think the reasons would be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. and learned Friend. There is, therefore, no reason at all why the Minister should oppose these amendments. I concluded, I am sure to everybody's great relief, by saying that these amendments, if accepted, would reduce the numbers sentenced to custody. There is also a great deal that could be done in the meantime. The Lord Chief Justice has already tried to ensure some control over the length of prison sentences imposed by the court. He has given a very strong lead, particularly in the cases of Upton and Bibi. This has already lead to a slight reduction in the lengths of prison sentences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows that I do not regard that marginal reduction as important enough to ease the problems of the prison population, but he will accept that any reduction, however marginal, is to be welcomed, Why then in the meantime, cannot the Lord Chief Justice also go a little further and give some practical direction about the use of imprisonment. So far he has talked about the length of sentences. It we cannot get this amendment through or even while we are waiting for it to be enacted, perhaps a great deal could be done if there was an authoritative
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
statement by the Lord Chief Justice or the Lord Chancellor on unnecessary use, as distinct from unnecessary length, of prison sentences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that as a result of the amendment the Home Secretary will discuss the possibility of such an authoritative statement being made by the Lord Chief Justice as a useful move pending legislation on the lines of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by quoting the words of the former Minister of State, the right hon. and learned Member for Cleveland and Whitby (Mr. Brittan), who is now the Chief Financial Secretary to the Treasury. In a speech in Derby on 16 November 1979—and those hon. Gentlemen from the backwoods should perhaps be reminded that this is a Right-Wing Tory Minister at the Home Office speaking, not a Labour Member of Parliament—he said:
	<br><q><p>"… our aim must be to teach the young offenders to live freely in the community without indulging in unacceptable behaviour. And it is obvious, from common sense, from experience and from research, that teaching anyone to come to terms with the community in which he lives must for the most part better be done in that community than in an artificial institutional setting providing supports which will be removed as soon as the youngster returns to his own home."</p></q>
The amendment offers the Government the opportunity to ensure that the wisdom and common sense expressed in those words by the then Minister of State are translated into practice. I therefore hope that they will take this opportunity to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percy Grieve 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Solihull)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee for long. The hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) made a speech of three-quarters of an hour. I am not being critical in saying that. He has a very important contribution to make to our discussion. He has a profound knowledge of the all-party penal affairs group on the subject we are discussing and which will inform all our discussions on the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin, therefore, by saying that I do not dissent for one moment from the words he quoted from the speech of my right hon. and learned Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. I would think that everyone in the Committee would agree with those words. One of the problems we face as a Committee, and which the House faces as a House, is that I suspect we are all united in the ends, which are to produce a population not given to crime, where crime is diminishing instead of increasing, and where young people grow up as useful members of the community rather than recidivists. Some will undoubtedly offend again, and such is human nature, that some people will continue to do until the end of time. Although many of us differ in our philosophical approach to these problems, the end at which we aim is the same. The question is how to achieve it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not follow the argument of the hon. Member for Ormskirk in all its detail or statistics. We cannot determine to what extent custodial sentences are being imposed on the young, except by looking at the increase or decrease, as the case may be—and the hon. Member for Ormskirk has by his figures persuaded us that there has been an increase—of custodial sentences imposed on the young. We must also have regard to the problems which the court faces in dealing with the young when they have been found
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0163">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>51</span>
guilty of serious offences. As the number of young committing serious offences has gone on increasing over the years, it is inevitable, is it not, that the number committed to custodial sentences should also increase? I will not detain the Committee for long with quotations. I propose to make only one. There is a significant passage in the report of the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis for the year 1980 at page 3, where he deals with crime. He says:
	<br><q><p>"Regrettably the downward trend in serious crime as reflected in the figures of the past two years was not repeated in 1980. The total number of serious crimes recorded was 5 per cent, more than the 1979 figure and greater in actual number than the previous peak figure recorded in 1977. This increase occurred despite determined police efforts, demonstrated, in part, by the number of serious offences cleared up being 3 per cent, higher than in 1979."</p></q>
I read that as a preliminary, but now I come to the important matter dealing with juveniles. The report says:
	<br><q><p>"While any increase in crime is unwelcome the rise in robbery and burglary gives most cause for concern. Robbery figures increased from 6,232 in 1979" —</p></q>
it will be remembered that we are dealing only with the metropolis—
	<br><q><p>"to 7,585 and burglary increased from 116,873 to 125,806. Of those arrested for robbery 60 per cent, were under 21 years, and of those arrested for burglary 67 per cent, were under that age."</p></q>
I think the Committee will agree that robbery, by its nature, is one of the most serious offences, short of murder or rape, in the calendar of crime and one of which far too many elderly people in the metropolis have been victims over recent years. There is a tendency nowadays to suggest that only crimes of violence merit custodial sentences, but I venture to suggest that burglary of private dwelling houses is one of the most serious offences which is rife today. Sometimes it is accompanied by appalling vandalism, particularly when committed by the young. There must be a strong case when there has been burglary in a private dwelling house, accompanied by vandalism, for a custodial sentence to be imposed, even though the person has not been before the court for such an offence before and it may be, on paper, a first offence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why? What is the reason for suggesting that a burglary by a person who has not committed burglary before should merit a custodial sentence? The hon. and learned Gentleman simply conveys the stereotyped tariff mentality of the judiciary which has led to people being sent to prison for that kind of offence when it is totally unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that the hon. Gentleman should think that I am reflecting the stereotyped tariff judgment of the judiciary. I am not reflecting anything of the kind. I am reflecting the desire of the public to be protected against the invasion of their homes by offenders who not only help themselves to the goods inside but by acts of vandalism damage, sometimes in horrible ways, the homes which they have thus invaded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Nicholas Lyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Hemel Hempstead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. and learned Friend not agree that in London the detection rate for this kind of offence is desperately
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
small and that while that should not be allowed to affect the individual sentence, the seriousness and frequency of this crime is becoming a major problem? Secondly, does he not agree that when somebody's house is burgled not only may his goods be taken and his house damaged, but he may be frightened and severely affected over a long period?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I entirely agree with my hon. and learned Friend. He has put the point succinctly and clearly. It is one of the most worrying crimes faced by the courts, the police and the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to my objection to the amendments proposed by the hon. Member for Ormskirk. There is a superficial attraction in defining further what is appropriate punishment. There is a superficial attraction in seeking to define further what is appropriate. It is only a superficial attraction. The gallant attempt which the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends have made so to define it is unduly restrictive. I shall read Amendment No. 4 and then deal with it in light of the point that I have just made. It states:
	<br><q><p>"because he has shown himself unable or unwilling to respond to non-custodial penalties or because a custodial sentence is necessary for the protection of the public."</p></q>
I take the second limb of that first—
	<br><q><p>"necessary for the protection of the public."</p></q>
I suspect that most courts would impose a sentence necessary for the protection of the public only in cases where it was shown that the person before the court had offended repeatedly. For example, the court may feel that he had committed a crime so serious— such as rape—that it was essential he be sent to prison, even though he may never have offended before. That is one aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other aspect relates to the phrase
	<br><q><p>"unable or unwilling to respond to non-custodial penalties."</p></q>
What is to be done with the young person who has never appeared before the court, who has never been put on probation, been the subject of conditional discharge, or fined but who, nevertheless, comes before the court for a serious offence of the kind that I have ventured to analyse?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be a young man who, with some friends, has broken into a private house, not only stolen from it but wantonly destroyed large parts of the contents, ripped-up curtains, possibly defecated on the carpet— a not uncommon thing—and then appears before the court. Is it to be said that in such circumstances the court should, on no account, pass a custodial sentence? It would not be right to say that that was essential for the protection of the public because there would be no suggestion that the young man would necessarily offend again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it not essential, in such circumstances, that the disapprobation of society and a lesson to the young man, should be marked by a short, custodial sentence of the kind that is provided in the Bill? For those reasons, I suggest that the proposed amendment is too restrictive and we ought not to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Accrington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The aim of the Bill is to ensure that fewer juveniles and young people are sent to, and serve sentences in custody. That has been stated over and over again. Although the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0164">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>53</span>
accent of the Bill is on providing a variety of custodial methods of treatment, its purpose is to ensure that the courts use those treatments only as a last resort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a laudable aim and I support the amendment and the sentiments expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's aim can only be achieved if the courts themselves act in the spirit of that aim. If there is a significant decrease in juvenile crime, the Government will have made a major contribution to the course of penal reform. That should be stated because the Government would deserve every credit for doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Bill intentions will fail if the courts frustrate its purpose by using the shorter detention centre and youth custody sentences as a normal option rather than as a genuine last resort. That, similarly, would be a tragedy for all the exhortations by a succession of Government Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to repeat the startling and depressing figures that were revealed by my hon. Friend about the re-conviction rates of young offenders and juveniles, particularly those who have been sentenced to a period detention centre or borstal treatment. By any assessment they are startling and depressing. The only conclusion one can reach—and I put it modestly —is that those forms of treatment, custodial incarceration have been anything but successful in reforming those who have been treated in that way to make them better suited to become normal, decent, respectable and law-abiding members of society.
	<br><q><p>"We are locking up three times as many young people under the age of 17 as we were 20 years ago."</p></q>
These are the words of the Under-Secretary of State, Lord Belstead speaking to the Third Community Service National Seminar at Keele university in 1981. He went on:
	<br><q><p>"One is driven to the conclusion that we are not making sufficient use of the wide range of alternatives to custody which exist."</p></q>
Everybody concerned with penal affairs and the treatment of young offenders has come to the same conclusion. My hon. Friend read out a most impressive list of organisations that share that concern and have all reached the same conclusion. They cannot all be wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3 of the Government's White Paper, "Young Offenders" which again my hon. Friend read out, sets the background to this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment puts those sentiments, by using the same words, into the Bill. Nobody will be so naive as to believe that by putting the words on the Amendment Paper into the Bill it will transform the magistrates in their sentencing policy. That would be a simplistic view. None the less, successive exhortations by Ministers have not proved successful. At least by putting these words in the Bill it would be a constant reminder to magistrates and the courts that custodial sentences should genuinely be a last resort, rather than the normal form of treatment because it happens to be in the Bill. Short sentences may solve the conscience of magistrates because it will be easy to say "They are only going to detention centre for three weeks; they are only going to serve a short
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
period of youth custody. That is the normal sensible way of dealing with them." But alternatives that have been provided can and will be neglected unless something more specifio than exhortation, something more binding than Home Office circulars, is put into the Bill and put, therefore, before the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. A. Trippier 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Rossendale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that not precisely what happens at the moment? Do not magistrates or people in the higher courts already consider all the things he has mentioned? I cannot see the necessity for introducing an amendment at this stage. Does he not accept that where custodial sentences are given without the offender having experienced any non-custodial form of sentence in the past, it may reflect the seriousness of the crime committed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sometimes it may well reflect it, but frequently it does not. I want to ensure that the maximum guidance is given to magistrates to ensure that the sentence does reflect the seriousness of the crime or, conversely, reflects the lack of real seriousness. It appears to be obligatory to say—although I do not know why—that I in no way condone the increase in juvenile crime. It is alarming and disturbing. Anyone in his right senses could not but view it in that light. We are concerned with how best to deal with that. Certainly all the figures that have been quoted reveal that the standard way of doing it—of locking them up for whatever period—does not appear to have been in any sense successful. There must be a better alternative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While my hon. and learned Friend is on this point, would he not also accept the evidence of the DHSS report, "Offending by Young People: A Survey of Recent Trends", published in 1981, that, contrary to what the hon. Gentlemen and the hon. and learned Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve) have said, the increase in the number of boys sent to borstal and detention centre since 1965 is not related to the increase in crime? In fact, the number of juveniles sent to detention centres and borstals has increased five-fold since 1965 and less than a fifth of that rise relates directly to increased offending. That was a DHSS report last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is remarkable that my hon.Friend should have intervened because that was exactly what I was about to say. Nevertheless, he has made the point. After dealing with the figures that my hon. Friend has presented, the report said:
	<br><q><p>"About a quarter of the increase in custodial sentences since 1969 can be related to the rise in the number of offences. About a third is attributable to more frequent custodial sentences for theft and another quarter to the more frequent custodial sentences for burglary."</p></q>
So all the increases in custodial sentences cannot be said to relate solely to an increase in serious crime among juveniles and young offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a modest amendment. It will help the Government to achieve their purpose and to make the measure more successful. As I said, it may well be one of the most significant penal reform measures to have appeared on the statute book for many years. I have dealt with this briefly. My hon. Friend has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0165">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>55</span>
dealt at great length with the figures, but I hope that the Minister will be able to accept the amendment. I cannot see what harm the amendment can do, even if—putting it at its most modest—it does not achieve the aims that the Opposition claim for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Bradford, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a point of legal construction that worries me about the amendment. The Bill as drafted says that no one under 21 shall be sentenced custodially unless:
	<br><q><p>"no other method of dealing with him is appropriate."</p></q>
This amendment appears to say, looking at it as a lawyer, that if a person has never been in trouble before, if there is no evidence that he is unable or unwilling to respond to non-custodial penalties, and he then commits a very serious offence such as rape or even murder, he cannot be sentenced custodially unless the sentence is necessary for the protection of the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ask what those words mean. If there is evidence, medical and other, that this young man will commit no further offence and, therefore, his liberty will not endanger the public, it seems to me that under this amendment, looking at it purely legally, there will be no power in the court to sentence him to any custodial sentence, either for murder or a very serious offence of rape. If that is what is wanted, I understand the purpose of the movers of the amendment. I believe that they are well-motivated, but 1 wonder whether they appreciate—I am open to correction—that the words—
	<br><q><p>"necessary for the protection of the public"</p></q> refer to the future in relation to the individual himself. If he does nothing wrong in the future, there is no power in this amendment to give him any kind of custodial sentence at all. That is what worries me. I wonder if the hon. Gentleman would comment on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. and learned Gentleman's concern. He has given a legalistic view, but I do not share it. Clearly if it is a serious offence such as rape or an offence of violence of an extreme nature, the criteria of public interest covers it. Any court would have to state its reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am quite satisfied that that would not hamper the court sending someone to prison who ought to be sent to prison. It is a construction that the hon. and learned Gentleman puts on it, but I do not share it. I do not think it would hamper the courts in that way, though no doubt the Minister, will make that very point. I can see that the hon. and learned Gentleman is dying to leap up and make that point. However, I urge the Minister, despite the strictures of the hon. and learned Gentleman, to accept this amendment. In my view, it will assist the Government in ensuring that fewer youngsters who ought not to be in custody are not sent to custody.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Pitt 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Croydon, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could echo the remarks of the hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) and reassure my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons) that it is not our intention to allow extremely violent criminals and rapists, even
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
first offenders to receive a non-custodial sentence when it is quite clear from the last part of the amendment that anybody who needs a custodial sentence for the protection of the public must still receive one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The construction that my hon. and learned Friend has put on the amendment is valid, but I assure hon. Members that that is not our intention. I am not a lawyer and I bow with due respect to those lawyers in this Committee—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, you do not do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still have some respect for the legal profession. However, I feel that this construction would not be put on it if the amendment was put to test. The nub of this argument is not whether we discuss individual cases or offences, but rather the whole essence and debate with regard to custodial sentencing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) told us that borstal and detention centre admissions are up by more than 100 per cent, in 10 years, yet the recidivism rates in both borstal training and detention centres have risen astronomically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He also said that custody in itself is dehumanising and I would concur with him wholeheartedly—again, without meaning to criticise in any way prison officers and those in charge of deten ion centres who have an appalling and dehumanising job to do. The whole ethos of custody is abhorrent to me, and that is the spirit in which the amendment is raised and the spirit in which we should be discussing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems we are relying on custodial sentences as a method of dealing with a problem which we cannot face, and that problem is how to reduce the increasing crime rate, and how to reassure the public that the Government are coping with the increasing crime rate. Each attempt at a custodial sentence is a failure in itself because, as I said on Second Reading, we are sending young people on a promotion ladder— starting with a minor sentence and moving up through borstal training to prison. We are institutionalising recidivism. The Young Adult Offenders Report of 1974 stated in paragraph 48:
	<br><q><p>"… a major switch from custody supervision in the community."—</p></q>
and is an important issue that we should look at most strongly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Home Office survey which was carried out between 1 July and 31 December 1977 showed that just over 35 per cent, of those people entering borstal training had not received a previous supervision order or probation order. We should be most concerned that this trend is increasing, that we are relying far too much on custodial sentences for solving our problems and not upon more creative uses of our time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of violence, I am expecting the Government to point out—and rightly so—the increase in crimes of violence. The hon. and learned Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve) pointed out the increase in robbery and burglary. As I said earlier, our amendment is not designed to let out people who have committed crimes of violence—whether they be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0166">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
against a person or against property, from whom society should rightly be protected—to be endured by society further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to 'resent a facility whereby—certainly for first offenders—there is no need for the kind of protection that custody gives for the public. In other words, they would be given sentences which would enable them to become creative members of society. The cost of custodial sentences is £150 per week for a person in a youth custody centre, for example, or in some other form of custodial sentencing, while it costs £350 per annum per offender in an attendance centre or on a probation order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recidivism rates are rising fast so we should question closely the efficacy—as the hon. Member for Ormskirk has already said—of a policy of continual custodial sentencing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendall) referred last week to children as "puppy dogs", I ask the Government whether that is a reflection of their views and, on that basis, are they concerned more with treating our young offenders by Pavlovian methods so that, in so doing, we get a conditioned reflex from young people? If we get a conditioned reflex from young people they will no! grow into creative members of society. They will react to whatever they are told.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose it is inevitable that the hon. Gentlemen is now making the same speech for the third time about creative custodial sentences. In admonishing my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendall)—who, in effect, was trying to point out that some punishment should be given to these offenders—is the hon. Gentlemen saying, in all the community idea that he has put forward, particularly about first offenders, that there is no room in his argument for some form of punishment for these people who offend against society?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course there is room in my argument for punishment, but punishment does not necessarily have to be inflicted by taking a person out of society and putting him or her into a box or a cell. Punishment can be inflicted on people by the loss of their time. If an offender, has to go to a detention centre, if he is on probation, if he has to make up to society for what he has done by activity within that society— which is why I use the word "creative"—that is a way of making him realise that he has committed an offence against society, while he is still in society and has to face it every day. If one takes that person out of society, he does not have to face society for a period of time. There is no proof that custodial sentences are efficacious in reducing the crime rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me finish by commenting on the opening remarks of the hon. and learned Member for Solihull, to whom we are all grateful for his detailed knowledge of robbery and burglary. He said that everyone in the Committee subscribed to the end of producing, by a variety of means, a population where crime is diminishing and not increasing. How are we to achieve that end? Crime rates have been increasing rapidly since the war, robbery and burglary particularly, and crimes of violence and vandalism. Borstal training
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
intake has increased by 100 per cent, in 10 years. Recidivism rates from borstal training and detention centres have increased alarmingly. The amendment would be a way of preventing crime and treating young offenders in a proper way within society by methods more economically suitable and useful. It would be a more creative way of dealing with the appalling increase in crime suffered over the last 30 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it would be convenient to the Committee for me to give now an indication of the Government's approach to the amendment. We have had a debate of great value. I agree with my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve) that it has been distinguished by a sharing of objectives. I think that I can probably narrow the objectives a little more closely. His objective, upon which we are all agreed, is to seek to find the secret of a non-crime-committing society. In this context we are concentrating primarily upon young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think, however, that we can narrow the argument a little more closely because we are all concerned to encourage the development of non-custodial sentences for the courts to ensure that a young offender is given a custodial or residential sentence only where, by reason of the gravity of the offence or the gravity of his record, it is unavoidable in practical terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) moved the amendment in a fair and knowledgeable way. We are all agreed on those objectives. So perhaps it is a little trite to say that the real question is how we go about it. The Government would like to consider further all that has been said so far on both sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not easy to decide how best Parliament can ensure by the language it uses that it is giving to the courts the clearest guidance possible on its intentions. Our intentions are, as they have been the intentions of our predecessors for at least 30 years, to impose some constraint upon the power of the courts to send young people into custody. That goes right back to the 1948 Act, and indeed beyond that. It is clear from what has been said in this Committee and, indeed, more widely that there is concern as to whether the courts can be given clearer guidance than in the word " appropriate " and in the words which require them to seek and to heed information about the circumstances of the offence and the offender—in other words, clearer guidance as to the circumstances in which we believe custody should be awarded. Although we certainly want to consider further the wording of the amendment and what has been said, we see, at present, obstacles to this formula and I should like to take the time of the Committee briefly to explain why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is necessary to find some sensible course between leaving the courts to impose custodial sentences in whatever way they choose and circumscribing their powers to the point where they have no real discretion at all. I think that everybody who has spoken in this Committee has recognised that the courts are not red in tooth and claw and that they are not anxious to send people away without any regard to the kind of considerations which have exercised us here today. That is absolutely plain and I am very glad that there has been such universal acceptance of the spirit in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0167">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>59</span>
which the courts seek to perform the extremely difficult function of sentencing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 of the Bill seeks to find some sensible course by means of a general provision requiring the court to be of the opinion that no other method of dealing with the offender is appropriate before it can pass a custodial sentence. It is also required to take certain information into account in reaching that opinion, and the amendment seeks to impose a further restriction by setting out two, and only two, grounds on which a court can base its opinion that nothing but custody is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 1 (4) a court could not generally impose a custodial sentence upon a young offender unless it is of the opinion that no other method of dealing with him is appropriate. The amendment would add guidelines to what the court must consider in reaching that opinion by specifying that the offender must have
	<br><q><p>"shown himself unable or unwilling to respond to non-custodial penalties or—</p></q>
that
	<br><q><p>"a custodial sentence is necessary for the protection of the public."</p></q>
I pause here to acknowledge at once that the wording is taken more or less in toto from paragraph 3 of the White Paper, and I shall seek to distinguish between the wisdom in a White Paper or in discussions setting forth in terms like that the considerations that are to be taken into account and—here is the point of the hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons)—the practicality of importing them into statutory language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In effect, the court would be able, if this amendment were carried, to pass a custodial sentence only where one of those two conditions was satisfied. The inevitable danger in defining circumstances in which a case will be inappropriate for a custodial sentence is that one excludes all other circumstances. Are we satisfied that it would be right to exclude all other circumstances than the two referred to in the amendment.?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One also tends to induce in the sentence a kind of vision where he ought to be able to take as wide a view of the whole circumstances of the case as possible and then—and only then—use his informed judgment and discretion and apply that to the individual case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say "informed" because—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What circumstances does the hon. and learned Gentleman think ought to be taken into account? Perhaps we can amend the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We want to consider this. If one says, for example, that a person has shown himself unable or unwilling, one must consider whether that means that he must have had experience of a non-custodial sentence first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What other circumstances could there be? Many people would say that it was implicit in the wording of the amendment that there must already have been passed upon him a non-custodial sentence and he must have shown himself unable to respond to it. I do not know whether that is the case, but if I wanted to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
adhere to this criterion. I should not want it to be said that a person could only show himself to be unable or unwilling by reason of having failed in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to make a debating point, but I am seeking information. The hon. and learned Gentleman is obviously entitled to make that point but, if he makes it, we are entitled to ask what the Government meant in the White Paper by using those precise words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have indicated, it is an entirely acceptable and helpful use of a White Paper or a forum type of discussion to indicate what, without doubt, must be the major criteria that a court will want to consider. But they are not exclusive. At least, I am not satisfied that they are exclusive. For example, a person may have a grave record. It may be necessary to take that into account even though one is not satisfied that he has shown himself unable or unwilling to respond to a non-custodial sentence. We all, with the experience of the courts, know of sentencers who take a bold risk and say, " You have never had probation. You have had several custodial sentences. You have never had probation and we are prepared here to take a risk, to take a very lenient course and to put you on probation". By the same token, it could not be said that, by reason of his failure under a non-custodial sentence earlier passed upon him, he had shown himself unwilling or unable to respond to one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I use that example not because I am seeking to say that these two criteria are not the major ones that a court will take into account. Of course, they are the major ones that a court will take into account, but they are not the only ones. I have already indicated that a court might wish to say, " By reason of the gravity of your record, we shall not be able to pass an appropriate sentence if it is not a custodial one ". After all, courts do have to take into account the need to hold the confidence of the communities they serve. They must do that. Anybody who says that the courts can be completely divorced from any concern for the confidence of the communities they serve is not being realistic. It is not the over riding consideration of which a sentencer has to take account. If he ignores it, confidence in the administration of justice may be weakened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Members continue to press me, I shall be obliged to advise my hon. Friends to reject the amendment if it is taken to a Division. I am simply seeking to explain why we wish to consider the point further. We all want to ensure that Parliament's intentions as to the circumstances in which custody shall and shall not be able to be awarded are communicated to the courts in the most helpful way possible. The amendments do not seem to us to meet that bill, because they concentrate on the two exclusive considerations and induce what I have ventured to call a kind of tunnel vision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: " Read out the rest." I probably could read out the rest. I suspect that there are quite a number. I exclude the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin), the hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) and the hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons), but I think that many Labour Members, when the chips are down, do not trust the magistrates and the judges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What better example could there be of not trusting the judges than the Government's example of taking away their discretion—as it does in the Bill—to give indeterminate sentences for borstal training?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has shown an uncharacteristic carelessness. The whole point about the provision to end the indeterminate sentences— whose length rests upon the decision of the Executive as represented by staff in, let us say, a borstal institution—is to emphasise the confidence that we have in the judges' discretion to determine, in the light of all the circumstances of the case what is the appropriate custodial sentence. The hon. Gentleman accepts this. He is in favour of it. He has said on many occasions that the courts ought to be able to say how long somebody will be deprived of his liberty, and that this should not be left to the discretion of a member of the Executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must not take too long on this, but I have to do justice to a speech that took 45 minutes. It is of crucial importance, I believe, that Parliament should trust the judges, though hon. Members have said they do not trust them. I believe that Parliament should trust them, but that it ought to give them the clearest possible guidance as to what is in our mind. The strength of the Committee is that we share a common mind as to the objectives of the Bill. We do not want young offenders going into custody unless in practical terms it is unavoidable. I was glad to hear the hon. Member for Ormskirk acknowledge that young offenders had to go into custody when they were dangerous or a danger to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saying that one could rely upon judicial discretion being informed. That is important. It is sometimes suggested in wilder speeches that sentencing is determined by whim and by the seat of the ermine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
That simply is not true. The classical principles of sentencing were set out by Lord Justice Lawton and were quoted by the Advisory Council on the Penal System. They referred to the need for retribution, the need for deterrence, the need for prevention and the need for rehabilitation. The point that Lord Justice Lawton was making was that these have to be balanced. You cannot take one and give it pre-eminence over the others. Those are classical principles. It is the art of the sentencer using his experience, using his judgment and his discretion, to get the right balance in the circumstances of the individual case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is generally accepted now that custodial sentences should not be imposed with a view to their rehabilitative prospects. Reform remains one of the objectives of the costdial regime provided for young offenders, but the evidence makes it clear that the prospects of successful reform are too small to justify custody on this basis. The extent to which a custodial sentence on a young offender is justified on any, or all, of the principles of retribution, deterrence or prevention, must depend on the seriousness of the offence and the circumstances. It is difficult to see how that seriousness can be measured in statutory terms in a way that gives the courts helpful guidance and constrains them towards custodial sentences in only those exceptional cases where public policy demands it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One fears that in practice the courts would not find such statutory guidelines helpful nor that they would make any material difference to their sentencing practices. That is the point. As I was pressed for examples of where the two criteria in this amendment might be inadequate in a particular case, I should like to put forward another for consideration. This was a point made by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve). A serious offence may be committed by a young offender who has not shown himself previously unable or unwilling to respond to a non-custodial sentence—he may never have had one—of whom it is probably true that he will not re-offend. But the gravity of the offence that he has committed can properly call for a custodial sentence, albeit not a long one. That is the type of case that all of us with experience of these matters know can occur. It is perfectly proper for a court to take into account the fact that notwithstanding that a man has committed a really serious offence and is given a non-custodial sentence, people who will not know the full circumstances of the case may be led to suppose that he can get away with it and the community at large, which this court has to serve, may well lose confidence in the administration of justice. That would be a proper consideration, but such a case would not be met in that way if the amendment were carried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present criterion for the courts is embodied in section 19 of the Powers of the Criminal Courts Act and that goes back to 1948. That formula is in the Bill, save that it is now extended to youth custody and sometimes to detention. It was clearly pointed out by the hon. Member for Ormskirk that this was an advance. Although it may seem to leave the matter somewhat at large, because it is imprecise to use the words of the hon. and learned Member for Accrington, the courts certainly do not lack authoritative guidance under our system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>63</span>
I want to say a word about this because it is extremely important. It has already been touched upon in references to the Lord Chief Justice's guidance. The hon. Member for Ormskirk said that the Lord Chief Justice had given strong guidance. He also said —I think this is the first time that this has been acknowledged from the Opposition—that the guidance of the Lord Chief Justice and the Court of Appeal has already begun to take effect. He said that there had been a slight reduction in sentences. I am extremely glad that has been acknowledged. It is an encouraging sign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know of the cases of Upton and Bibi. They are the cases in which that guidance was set out by the Court of Appeal. However, as the Lord Chief Justice's views indicate, the courts in this country attach great importance to the individual circumstances of each case and are reluctant to attempt to codify sentencing into guidelines with any specificity. As the LordChief Justice said in the case of Bibi:
	<br><q><p>"We are not aiming at uniformity of sentences. That would be impossible. We are aiming at uniformity of approach."</p></q>
I paid particular attention to the suggestion that the Lord Chief Justice might be able to give further guidance on the use that ought properly to be made of imprisonment along the lines suggested by the hon. Member for Ormskirk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why do the Government accept that it is proper for judges to be directed by the Lord Chief Justice and the Court of Appeal about the principles that they should apply but not right for Parliament to write into the statute the kind of principle about which the hon. and learned Gentleman says we all agree? Why is it wrong for Parliament to do it but not for the Lord Chief Justice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon) will distinguish between the guide-ance that can be given in the form of a judgment and the guidance that can be given in legislative language in a statute. I do not believe that we can ever legislate in the terms of the Bibi judgments, and he knows why. The judges are able, through the law reports, to pick up the flavour, the thrust and general character of guidance given in the language appropriate to a judgment in a way that they cannot in the necessarily condensed language of a clause in a statute. He also knows that under our system every word that is included in a statute is subject to the closest scrutiny —not always with realistic results; but that is our system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one is seeking to find the most effective way of putting constraints upon the power to imprison young offenders, guidance from the Lord Chief Justice and the Court of Appeal has many advantages over restrictions that are placed upon a word such as "appropriate" in a stalutory provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are substantial difficulties about formula adopted in the amendments. They depend on less than does the present draft provision on subjective analysis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The words
	<br><q><p>"shown himself unable or unwilling"</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
depends upon subjective analysis. Even worse, it is analysis made on a record that has to be taken from paper, or in a rare case, a witness's account, but generally fIom a record of prvrious convictions. One has to form a subjective analysis from that, without knowing the full circumstances. A to the words
	<br><q><p>"the protection of the public".</p></q>
one may form a view that this man, having committed a grave offence must go inside. For the reasons that I have outlined, there would be a temptation to say that the protection of the public requires it, whereas it may not necessarily be so. This is not the precise constraint that it might appear at first sight. In an attempt to be more precise, these words conceal a quicksand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come on to the drafting points. I shall not spend long on these because they are not the whole burden of the matter. Do the words
	<br><q><p>"shown himself unable or unwilling to respond to non-custodial penalties."</p></q>
mean that he must have had one already, or can he show himself "unable or unwilling" without having suffered? This is important. If we are to depart from a formula that has been on the statute book since 1948, we should be absolutely certain that we give clearer guidance, not more imprecise and ambiguous guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I take the sense of the Committee, I do not believe that it wants to hear drafting points. I revert to what I said at the beginning. We should like to consider the important speeches that have been made and to consider whether the formula, albeit that it has been on the statute book since 1948, is capable of improvement. If I have assisted the Committee as to the Government's approach to the amendment, T shall be satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister began and ended his speech by saying that the Government would consider everything that has been said. In the middle and major part of his speech, he seemed to be giving his personal considerations. The Government have a sound reason for wanting to consider the precise wording. The Government have no sound reason for rejecting in principle the idea of giving guidance in the statute of which the courts can take advantage— indeed, of which they would be obliged to take advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make the admission—if it is an admission—that I trust the judiciary provided that the judiciary has adequate guidance. If it has not, any member of the judiciary, however able, eminent or experienced, is liable on occasions to be diverted by the particular factors of a particular case—by whether he believes a particular type of offence to be a prominent one in a particular area, and matters of that kind—that are totally divorced from the real matters that ought to be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I refer to the real matters that ought to be taken into account—I hope, by the Minister and the Government apart from the judiciary—I refer to what the Bill and the Explanatory Memorandum say. The Explanatory Memorandum tells us that part I
	<br><q><p>"implements proposals in the White Paper."</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>65</span>
In clause 2, for example, there is no reluctance on the part of the Government to define clearly and restrict-ively the circumstances in which a person shall be sent to detention. It might well be said that the provisions of clause 2 (5) ought not to be in the Bill because we ought to trust the judiciary. We ought to expect that the judiciary would never send a person to detention if such a sentence were unsuitable because of his mental or physical condition. We might well take the view that he should not be sent to detention if he served a sentence such as is specified in subsection (5) 	<i>(b).</i> But the Government rightly wish their policy on detention to be absolutely clear in relation to detention centres. It is equally appropriate that they should make their intentions absolutely clear in relation to the whole question of custodial sentences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill goes a long way already. It provides that no such sentence should be passed unless the court is of the opinion that no other method of dealing with the offender is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will that offend the judiciary? It is almost stating the obvious. Clause 1 (6) sets out in detail the kind of information that the court is required to have before it decides what to do in dealing with such an offender: It must:
	<br><q><p>"… obtain and consider information about the circumstances, and shall take into account any information … relevant to his character and his physical and mental condition."</p></q>
Is that unduly restrictive of, or likely to offend, the judiciary when it is putting into words something that any court with any common sense at all would be likely to do in any event?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 (7) provides that the court, having given that consideration and guiding itself by the provisions of subsection (4), is required to—
	<br><q><p>"… state the reason for its opinion that no other method of dealing with him is appropriate, and cause that reason to be … entered in the register."</p></q>
It will then be seen for all to go by and, if necessary, form the basis upon which an appeal can be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all these respects, the Government are accepting that it is right for Parliament closely and strictly to confine the way in which a court operates rather than to give it the sort of discretion that is sometimes argued for when it is suggested that courts should be totally trusted in their approach to sentencing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall speak to my own amendment, because it would be surprising if I did not think that it was superior to my hon. Friend's and, indeed, superior to the words of the White Paper. It seeks to incorporate in the Bill, in addition to these various other matters, the very considerations that the Explanatory Memorandum, by saying that the Bill implements the proposals in the White Paper, suggests ought to be incorporated in order to implement them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper makes it absolutely clear what the Government then had in mind and, while listening to the middle part of the Minister's speech, I wondered whether they had departed from what they had in mind and whether they ought to change the wording of the Explanatory Memorandum to "the Government are implementing only to some degree" what is contained in the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper says, as plaintly as anything can say, that
	<br><q><p>"The Government is doing as much as possible to encourage the development of non-custodial facilities so that the courts may continue"—</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
I emphasise the words "may continue"—
	<br><q><p>"to have a range of alternatives sufficient to ensure than an offender is given a custodial or residential sentence only when he is a real danger to society or has shown himself unwilling or unable to respond to non-custodial penalties."</p></q>
Do the Government go back on that? Do they think that that is not the right approach and that there should be some different approach? If so, what different approach do they suggest? Do they go back on what they have suggested in the Bill—implementing those provisions of the White Paper? If so, in what way do they want to go back on that implementation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that the wording of the amendment is not necessarily perfect simply because it is taken from the Government's White Paper. I hope that the motive behind it will be recognised as being very good indeed. It simply seeks to put into the Bill the Government's intention to implement the White Paper. How better can they do that than by using the very words of the White Paper?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What dismays me about the Minister's reply is that having expressed the Government's willingness to consider what has been said—and therefore, I take it, at least to consider bringing forward their own amendment which while modifying our amendment a little none the less maintains the basic principles of paragraph 3 of the White Paper—he seemed to branch off into all kinds of reasons why there might be other grounds than those contained in the White Paper for the imposition of a custodial sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot speak for my Front Bench, but I am quite sure that my hon. Friends and members of the all-party penal affairs group would be very willing to accept a proposal by the Minister, the effect of which was that in due course he would accept the spirit of the amendment, even if he found that the wording was not absolutely clear or precise. We would willingly accept that on Repor the could come forward with an amendment giving effect to the spirit of ours, altering the words, if that should be necessary, to cover certain things that we may not perhaps have appreciated, or the Government may not have appreciated when they formulated paragraph 3 of the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he says that I, at any rate, will be satisfied. If he leaves the matter as it now stands, I shall not be satisfied, because it appears to me that the Government are not sincere in saying that they seek to implement the provisions of the White Paper. I hope that the Government are in fact being sincere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

What he said was really neither one thing nor the other. He said that maybe we have got a case, but was not really sure whether he could come back with anything better. In those circumstances I, at any rate, would not be happy to leave the matter in that particular setting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I still cannot understand quite what happened between the thinking behind the White Paper and the writing of the words in the Bill. What persuaded the draftsman and the makers of policy, if I may put it in

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>67</span>
that way, to slide back from the more specific words used in the White Paper to the less specific and looser words in the Bill? I do not want to labour the arguments that have been put several times already this morning about the alarming rate of re-conviction of young offenders who have been in custodial sentence and who have gone back again. We are all quite clear that we do not want to send young people into custody if we can possibly avoid doing so. We must try to think about the individuals with whom we are concerned. From what I have read, and from the valuable contribution that has been made by the all-party Committee—of which I am not a member, but I have read its documents closely—it seems to me that a great number of young offenders become tougher and are less able to readjust to society after being put in custody for the first time. They are, therefore, more likely to return to it on a second occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, a second occasion is not quite as alarming as the first. Such people, in some respects, obviously become more anti-social because of the very fact that they are in custody. We need to ensure that the non-custodial penalties—or I prefer my right hon. and learned Friend's words "methods of treatment"—are explored on every conceivable occasion before children—let us face it, most of them are— are incarcerated in places that might harm rather than help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I visited a borstal a couple of years ago and saw a youngster from my constituency who had arrived only a week before. He was a little shrimp of a lad, and was in a very sad state indeed. A policewoman had stopped him and some of his friends—I do not know whether they were up to any good or not—and he had shaken her off. She had managed to slip off the kerb and break her ankle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That had landed him, against the advice of the probation officer, in borstal for four months. He was very unhappy indeed, and worried about his future and what would happen to him when he was in custody. I came away feeling quite satisfied that, with the treatment he would get, he would come out and be a model lad again. I was therefore upset to find, because I kept in touch with the case and with the probation officer, that he was back in borstal a year later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When he came out of borstal he was not just a member of his own little gang on his own estate, he was a hero because he had been in borstal. He had grown up. He had become a man. He had learned rather tougher ways. I do not think that is the sort of thing that we should encourage. I think that we must give the court every power to explore all the non-custodial methods of treatment before they commit youngsters to this kind of treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was talking to a friend recently about this Bill. He has been a magistrate only for a very short time and he tells me that often when hearing a case in court he shudders at some of the cases coming before him and thinks: " There but for the grace of God go I ". I look around at hon. Members and, indeed, at my hon. Friends and wonder we can remember what it was like to be very young.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may be able to do so, but from some of the comments, I sometimes wonder whether Conservative Members cannot recall occasions on which they had committed something that might have been turned into an offence. That is probably true of every one of us in one way or another. We either were not caught or we were not in the circumstances in which we thought that it was a particularly bad thing to do. We are all very respectable pillars of society now and makers of the laws, but we should sometimes reflect upon how we behaved when we were kids and whether we were all quite as perfect and as good as we now like people to believe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will speak again before we finalise this debate and give us more assurance than he has already been able to do, that he will come back with words that more adequately reflect the amendment. I hope that my hon. Friend will not necessarily withdraw his amendment unless we have that assurance from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee would refrain from referring to " the judiciary" in the clauses which we are debating, and would talk about judges. The Committee needs to be reminded that the vast majority of cases which we are discussing will be determined by a bench of magistrates. I have the figures for 1980, when the total number of detention centre orders on offenders aged 14 to 21 was roughly 12,600, of which about 10,000 were passed by the magistrates' court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that I advisedly used the word "judiciary " to include both the higher judges and the magistrates?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that in most of the discussion this morning, most hon. Members, except, perhaps, for the right hon. and learned Gentleman, have referred to judges as opposed to magistrates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point on which many Labour Members have failed to comment, or to answer the points that the Minister has made, is the situation that may develop in magistrates' courts, where young offenders who have not had experience of non-custodial sentences should be taken out of society because they may be a danger to it. At least the hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) acknowledged that there were certain people who should be put into detention centres, or into borstal, because the nature of their offence was sufficiently serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Committee's attention to clause 1 (4)
<br><br><!-- lb -->
which states:
	<br><q><p>"unless it is of the opinion that no other method of dealing with him is appropriate."</p></q>
That says that a court, be it a magistrates' court or a higher court, cannot sentence a young man to a detention centre or a borstal, unless it is of the opinion that no other method of dealing with him is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand why Labour Members take exception to that, because it covers all the points that they were trying to make. The amendments that they are trying to press on the Minister are far too narrow. I suggest that the Minister should seriously consider whether to discuss them any further, or whether the Committee should reject them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Dubs 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Battersea, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made some comments about Labour Members not trusting the judges, and I assume that he meant the judiciary. I wonder whether that was a reasonable accusation to make against us. I refer him to some interesting statistics published by the DHSS in October 1981, in a publication called " Offending by Young People ". It details custodial sentences in relation to offences by 14-to-16-year-old boys, and makes a comparison between the number of detention centre and borstal sentences imposed in 1969 and those imposed in 1979. I fully accept the footnote, which says that the figures are not strictly comparable and that these are therefore rough calculations. Nevertheless, they will suffice to make the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1969, the number of DC and borstal sentences was 2,750. If the same proportion of offenders had received DC and borstal sentences in 1979, the figures would have gone up to 3,881. In fact, the number of DC and borstal sentences in 1979 was 6,876. In other words, as a result of the increased tendency of the judiciary to impose custodial sentences on these young people, an extra 3,000 or so young people actually received a custodial sentence in 1979 than if the practices that had been followed in 1969 by the judiciary had continued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This suggests that despite the enormous number of words that have been used by politicians, Ministers and others to ask the judiciary to be more reluctant to impose custodial sentences, the judiciary has not done so. There has been a large increase in such sentences. The report further goes on to say, I think this was quoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskir (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) a few moments ago:
	<br><q><p>"The number in juvenile detention centre and borstal has risen five-fold since 1965. Less than a fifth of the rise relates directly to increased offending. The remainder is caused by an increased tendency to give custodial sentences for almost all types of offence."</p></q>
It does not just mean offences of violence or sex offences, but " almost all types of offence". It continues:
	<br><q><p>"Numbers of juveniles in prison seem to have risen in some other countries, though no examples show the sustained increase of English borstal and detention centre sentences."</p></q>
In other words, on an international comparison we appear to be sending more young people into custody than other European countries, which I would have thought are suffering the same types of increase in their overall crime rate. So we have a judiciary that is keener to send young people into custody than before, certainly one that is keener to do so than other European countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that it is misleading to look at an increase in custodial sentences without taking into account the possibility that confidence in non-custodial alternatives may have diminished, for which there is some substantial evidence? Will he not accept, therefore, that there is much to be said for the proposals in the Bill to widen the range of the non-custodial sentences through the wider supervision order and the CSO available for 16-year-olds, for example?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that there is all to be said for the provisions in the Bill that increase the number of non-custodial sentences available. I was not aware that there had been an increasing lack of confidence in non-custodial sentences over the period in question. If this is the case, I wonder whether the Minister could give some evidence for it. It appears that the judiciary were simply sending more people into custody.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Indeed, I do agree, and I would have thought that that evidence goes counter to the point that the Minister appears to have been making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman not aware that considerable misgivings about the operation of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 led to the White Paper and the Bill? Since 1969 is the date which he has chosen for his base, is there not something to be drawn from that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have chosen as a base the precise date quoted in this document. I confine myself to quoting about detention centre and borstal sentences, not other methods by which people may end up in custody through care orders. There may be misgivings about that particular piece of legislation, but I would have thought the facts I have quoted, even though they are based on rough calculations, are incontrovertible and present us with an alarming description of what has been happening. It ought to pose a question in the minds of every hon. Member as to what we are doing when we send people into custody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not saying that there are not circumstances in which young people should go into custody. I am not condoning the offence of violence, or indeed any offences, but I do say that too many people are being put into custody for non-violent offences. Given the failure of custodial sentences, to which various hon. Members have referred, where the vast majority of young people re-offend—whether they have been to detention centre or borstal—it is up to us to think again about the purposes of custody and why custody is proving so singularly ineffective as a punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency in the borough of Wandsworth there is an excellent intermediate treatment scheme. Intermediate treatment is one of the things which is an indirect alternative to custody for young people. Many of the people who run intermediate treatment schemes are enlightened and seek to enable the young people who have been getting into trouble, or into difficulties, to become more responsible for their actions, to become more aware of the consequences of what they do, to improve the self-esteem or the self-regard of these young people in order to help them in society and to prevent them from re-offending. That That seems worth while and laudable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
hen a young person is put into custody he is put into a highly structured environment—a detention centre or borstal—where he makes virtually no decisions for himself during the period of his custody. I fully accept that in some borstals the training element
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0173">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
—the City and Guilds courses, and so on—may be very wort while, but the overall impression one gets is that the day is planned for the offender in borstal or detention centre from the moment he wakes until he goes to bed. That seems hardly the right environment in which to help young people develop the type of approach that will make them more responsible for the consequences of their actions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In intermediate treatment we have an attempt to make young people responsible for making their own decisions in life so that they can avoid getting into trouble. But if he gets into further trouble of a serious nature we take away from the young person any sense that he has to be responsible for his own actions while he is in custody. Therefore, it is not surprising that the day he walks out of the gate of a borstal or a detention centre he is all adrift, because nothing that has happened to him there—apart from the unpleasantness of being locked up—will help him come to terms with all the pressures and temptations of society. That is why I think that we protect society more from wrongdoers if we are more, rather than less, reluctant to put them into custody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Miss Richardson) said earlier when she quoted an example from her own constituency, custody is more likely to send people along the road to becoming criminals than it is to deter them from it. The recidivism rates tend to support that view, and we should look seriously at any possible proposals, including the amendment, which might reduce the number of people in custody. I believe that in that way society will find a better protection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My concern was eloquently expressed by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Grieve). It was that we should not entirely preclude the courts from giving sentences an element of which might be retributive or deterrent. There is a reference in the White Paper to an offender being a danger to the public which would actually preclude the courts from giving such a sentence. But neither the Bill, which speaks of methods of dealing with people which are appropriate, nor the various amendments, which speak of protecting the public, would preclude the courts from a deterrent or retributive penalty. For that reason I am open-minded as to whether the amendment put forward by the Opposition is accepted, or whether we stick with the Bill as it is, but I hope that we do not return to the phrase in the White Paper—"a danger to the public"— because I think that would preclude a deterrent or retributive punishment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman's difficulty about the retributive element in certain circumstances would be met if there were incorporated into the clause the same provision as in clause 2(6), which provides that in certain circumstances the court can depart from the general rule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know the answer to that question, but simply to say that in special circumstances one can depart from a general rule does not necessarily lay down the kind of guidelines that I expect magistrates would seek to have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to begin by saying that I regretted that the Minister got up when he did but, in the light of events, that may have been a good thing. His analysis of where we were on this issue indicates the nature of our disquiet. He is a member of an Administration who claim to want shorter sentencing. The Government have accepted the case that has been put forward consistently, not just from the Opposition but from a whole range of organisations—and not least the Home Office—that longer sentencing is unnecessary in order to curtail or affect the incidence of crime. For that reason, we have supported the Home Secretary in his campaign to persuade the judges to reduce the level of sentencing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are now to be accused of being hostile to the judges because we take the same line, surely we are in distinguished company when the Home Secretary has led that campaign. All that we seek to achieve in this series of amendments, and in our criticism of judicial policy of long sentencing, is to indicate that we must take a step that more simply enjoins the judiciary to take a more lenient view of the length of sentence that it has to pass in order to fulfil its judicial duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was for that reason that I had the altercation with the hon. and learned Minister for Solihull (Mr. Grieve) about burglary. Burglary, larceny and criminal damage account for 80 per cent, of indictable crime at present. If we are to make any impact on the degree of sentencing which has led to prison overcrowding, it is in this area that we have to talk about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman and other Conservative Members have consistently failed to accept that there must be shorter sentencing for burglary if any real impact is to be made upon the prison population.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vivian Bendall 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Ilford, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that if there were shorter sentences for burglary it might invite more violence into burglary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If if and buts were apples and nuts, anything might happen. Of course, it is possible. One can only say that the experience of other countries where shorter sentences have been tried— I have constantly repeated the experience of Holland because that is the best example—has indicated that shorter sentences do not lead to a greater incidence of crime. They do not necessarily cut the crime rate, but they do not lead to any great increase. Surely that is the message that ought to be getting across to the judiciary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who has sat on a judicial bench and had to give a sentence to a prisoner, as I have, knows that it is extremely difficult. It cannot be done by rules of rote. We all accept that. What the Opposition do not accept is that judicial experience at the moment necessarily leads to a correct understanding of the efficacy—I think that is the correct word but in view of the constant use of another term by the hon. Member for Croydon, North West (Mr. Pitt) I am not sure—of the punishment. Surely it must be right to say that if similar treatment of offenders elsewhere
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0174">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>73</span>
in the world has shown that shorter sentencing has not led to an increase in crime, and if one recognises that to reduce the prison population, sentencing has to be reduced, it ought to be possible to persuade the judiciary of that when applying its tariffs. So long as the judiciary sentences on the basis of time-honoured conventions about what is appropriate for a given crime at a given period in a criminal's life, this rigid round cannot be broken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seem to be only two alternatives, and both may be needed. We need to train our judiciary, both magistrates and judges, much better than we do at present. It is simply not true that a lifetime of advocacy is necessarily a prerequisite to understanding how to sentence. It is true that many people go on to the Bench without any understanding of what it means to send a man to borstal or to a long term of imprisonment. They do not know what the prisons are like and they do not know what borstal is like.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
