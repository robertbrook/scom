	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Kilroy-Silk 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ormskirk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time. This new clause would prohibit the remanding of school children to prisons and remand centres to await trial or sentence. This is a subject with which I have been involved since I first came to the House. Indeed, it was the discovery of the existence of several thousand school childen who were remanded to remand centres and adult prisons in 1974-75 that first brought me into the whole area of penal affairs and reform. I was very untutored and ignorant then, as I no doubt am now, in legal and penal matters and obviously extremely naive. I was horrified when in pursuing a constituency case of a burglar who was alleged to have been held on remand for nine months without trial—which I thought at the time would have been inconceivable—I discovered that it was not only true of that particular burglar but that he was one of many thousands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also discovered what was obviously not new to other people, that there were several thousand school children remanded every year into remand centres and adult prisons. It was that discovery which involved me in the path which leads me to being on this Committee today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, courts are empowered to remand juveniles to Prison Department establishments by virtue of section 23 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969. That particular section stipulates that when a court remands or commits a juvenile, if it is satisfied that he is of so unruly a character that he cannot be safely committed to the care of a local authority, then it shall commit him to a remand centre or, if no remand centre place is available, to a local prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1980, the last year for which figures are available, 3,372 juveniles—school children between the
	<span class='label label-info column'>628</span>
ages of 14 and 16—were remanded or committed to Prison Department establishments. Well over one quarter of these were subsequently found either not guilty or received a non-custodial sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an important point to note. It is not within the power of our courts to actually sentence a school child of 14 or 16-years-old to prison on conviction, but it is possible to remand them in custody in adult prisons while they are awaiting sentence or trial. It is an extraordinary state of affairs. Given the fact that something like a quarter of them are eventually found not guilty, or to have committed an offence that does not warrant a noncustodial sentence, it is highly offensive that they should have spent time, in effect, serving a prison sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The latest figures which are available relate to 31 December 1981, given in answer to a parliamentary question on Monday, and show that on 31 December there were 178 untried and unsentenced juveniles in prisons and remand centres, of whom 21 had first been remanded in custody between two and four months previously, a further nine more than four months earlier, one juvenile in a prison had been remanded in custody 233 days earlier and one juvenile in a remand centre had first been remanded in custody 189 days earlier. Those figures are not just a criticism of the fact that juveniles are actually spending time in custody in a remand centre or an adult prison, but also that on many occasions they spend very long periods of time in those adult prisons or remand centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not as if it is a matter of one or two days. The latest figures demonstrate that on many occasions it can be several months that children are being held in the highly inappropriate locations of remand centres and adult prisons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1975, the House of Commons Expenditure Committee chaired by the hon. Member for Plymouth, Drake (Miss Fookes) in its report on the Children and Young Persons Act said in paragraph 23:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We condemn in the stongest possible terms the use of certificates of unruliness as a means of achieving secure accommodation. We recommend that the practice of remanding young persons to adult prisons should cease forthwith; alternative arrangements must be made"</p></blockquote>
That was in 1975, when an all-party Committee of this House condemned in the strongest possible terms the use of certificates of unruliness, saying that the practice of remanding such children to adult prisons should cease worthwith and that alternative arrangements should be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In expressing that view at that time the Expenditure Committee was reflecting the views of most of those involved in working with juvenile offenders. Indeed, it is now universally accepted that those custodial remands are an indefensible scandal and that there is no necessity to remand a juvenile to an adult prison or to a remand centre. If secure conditions are regarded as necessary and desirable, they should be found in a secure place in a local authority community home, staffed by those specialising in work with children, rather than in a Prison Department establishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0486">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>629</span>
Not only are these children—and that is what they are called in the Act—being held in inappropriate locations where they should not be held, and it would be more sensibe to put them into local authority homes with specialist staff, but they are also being held in the worst of our Prison Department establishments
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a fact that remand centres and local prisons, which invariably will be the institutions that will house the juveniles, also happen to be the oldest of our prison service establishments, the ones where there is the most overcrowding and the most appalling physical conditions. To put children into those conditions is both a disgrace and a scandal Very often, because of the small numbers of juveniles detained, there will be only one or two in the local prisons. For example, on 31 December 1981, there was one 16-year-old boy alone in Canterbury prison, and one alone in Lincoln prison. As these juveniles are not allowed to mix, for very good reasons, with adult prisoners, it means that they are being contained alone without proper access to other peope, and without access to educational or training facilities because they do not exist for 16-year-olds in local adult prisons or remand centres. They are also, like the adult prisoners, being locked up for 23 hours out of every 24. That is an additional dimension that we must take into account. It is not just the fact that they should never have entered a remand centre or adult prison in the first place, it is also the compounding of the offence by the fact that the conditions in the particular institutions happen to be as deplorable as they are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Shirley Summerskill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend not agree that the offence has been compounded still further by clause 9 which makes specific requirement for the Home Secretary from time to time as he thinks fit deliberately to put women prisoners over 21 in to remand centres and youth custody centres which could contain 15-year-old girls?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I do. My hon. Friend will recall that I made exactly that kind of point when we were in Government and she was the Minister responsible for prisons—[HON. MEMBERS: " Oh ".] It is a fair point to make. At that time 40 to 50 16-year-old girls were being held on remand in Holloway prison. They were being allowed—and it was then Government policy to continue to allow them—to mix freely with adult female prisoners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, I think it was my hon. Friend who told me then, when I objected to this, that it was a good idea to allow the younger girls to mix with the older women because, in her words, the older women exercised a restraining influence on the younger girls. I found that offensive then. I find the proposition that the Government are advancing in clause 9 equally offensive, as does my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill). The whole situation with regard to juveniles in remand centres and adult prisons has been a disgrace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>630</span>
The Labour Government in the Children Act 1975 made provision for central Government grants to be made to local authorities for the purpose of providing secure accommodation. In that year, £2 million was made available and since then something like £9 million of central Government grants have been made to local authorities to enable them to provide secure accommodation in their local authority areas for juveniles who would otherwise be remanded to remand centres and adult prisons on a certificate of unruliness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, the power of the courts to remand children to prisons and remand centres has been increasingly restricted. The most important step on that again took place under the auspices of the previous Labour Government in 1977 when they introduced the Certificates of Unruly Character (Conditions) Order which severely restricted the circumstances in which courts were permitted—and still are permitted—to remand juveniles in custody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consequence of the implementation of that order on 1 August 1977 was an immediate, sharp drop in the number of juveniles remanded in custody. As a result of that order and of a series of orders introduced by the previous Labour Government, which ended the issuing of certificates of unruliness for girls, the number of juveniles remanded in custody fell from 4,812 in 1976 to 3,671 in 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present Government, to give them credit, have continued the process of phasing out the remands to custody by ending, first of all, the remand of 14-year-old boys to Prison Department establishments. That took effect in March 1981. I congratulated the Government then, and I reiterate that congratulation now, for having taken that small but important step. However it is still possible—and this is the point that we are debating today—to remand 15 and 16-year-old boys to prisons and remand centres, even though the present Government have clearly stated their intention of phasing out such remands when resources will allow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the report of the all-party Penal Affairs Group, " Young Offenders—A Strategy for the Future " we recommended in paragraph 294 that—
	<br><blockquote><p>"a specific timetable be announced for ending the remand of 15 and 16 year olds to prison department establishments and rapid progress should be made towards this objective."</p></blockquote>
A few months after our report was published, the DHSS report " Offending by Young People—A Survey of Recent Trends " was published in November 1981. This has been widely quoted in the Committee, particularly by the Opposition. It stated in paragraph 63 that—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the stock of secure places in the country as a whole is probably sufficient, or very nearly so, to accommodate in community homes all the boys at present remanded to prison department establishments."</p></blockquote>
If that is true—and it is the Government who say that, nobody else—there would seem to be no need for even one boy to be currently remanded in a Prison Department establishment. We have ended the remanding of girls and of boys of 14. There have not been the horrendous consequences that were forecast as a result of those measures, not least
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0487">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>631</span>
by Conservative Members and the Home Secretary's Parliamentary Private Secretary who, in a debate on the ending of remand of under 16-year-old girls' thought there would be terrible and terrifying consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of those consequences have actually borne fruit, and I suggest that the ending of remand now of 15 to 16-year-old boys would be equally as successful, particularly given the statement made in the " Offending by Young People " report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the number of secure places is very nearly sufficient to enable us to end this practice, the Minister can have no doubts as to when he will be able actually to introduce the intention of ending remand for 15 to 16-year-old boys. If the secure places already exist, or if there is only a small number required, presumably he will be able to tell us when they will be made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to think he would be able to accept the new clause today, not least because he is on record as supporting it. I do not suppose he remembers, but in a debate on the Bail Act, following my speech which he said he listened to with much admiration, the hon. and learned Gentleman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I join the hon. Gentleman "—</p></blockquote>
that is myself—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to the extent of underlining what he said about the evil"—</p></blockquote>
nice word—
	<br><blockquote><p>"of committing young people to prison. I am certain that we still underestimate, although we are much better at this matter than we were, the harmful effects upon young people of having at so impressionable an age that experience of prison life."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 26th May 1976; Vol 912, c. 528]</p></blockquote>
But that was not the only thing he said. A couple of years later, when we were debating the Children and Young Persons (Custodial Remands) Bill on a motion introduced by the hon. Member for Chisle-hurst (Mr. Sims), who is now sitting behind the Minister, the right hon. and learned Gentleman then said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"All of us in the rather sparsely attended Chamber are deeply interested in this problem and we agree that it is offensive for children and young people to be remanded into prison or to serve prison sentences." —[	<i>Official Report,</i> 23 November 1978; Vol 958, c. 1590]</p></blockquote>
There we have it. Those are the considered views of the Minister as long ago as 1976 and then, in a more considered frame of mind, in 1978. It is evil, he said, and offensive. If it is evil and offensive— it clearly is and I agree with and endorse what the Minister says—and if as the DHSS says it now has all the secure places available in the local authority homes system to take the boys currently on remand in Prison Department establishments, let us end the system now, once and for all, here today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of the new clause would be to repeal the provisions of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 which enabled a court dealing with an interim care order or with a juvenile charged with, or convicted of an offence, to commit
	<span class='label label-info column'>632</span>
to a Prison Department establishment a juvenile who is of so unruly a character that he cannot safely be committed to the care of a local authority. That is the important part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The law, under our arrangements, is that such juvenile offenders, or such juveniles who are yet to be tried do not qualify for bail or are not granted bail, are to be committed to the care of a local authority pending their trial or sentence if they are committed to the Crown court for borstal training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that the law should be that young people of this age should be in the care of a local authority pending the decision of the court as to what should be done with them. It is right for the reasons that I gave in the speeches which the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) has so flatteringly retained in the tablets of his mind, or perhaps more accurately, retained in the tablets of the 	<i>Official Report.</i> I do regard it as wrong that somebody of 15 should be in a prison which is appropriate for adults, whereas it is not appropriate, as successive Governments have recognised, for 15 and 16-year-olds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is surely not the whole of the issue. It is equally evil that a young person, albeit only 15, who is so tough—unruly, to use the slightly antique language of the statute—that he cannot safely be kept in the care of the local authority, should be able to get out and continue to commit offences that can be of the greatest danger and harm to other members of the community. It is not the whole of the issue to say that young people of this age ought not to be in prison. We can start from that point, and thankfully, our arrangements under successive Governments—as they will continue to be under the Bill—establish that the norm is that they do not go into prisons while they are awaiting trial or sentence. We have to ask ourselves whether, in present circumstances, they should never be able to be sent to prison. That is the remainder of the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suppose that, if we were to ask our con stituents to decide this question, they would be in much doubt as to where the right answer lay. The question would have to be along these lines. Let us start from the position that, unfortunately, a very small number of very tough young people cannot be kept with safety in a community home, even a secure community home, if one exists with available accommodation; and the opinion of the court, which has to be established on the basis of evidence and a certificate provided to it, is that they cannot safely be kept there and are likely to get out. The question then has to be put to our constituents whether our revulsion at the idea of a 15-year-old being kept for the time being in prison is so great that we must run the risk—that is, they, not we, must run the risk—of his getting out of the com munity home and again committing perhaps a violent offence. If that is a fair way of putting the question, as I hope and believe it is, I do not believe that anybody in this Committee would say " No ". But perhaps there is—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk),
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0488">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>633</span>
I have shared the dilemma of the Minister in seeking that no child should go to a prison establishment, and not having the resources to will that end. I can understand that dilemma. What I cannot understand is the method of argument he is now using. We are, I think, all agreed that we want to get children out of prison establishments on remand, and we want to put them into secure places. It was simply a question of willing the resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have learned this morning, which I had not realised before, that according to my hon. Friend and the document from the DHSS, those places are now available. They were not available in my time, and part of the procedure that we adopted in 1975 has willed those places. Surely the Minister is not arguing that we should not use those places, but should still send them to prison because they are bad boys.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is better than it was. Of course there is more secure accommodation, and very glad I am about it. But because over-all there may be very nearly enough secure accommodation to match the numbers of young people to whom we are referring, that does not mean that the accommodation is in the right place in every case. Everybody will recognise that it is important that somebody of this age group especially should not be detained in any accommodation that is a long way from his family and his home. If there is spare accommodation, let us say in Darlington, that does not really avail the court in Dorset, for example, that has to make an order of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is better, and I do not for one moment doubt that courts will prefer to use secure local authority accommodation where they can. Of course they will. Somebody who is of a degree of unruliness to make him unsafe to be detained in an ordinary community home may very well not be so unruly that he cannot safely be detained in secure accommodation. It is a question of where these places are and it is also a question of local authorities having the resources to employ sufficient staff to run the secure accommodation which has been built.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Presumably, if the Minister is now arguing that it would be wrong to take a 15 or 16-year-old boy from Darlington and put him in Dorset, or vice versa, he would also argue that it is wrong to take a girl of the same age—or younger—as currently happens, from Liverpool and put them in Bullwood Hall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly it has been acknowledged that a principal disadvantage of Bullwood Hall is its inaccessibility. I think I remember saying so when we discussed Bullwood Hall perhaps a month or two ago in this Committee. It is one of the disadvantages. If, and I believe it was dwelt upon by the hon. Gentleman and others, it is wrong that girls should be detained there, a long way away, let us not necessarily add to that defect in our arrangements by insisting that young people on remand should be kept a long way away from their homes
	<span class='label label-info column'>634</span>
and their families simply because there happens to be local authority accommodation there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not an all-black or an all-white issue. In fact, I do not believe that any of the issues with which we are dealing—or are to deal—can be described as being all-black or all-white. The new clause seeks to do something which we are already committed as a Government to trying to achieve. I was grateful to the hon. Gentleman that in his habitually fair way he acknowledged that we have made progress towards reducing the number of remands of juveniles in prison. We are, therefore, wholly in sympathy with the intention behind the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dulwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am impressed by the points the Minister has made and also by the statement he has just made that Government policy is to try to achieve in time, and subject to the expenditure of resources, what is embodied in this new clause. Why then can the new clause not be placed in the Bill? The Government do not have to bring it into operation immediately. They have ample time under clause 51 to appoint a commencement date some time in the future, but at least it would be an incentive, would it not, for steps to be taken to ensure that the minimum time possible would elapse before it became possible to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and learned Gentleman makes a perfectly proper point. The Government, I think, already have powers to ensure that committal to prison shall not take place for young people of this category. But it is not on the whole a very good thing, I believe, as a basis for legislation to place clauses into a Bill which will not take effect until some unspecified time in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You mean a partially-supervised sentence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly, a partially-supervised sentence placed upon the statute book in the circumstances in which my predecessor the hon. Member for Pontypridd (Mr. John), believed that there could be no likelihood of an increase in the prison sentence. He said as much in terms on Report. Therefore, he at that time did not envisage any ground for not bringing that clause into effect at the commencement of the Act as a whole.

That cannot be the case here because, as I have indicated, the accommodation at present is not available. I shall hear what the right hon. and learned Gentleman says and will not be dismissive in view of his strictures to me when we last met, but I think that it is a bad principle to, as it were, put things into the freezer in the statute book. I think it can lead to confusion and I believe we ought to legislate for what we can do, as a broad principle, at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend already has power under section 34 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 to make orders amending the remand provisions. That power was first exercised, as the hon. Member for Ormskirk has reminded us, last March, when 14-year-old boys were excluded from this provision.

	<span class='label label-info column'>635</span>
The accommodation was available and we felt that we were able to do it. It now applies only to boys aged 15 and 16. We are already looking to see what can be done about that age group. This new clause would make an abrupt change in an area where we need to move carefully and try to carry with us the confidence of the courts and the local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Juveniles have the same general right to bail as adults. The 15 and 16-year-old boys upon whom this debate focuses will have been refused bail because the courts have substantial grounds for believing that they would fail to surrender to custody, commit an offence while on bail or interfere with witnesses. There must be good reasons for the court to have refused them bail in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such cases, the provisions of section 23 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 is that they should be remanded to the care of the local authority, but in the case of the boys we are talking about, the courts will have certified as to their character that they cannot safely be committed to the care of a local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of certificates of unruliness has since 1977 been subject to very strict conditions. The boy must be charged with an offence punishable in the case of an adult with imprisonment for 14 years or more, or with an offence of violence, or have in his history a previous conviction for an offence of violence. In addition, a court must be satisfied on the basis of a written report from the local authority that no suitable accommodation is available for him in a community home where he could be accommodated without substantial risk, either to himself, or to others, or the court has to be persuaded that he has persistently absconded from, or has previously disrupted the running of, a community home. I think that those are fine gauge filters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are, therefore, boys charged with very serious offences for whom both the court and the local authority agree that a remand in care is not suitable. I do not think that we ought to approach this without taking into account the practical problems that confront the local authorities dealing, as Parliament has said they normally should, with boys of this kind of character.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since April 1981, about five-sixths of juveniles remanded to Prison Department custody have been held in remand centres, not in prisons. We cannot solve the problem of dealing with them by simply depriving the courts of their powers to remand in custody and depriving the local authorities of their power to apply to have a difficult boy remanded in custody. Each of them has a duty to ensure that the public is, where necessary, given some degree of protection and to ensure that the juvenile attends court for the trial or sentence in his case. We must work towards a solution which makes allowance for these duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our view has been made clear that there will always be a minority of juveniles for whom a custodial sentence is inevitable. In spite of that, we remain committed to a policy of trying to make sure that unconvicted or unsentenced juveniles are not
	<span class='label label-info column'>636</span>
held in custody. We took one step last March, which has been referred to today, ending the remand in custody of 14-year-old boys. Our next step will also have to be cautious, provided we can take it only when we are satisfied that proper alternative provision can be made and that these boys can safely be committed to the care of a local authority. We want to work towards that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been argued that remand in custody cannot be justified because many juveniles are eventually found not guilty or receive non-custodial sentences. It is easy enough to say that after the event, but the courts are here dealing with an essentially predictive decision. They do not know at the time of the remand that the ultimate result of the case will be a predictive decision about whether the offender will turn up for trial or sentence, or will get up to further trouble to himself or other people while on bail. The courts have to base their decisions on substantial grounds but they cannot be clairvoyant. They have to do the best they can on the facts available to them at the time, and it is no help to that process to point out that in the event things sometimes turn out otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope therefore that I have been able to show that our approach to this new clause is not different from, but is wholly consistent with, the approach which led us to release boys of 14 from liability to be remanded to prison, which we were able to do last March. Our approach is consistent but it has to take account of the practical considerations facing the courts, the most important of which is the consideration of safety. I therefore hope that the clause may be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) for his campaign, which he says he has waged since he came into the House, to get rid of the imprisonment of young children, especially when on remand. I know, because I had to meet the first onslaught of his wrath, that he has waged that campaign with successive Ministers, and I want him to understand that they all took the issue extremely seriously—I certainly did. It was my great desire, when we discussed this in the following Select Committee's report, to phase out completely the remand of children to prison establishments, but I found that that was quite impossible for older boys.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was very conscious of the possibility that it might be done for girls, and in time that has happened. The real difficulty about girls was that there were so few offenders that it was difficult to allocate the resources to provide secure places in community homes for that small number of girls. At the time when I was Minister we were actually sending them to Holloway from the whole of the South of England, or to Durham—I think it was— for the whole of the North of England. That was because there were so few that those were the only places to which we could send them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Happily we have now got rid of that situation but to get rid of it we had to allocate resources to make it possible to have somewhere outside a prison or a remand centre where girls could be sent whilst they were on remand. We all recognise that there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0490">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>637</span>
are some girls—and many more boys—who simply cannot be sent to a normal community home upon remand. We accept that such children exist. We may deplore it but they exist, and they are unsafe when they are on remand. I think that there are far fewer of them than the courts do, and one of the things that we tried to do was to reduce the number of unruly certificates, and I am glad to see that that has gradually happened over the years, and that unruly certificates have been ruled out for girls and the number for boys is greatly reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there will still be an irreducible minimum of both girls and boys who cannot be put into a normal community home. They have to have some kind of security. That is the obverse of the argument which my hon. Friend has put for so long, and with which we all agree, that it is wrong that children should be put in prison establishments. I agree with him and I am glad that successive Governments have managed to improve the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where I disagree with the Minister is that if we have now got to a stage—which I am bound to say I had not appreciated, where the number of places for boys in community homes is capable of absorbing all those who have to be remanded in secure conditions—then there is a case for my hon. Friend's amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, it is true that the places are not always as near to the places where they have lived as one would wish. However, when I first had to apply my mind to the problem, that position applied to girls throughout the country, but we still sent them to Holloway. Nobody suggested that we should send them not to Holloway but to a male prison in the area in which they lived. That suggestion would have been regarded as ridiculous. The girls had to go a long way away from their homes, which we felt was inevitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that we are in a dilemma. We must ask ourselves whether it is better to send a boy to a prison in his locality so that he can be easily visited by his relatives, or to send him to a place which is not a prison establishment, but where he will be kept in secure conditions, even though that means that his parents will have to travel further to visit him. Should that position continue until we can provide enough secure places in areas close to people's homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were faced with that dilemma, as distinct from the dilemma I had to face in 1975, I would prefer that the relatives travelled further. There are serious dangers about putting children into prison establishments, which must be weighed against the travelling difficulties of relatives. After all, if the child progresses in his criminal career to the point where he is put in Albany or some other secure accommodation, his relatives will have to travel a long way to visit him. If faced with only those alternatives, surely it is better to keep him out of a prison establishment and not simply say that his relatives will have a shorter journey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall certainly vote for the amendment. There is a good deal of weight in what my right hon. and
	<span class='label label-info column'>638</span>
learned Friend the Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) said about putting this provision on the statute book, even if we cannot implement it immediately. It is the irreducible minimum that should be put on the statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that we should not have provisions on statute books that cannot be implemented immediately, but he did not say that when we put his clause into the 1977 Act, which has not been implemented until today. It is only available to be implemented because it was included in the 1977 Act. We could do that in this case, and that puts on the pressure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious that, unless there is some pressure, we do not get any movement at all. We had real difficulty in 1975 in persuading the DHSS that it needed to move at all, and the DHSS is mainly responsible for the present difficulty. The Home Office has little power in the matter. The DHSS has to move. If this provision is there, and if there are constant calls for it to be implemented, the pressure is on the DHSS to provide the resources to ensure that it can be implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that one of the great difficulties in Government is to find time for legislation. All Governments have more legislation that they want to introduce than they can find time for. If we include provisions in the Bill it is possible, by order, to implement them overnight. But if we have to find time for further legislation, it is possible that we may not introduce the provisions for quite some time. Therefore, we should agree to this clause even if it cannot be implemented immediately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We live in a wonderfully hypocritical country. We say that we have a wonderful system of justice—an Act called the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 which states that we do not punish children, but actually treat them and care for them. We have a concept of welfare. We certainly do not, however, sentence children to prison when they are guilty, although we may put them in prison while they are still technically innocent, on remand, awaiting trial or awaiting sentence. This is a wonderfully hypocritical country when we can say that it is not sensible, not right, not proper, to send children to prison when they have been found guilty of an offence, but that it is all right as an administrative convenience—a backdoor method—to put them in prison for perhaps as long as several months when they are still technically and in practice innocent in nearly a quarter of the cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister says, the boys of 15 and 16 about whom we are talking, the residual but the largest number, can only be remanded to Prison Department establishments on the issue of a certificate of unruli-ness. That can only be issued by the court if the court is convinced that no secure places are available within the local authority home system. The Department of Social Security report " Offending by Young People", from which I quoted earlier, says some interesting things about the issue of certificates of unruliness. For example, paragraph
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0491">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>639</span>
65, which goes right to the heart of the Minister's main defence of the present position, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One might have expected that most unruly certificates would be made where the shortage of secure accommodation is greatest, since certificates are meant to be made only where a child is too unruly to be accommodated in a community home. Figure 20 "—</p></blockquote>
on page 65—
	<br><blockquote><p>"shows that this is not the case. For example, very few certificates were made in South Eastern Region where only one secure place was available in early 1981, while Yorkshire and Humberside, which had about the average provision of secure accommodation, made by far the most certificates."</p></blockquote>
It goes on at great length to show that there is no relationship between the issue of unruly certificates and whether there is space available in local authority community homes. It makes the point, by implication, that it is at the behest of the court, for a variety of other prejudices and bias, whether a male child will be remanded in a Prison Department establishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Lyon) was quite right when he said that in his time the issue was the difficult one of whether secure accommodation was available. He, like other Home Office Ministers, had to take stick for the failure of the Department of Health and Social Security—as with mentally disordered adult offenders—to provide proper facilities in the community. That failure leaves the prison Department and the Home Office with responsibility for these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now, however, we have evidence that the Department of Health and Social Security has actually delivered the goods, and provided the places. The Minister's response to that is to say that the secure places are not in the right place. I wonder where they are lacking. The Directory of Secure Accommodation, published in August 1980, which was kindly sent to me by Keith Jackson, the professional adviser to the South-West Children's Regional Planning Committee—is an annual catalogue of secure accommodation of the various categories existing throughout the country. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Directory lists what is, or will shortly be, available, and by adopting a uniform system of describing the secure accommodation, it is hoped that the Directory may be of assistance to local authority staff concerned, with the placement of those juveniles for whom a period of physically secure accommodation is considered absolutely necessary."</p></blockquote>
The DHSS report, "Offending by Young People: A Survey of Recent Trends", says that we now have all the accommodation countrywide which is available. We should have the Directory of Secure Accommodation listing accommodation, by type, location and number, so that each lccal authority with a difficult child who requires placement in secure accommodation can go through the list and place that child. That deals adequately, I would have thought, with the Minister's defence of the present present situation. The Minister resorts to saying that we do not want to move a child from one part of the country to another when every day he defends the practice of boys going to detention centres and for girls going to borstal. It is absurd to suggest that it is more desirable to put a young
	<span class='label label-info column'>640</span>
boy of 15 into an over-crowded prison like Liverpool or Brixton, to leek him up there in isolation for 23 hours out of every 24, to give him no education and no training, than it is to house him a little further away from home but in appropriately designed accommodation where he will receive professional help and training. If the Minister wishes to sustain that argument, there is no case at all for the continued existence of the two DHSS sponsored youth treatment centres which take all children who are committed under section 53 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. One is Glenthorne in Birmingham and the other St. Charles in Brentwood which operates not only for England and Wales, but take children from Scotland. Does the Minister say that is wrong, that there should be no 10-year-olds at Glenthorne, but that they should be back in Scotland near their parents? If he is not prepared to say that about youth treatment centres—and I would respect his arguments for not wishing to say it— he cannot fairly advance the argument as he has today in relation to boys who are in remand centres, which are adult prisons, who do not need to be there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a long saga and it will be longer unless we settle the matter today. Many of my hon. Friends have been discussing the issue for longer than I. They were campaigning for the end of such remands long before I came to the House. I believe, like the Minister when he was in Opposition, that it is an evil and offensive practice. It is also unnecessary. If we accept—and the Government do—that it is wrong in principle to put children in prison when they are guilty it is also wrong when they are innocent. The Government say that they want to end such remands. They have the opportunity here today. If we say it is wrong in principle we should end it. If we close up the road we shall find, as we did with 14 and 16-year old girls and we have already done with 14-year olds boys, that they can all be just as easily and sensibly located within the local authority home system without any danger to the public and without difficulties for the prison service or the local authorities. I urge my hon. Friends to join me in voting for the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>PROHIBITION OF IMPRISONMENT OF DRUNKENNESS OFFENDERS FOR FINE DEFAULT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause would make the offences of sleeping rough and begging non-imprison-able. This, as hon. Members of the Committee will know, was a recommendation of the Parliamentary all-party penal affairs group in its report " Too Many Prisoners " published in 1980. It was also a recommendation of the all-party Home Affairs Select Committee in its report "Vagrancy Offences " published last year which stated in paragraph 26:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are convinced that imprisonment is neither a necessary nor an appropriate penalty for minor offences of this type. Though we accept that the criminal law must continue to play a limited role in controlling the activities of beggars and vagrants, we consider that it is quite wrong that they should be faced with even the theoretical possibility of imprisonment on these grounds alone, and we therefore recommend that both sleeping rough and begging should cease to be imprisonable offences "</p></blockquote>
A minority of the Select Committee members, myself included, favoured going much further than that and repealing what were regarded by a minority of the Select Committee as Dickensian offences which punish and label as criminals people with fundamental problems of poverty and homelessness. It seemed to us and to those who signed the minority report that the real solution for these people, who are not criminals, have no criminal intent or propensity, and are very often extremely vulnerable, inarticulate and disadvantaged members of the community was to try to deal with their needs within the community rather than to publish their inadequacies by a period of imprisonment. That was certainly the view of the majority, but it was not
	<span class='label label-info column'>642</span>
the view of the majority that all penalties for begging and sleeping rough should be abolished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are four main reasons why these offences, for which in 1980 150 people were sentenced to immediate terms of imprisonment, should be made non-imprisonable. The first is the effect that it may have on the prison population. Not a significant number are involved, though some of them with their difficulties pose disproportionate problems for prison staff. Any reduction in the prison population, however marginal, is to be welcomed. I have the Home Secretary's support for that. In a speech on 21 March 1980 to, of all people, the Conservative Central Council, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We shall need … to see that the prisons are not allowed to remain cluttered up with trivial and inadequate offenders who are no real threat to anyone, except possibly themselves, but whose presence helps to create the extremely acute pressures which afflict our prisons today and all who work in them."</p></blockquote>
I endorse what the Home Secretary said then and he will, no doubt, endorse the desire to end the imprisonment of beggars and vagrants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the minor degree of annoyance that is caused to the public by sleeping rough and by begging is not sufficiently serious and certainly not dangerous enough to warrant a draconian punishment. The offences in the Vagrancy Act are designed to protect the public from minor forms of nuisance, embarrassment or annoyance, rather than to protect the public from substantial harm, damage or danger. If members of the public are annoyed or embarrassed it should be incumbent upon them to be prepared, as in the case of soliciting by prostitutes, to appear in court and testify that they were personally annoyed, offended, disturbed, or whatever by the defendant's behaviour. I am saying that such offenders should be caught by the ordinary law that covers the rest of us if we annoy or offend our fellow citizens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, I believe that imprisonment is not, and cannot be, a deterrent, and cannot have any real deterrent value for vagrants. Anyone who is not already deterred by the extreme discomfort of the way of life of a vagrant will not be deterred by the threat of a period in prison. Indeed it is well known—and sometimes this is advanced in support of the retention of the penalty of imprisonment— that many vagrants actually welcome a period in prison as a short respite from the rigours and hardship of life outside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that that is the case, but I do not accept that as a reasonable argument for continuing the penalty of imprisonment. It is, I think, a sorry commentary on an allegedly compassionate society that the only way in which we can respond to the homelessness and the social and personal inadequacy of many of our fellow citizens is to resort to imprisoning them in the overcrowded and deplorable conditions of our local prisons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth and most important reason why imprisonment should be ended is that vagrancy is a social problem and it requires social solutions, which imprisonment does nothing to provide. Indeed,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0493">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>643</span>
putting vagrants into prison distracts attention away from the real problems of those individuals and of the community as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that some people who accept that imprisonment is an unjustifiably severe punishment for these offences nevertheless defend the use of imprisonment for vagrants on welfare grounds. For example, the Metropolitan Police in evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee last year said that while from a punitive standpoint imprisonment was clearly too severe a sentence for sleeping rough, it nevertheless provided shelter, food, medical attention and access to the Welfare State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the intention and the sympathy behind that argument but the fallacy of that well-intentioned argument has been made clear by the findings of the Home Office in its recent research study: "Persistent Petty Offenders" published in 1980, which stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Experience of the criminal justice system invariably serves to consolidate the original disadvantage, since it is more difficult to find accommodation or employment or to re-establish contact with family and friends after a prison sentence than before."</p></blockquote>
So although the Police Federation and many other well-intentioned people have advanced arguments in favour of prison saying that perhaps we should leave things as they are because vagrants get treated rather well in prison—and I understand the motives behind that argument—the research conducted by the Home Office suggests that any benefits that might accrue from a short period of imprisonment are far outweighed by the more difficult process of trying to adjust back to society after a period in prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real need—and I think anybody who has studied the problem would acknowledge this—is not to keep going through the whole vicious circular process of picking these people up in the streets, detaining them in police cells, making them appear in court, putting them in prison for a short period, releasing them back on to the streets, and starting the whole process up again; it is to provide a range of community-based alternatives and facilities for vagrants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, we need a range of small hostels or other accommodation for single homeless people. There needs to be a variety of styles of hostel, providing different degress of social support. I do not think that many people actually sleep rough by choice; they do so either because they cannot find accommodation because there may be no accommodation available locally, or in many cases because they have been blacklisted by some of the hostels. A recent television programme seemed to indicate that the Salvation Army does this for bed-wetting, for example, so vagrants now tend to be blacklisted by hostels that were set up precisely to deal in a voluntary way with their problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They may not be able to find accommodation because they themselves regard the accommodation offered as unacceptable. It is known that many of the older men, probably alcoholics and currently homeless and vagrants who live on the streets of London do so by choice because they are not prepared to accept the perhaps punitive discipline that
	<span class='label label-info column'>644</span>
is imposed by some of the hostels that exist to cater for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much in sympathy with what the hon. Gentleman says and will certainly support his new clause, but I am just a little concerned about his call for further provision for the homeless because, as he will know, much of this provision is already given by the charities, by churches—he has mentioned the Salvation Army— and so on. Is there not just a slight danger that if we push this one too far, if we do provide too many homes for these sort of people, they may be encouraged to carry on their particular way of life and those numbers that he talked about may increase because such provision exists?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there is any validity in the hon. Gentleman's argument. He is assuming, perhaps not intentionally, that people take up this way of life and make themselves homeless and remain homeless by choice or intent. I do not believe that is the case. If they do, I do not believe that they will be deterred by the threat of a prison sentence. I do not think any of the individuals we are talking about are susceptible to that kind of deterrent. They are homeless for a variety of reasons. Of course, now we have the evidence of the DOE report of a different type of homeless person— more middle-aged, more middle-class and younger than previously. That is a different problem which we have to deal with in a different way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, I am talking about the traditional vagrant who sleeps rough, who is very often mentally unstable, alcoholic, socially inadequate, has a whole variety of social, physical and emotional problems and who will not in any way be deterred from his way of life, from sleeping rough or from begging by the potential threat of a prison sentence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with what the hon. Gentleman says, but surely he must not exclude completely the very real comparison that exists with some people who now, because of the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act, actually make themselves homeless to force themselves upon a local authority so that the local authority will provide them with a home.

There may just be a small element in this. I agree that it is a minor element, but I do not think we want to go too far down the road of providing too many places for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Vivian Kendall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ilford, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following what my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, West (Mr. Carlisle) was saying, when we were talking about imprisonment for possession of cannabis we were also talking about the increase in alcoholism that is taking place. If that rise continues we are likely possibly to have more people sleeping rough and, therefore, able to take advantage of the sort of situation that my hon. Friend was describing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the point of the hon. Member for Luton, West (Mr. Carlisle). We all know from our experience in our own constituencies that some of the provisions of the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act require that people deliberately
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0494">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>645</span>
make themselves homeless and local authorities, we know, conspire to ensure that a landlord evicts a tenant so that that tenant can then have priority in obtaining a house or council accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that goes on, but that is not the same thing that we are talking about. It is not people deliberately making themselves homeless and sleeping on the streets. One will not find the sort of family that the hon. Gentleman and I are talking about, members of our constituencies, who are made homeless in order the very next day, without there being any transition on the streets, to obtain council accommodation. They will not be sleeping on the streets, and if for one reason or another they have to sleep on the streets, they will not be deterred from doing so by the threat of imprisonment. They have nowhere alse to go, and surely the hon. Members for Luton, West, and Ilford, North, would accept that it is wrong to impose such a harsh sanction on somebody whose only offence is to be homeless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither hon. Gentleman, surely, is suggesting that we had better be a bit careful about removing this penalty and providing the accommodation that is, and will be, necessary because people will actually take advantage of it. We want them to. Surely, we all want those people off the streets if they are annoying or embarrassing other people. For those reasons alone we want them off the streets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought in common humanity anyway we should want to get them off the streets and into hostels, flats, housing, or whatever it happens to be. We need a range of other facilities to be established. We need more accommodation of a wide, varying type for single homeless, and more facilities in terms of day-care centres and drop-in places for advice, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need, in fact, a new strategy on behalf of the Department of Health and Social Security, not so much the Home Office, for the provision of both accommodation and appropriate support services for single homeless people. We certainly do not need —I should not have thought there could be any conceivable argument in favour of it—a perpetuation of the imposition of penal sanctions on people who are often some of the most disadvantaged, deprived, inarticulate, and under-privileged of our fellow-citizens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They cannot speak for themselves, do not write to Members of Parliament, never lobby Westminster, have no powerful pressure group campaigning on their behalf, and no major trade union in support of their claims, but they have a right to be treated properly and justly. They are not being treated in that way at the moment. The new clause will be one very small but important step in a move towards a more compassionate treatment of some of our most unfortunate fellow-citizens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>646</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to support the new clause moved by the hon. Member for Orms-kirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk). He has probably covered most of the points that many of us would wish to raise, so that my intervention will be brief. There is no doubt that we all feel that it is a sorry sight to see the vagrants about the streets of London,, and particularly not far from this place, under the arches of Charing Cross station. It always reminds me, and doubtless several others, of my own good fortune in having a roof over my head and a reasonable remuneration for what I am attempting to do here, to see others in rather less fortunate circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that because some of them have fallen on hard times, and certainly seem content to live their lives in a very different way from others in society, they should not be punished for doing so. As the hon. Gentleman said, not many actually choose to become vagrants and tramps, as they do become, but at the same time we in society have a certain duty to give them the respeot for their way of life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am fortunate to live in the country, where we occasionally see rural tramps, a sector which the hon. Member for Ormskirk did not mention. I suggest that they are a very attractive part of the rural scene. They are will received, and in some cases very well looked after by those of us who are fortunate enough to live in those areas. It would be a sad sight to see them either hounded out of existence by any sort of police harassment, and certainly so if society decided that they should be rounded up and put behind bars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must, however, accept that they can indeed cause some annoyance, particularly when they are begging. We are perhaps fortunate in this country that we do not see our own vagrants begging as much as they do in many other countries, in particular the poorer countries of the world. This is why we must be extremely careful not to remove any form of penalty for begging by annoyance, in any new clause that we move today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should pay tribute to the charities, and particularly to the churches, for the work that they do. I do not entirely agree with the hon. Member for Ormskirk that because such people choose this way of life it should necessarily immediately be assumed that the Department of Health and Social Security could take entire responsibility for them. The charities are doing a magnificent job in helping these people, particularly at times like Christmas, when the rest of the nation is enjoying itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should certainly support the charities, and should certainly as a Government support any means of finance that we can towards them. I would rather see any help directed in that way rather than the provision of further homes provided by a local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must repeat the warning that we must at all times be extremely careful that we do not provide, because of homelessness, any encouragement to those
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0495">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>647</span>
who might deliberately seek to throw themselves on the mercy of a local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Ormskirk rightly says, most hon. Members have experience of constituents who deliberately put themselves at the mercy of a local authority under the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977—landlords who deliberately turn people out of homes because they know full well that there is a statutory requirement for the local authority to put a roof over their heads within 24 hours. I do not think that we are going down that road, or that the new clause would encourage it, but it is something we must be careful about in framing any new legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I certainly welcome the new clause, and I welcome the very reasonable way in which the hon. Gentleman set it out. I am sure that he will receive the support, not only of many Members, but of many members of the public as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I speak on new clause 50, which I tabled with my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson), and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dul-wich (Mr. Silkin). I see it as really a separate issue in many ways from the new clause moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk), although we are discussing them together. Vagrants are not necessarily drunks, and drunks are not necessarily vagrants, and I like to think that they are two separate categories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can think of no better way to start than to quote in my support the Home Secretary, who said, to delegates of the Conservative Central Council at Bournemouth, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it was no use continuing to overburden staff, too often working in antiquated and inadequate buildings,"—</p></blockquote>
this is prison staff—
	<br><blockquote><p>"with petty offenders such as persistent drunks who could not pay their fines and could be dealt with just as well in other ways."</p></blockquote>
I am pleased to have the wholehearted support of the Home Secretary in my new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could leave it there, so far as the Minister is concerned, but if people are not persuaded by the Home Secretary's support, I will endorse what he says with the facts of the case as it relates to offences of drunkenness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are trying to increase the number of non-custodial offences—that is, offences for which we consider that prison is not the appropriate sentence to impose. We have discussed the new clause just moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk. We have had one on soliciting, and another on cannabis users. This falls into a similar category. The last prison population figure, on 26 February, was 43,764, and the Home Secretary himself has said that this could rise to 46,000 by the spring. The financial provision in the Budget White Paper allows for an increase in expenditure on prisons to permit an increase to 46,000 in the next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>648</span>
More and more informed opinion is expressing the view that we should take drunkenness not simply out of prison but out of the criminal justice system as a whole, but the new clause tabled by myself and my hon. Friends simply says " Let us take it out of prison ". Such people used to be committed direct to prison; now they arrive in prison as a result of nonpayment of fines. No doubt the Minister will give us the exact number in prison at the moment. Perhaps his advisers could send him notes and he could send them back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, 10 to 15 per cent, of the population in Pentonville are recurrent drunks. In a crowded prison, which I believe Pentonville to be and to be increasingly crowded, for 10 to 15 per cent, of the population to be recurrent drunks seems the height of folly as these people are regarded—to use a social worker's expression—as social deviants. They have not committed crimes of violence. They are no real danger to the community and it has been shown that putting them into prison is no deterrent to their habit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no evidence that they respond to imprisonment. It may be that a short spell there dries them out in the short term, but it does not deal with the long term problem which afflicts these people. Invariably they begin drinking again as soon as they have been dried out in prison. It does not seem to me that our prison places, which are so precious, should be used to dry out drunks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A distinction must be drawn between new clauses 23 and 50 because drunkeness is of nuisance and offence to many other people and part of the problem with those who suffer and become too intoxicated is that they make themselves thoroughly unpleasant in the presence of other people. With vagrants, who are sleeping rough and probably in their own world looking after themselves, it is a different category. I would be a little concerned if the hon. Lady felt that imprisonment was not in some way a form of punishment to these people for consistently making a nuisance to themselves and to the general public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that they are a nuisance. What I will show is that the remedy is not to put them in prison and I will come to the alternative to prison in a minute. Evidence has shown that it does not stop them being a nuisance again when they get out and one cannot keep them permanently. It is, as I say, a short-term remedy but it does not stop them being a nuisance again, and in the meantime one has taken up a precious prison place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come to the alternative. The evidence shows—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For a moment I was confused and had to look at the terms of the new clause. My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) has indicated that a sentence of immediate imprisonment for being drunk and disorderly has already been ended. What my hon. Friend is now proposing is that one should go a step further and end imprisoment for default of payment of a fine for being drunk and disorderly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0496">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>649</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I explained that at the beginning. As long ago as 1898 people were talking about this problem and a committee of inquiry was set up then which concluded that fines and short terms of imprisonment had no effect upon habitual drunkards. I am sure that things have not changed and we must devise a method of containment and care which takes these people out of prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Drunkenness has been described as a disease, but that is perhaps only one description. There are often social and economic factors which are the background of this habit, but it is clear that whatever the causes—and there will be a long discussion on that—these people need some sort of treatment apart from simply being put in prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The suggestions have been detoxification centres and special hostels. In 1971, the detoxification centres were given to the Department of Health and Social Security as their responsibility. In other words, it was accepted by the Home Office and the Government in general that this was more a health and social problem than a criminal one. Two experimental detoxification centres have been set up in Leeds and Manchester. The Leeds one serves my constituency and there is no doubt that people who find that this helps them go there from far and wide. You can see the drunks going there for help every night and going there for a free meal and possibly a bed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Home Office, on the other hand, has not given all responsibility to the DHSS, and that is what is so unsatisfactory. The Home Office is financing two experimental shelters. They are called " wet shelters ". That is an unfortunate term in view of the Conservative Party's current circumstances. However, they are called experimental wet shelters and they provide overnight accommodation for those who would otherwise be charged with drunken offences. The police can take drunken offenders to these facilities, either the detoxification centres or the wet shelters, instead of charging them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady were sitting on the Conservative Benches her speech could be described as being reasonably wet. What worries me about the description she has given is that she is almost beginning to make this disease, as she called it, of drunkeness almost attractive, suggesting that society must take the responsibility for putting it right. Does she not agree that a large amount of drunkeness arises mostly from the lack of self-discipline, and that therefore some punishment or deterrent must be available to the courts in such circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The evidence has shown that it does not deter, that so often the same people return to prison. If the Minister can show that the numbers of drunkenness offenders in prison has been going down gradually over the years and is almost negligible, or if he can show that there is no recidivism, I shall be very interested to hear it. However, I believe that this condition must be treated in some other way. The Government in
	<span class='label label-info column'>650</span>
the past have recognised this and so have the present Government. This division of responsibility of the wet shelters under the Home Office, albeit experimental, and the detoxification centres under the Department of Health and Social Security shows a schizophrenic attitude towards drunkenness. I know that I shall be reminded that the Labour Government tolerated it, but I would like us to take advantage of a Criminal Justice Bill, which does not often come along very often in one's Parliamentary life, to take these people out of prison once and for all and see that even the fine-defaulting drunks do not end up in prison.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has quoted the authority of some Ministers whom some described as being wet in support of her view, but nobody could surely be drier than Mr. James Jardine the chairman of the Police Federation who said in terms to the Home Office Select Committee:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We would regard it"—</p></blockquote>
that is the police—
	<br><blockquote><p>"as a positive step if some greater urgency could now be given to the decriminalisation of simple drunkenness and to the provision of more medically based detoxification centres "</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that my hon. and learned Friend is a great expert on alcohol and I look forward to his contribution to this subject because he has a great deal of knowledge on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that many people want to decriminalise drunkenness. The amendment does not go quite as far as that; no doubt, we could reach that point. I am simply saying that we should make this sentence non-custodial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a pity that the Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security is not here for this subject because it obviously relates very much to his Department and always has over the years. On 23 December 1981, he said that the pilot centres in Leeds and Manchester, which were funded by the Department for limited experimental periods are now being supported locally and:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A decision on policy on detoxification centres will follow the completion of an evaluation research programme commissioned by the Department, and the results of which will be available in the latter half of 1982."— [	<i>Official Report,</i> 23 December 1981; Vol. 15, c. 425.]</p></blockquote>
But, in spite of a firm statement by its own advisory committee on alcoholism, the DHSS seems to be saying that it will not continue with detoxification centres unless it has some very firm evidence that it should do so. I am not quite sure what the firm evidence is that they are looking for. It seems to me, from all the evidence, that this should be entirely the responsibility of the DHSS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wet centres that the Home Office has set up are also, as far as I can understand, only an experiment. So, we have a split in the responsibility, a sort of buck-passing, with neither Department really taking charge of the problem nor being really sure that what they are doing is the right way of dealing with the problem. Both the wet centres and the detoxification centres are still an experiment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>651</span>
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On grounds of cost alone, I would have thought that it would have paid the Home Office to take these people out of prison. Very often it is the same people going to court each time, the same people taking up a prison place. Admittedly, residence in a detoxification centre has been estimated to be about £200 a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two points here. First, the prison department would not be paying for that. The DHSS would be incurring the cost. Secondly, at least that would be trying to tackle the long-term problem of drunkenness. By putting such people in detoxification centres they are being offered some treatment for their condition, rather than just the short-term approach of putting them in prison. The long-term effect of putting them all into the centres would surely reduce the prison population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to the Minister that he is probably having the same problem with the DHSS on this matter as was encountered with that Department under the previous Labour Government, by which the DHSS is saying that it will not accept the responsibility. If the Committee today decided to pass the new clause, it would relieve the Minister of the onus of saying that the Government will try to do what they can, but there are only two detoxification centres and the DHSS is reluctant to set up any more because it is still an experiment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pressure would then be upon the DHSS to accept this responsibility because with the support of the Home Secretary who has said that he wants these people out of prison, and with the support of the Committee, the Minister would then be able to say that it is up to the DHSS to deal with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been no fewer than five reports emphasising what I have been saying. There is the report of the Home Office working party on habitual drunken offenders of 1971. This report recommended the establishment of a range of hostels and other services for habitual drunken offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was the report of the DHSS advisory council on alcoholism on " The Pattern and Range of Services for Problem Drinkers " in 1978. This recommended the development of
	<br><blockquote><p>"desirable alternatives to the dismal processes of arrest, court appearance, fine and prison for drink offences".</p></blockquote>
I know that we are dealing now with the fine defaulters among those people, but they are the same people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A report of the House of Commons Expenditure Committee on "The Reduction of Pressure on the Prison System " in 1978 recognised
	<br><blockquote><p>"the futility of imprisoning large numbers of offenders for offences in connection with drunkenness".</p></blockquote>
There was the report of the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee on " Deaths in Police Custody " which came to the same conclusion—that we must take habitual drunkards out of prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, though presumably there are many more that could be quoted, there is the report of the parliamentary all-party penal affairs group, "Too Many Prisoners". My right hon. and learned Friend the
	<span class='label label-info column'>652</span>
Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) has already quoted part of that, and no doubt he will quote a lot more of it when he speaks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the work and research that have been done have led to the same conclusion, and here we have a perfect opportunity to remedy the situation, which Parliament may not have again for many years. We have an opportunity to make any offence connected with drunkenness—especially not paying the fine—a non-custodial offence. I hope that I have persuaded the Minister and the Committee that new clause 50 should be incorporated in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak more to new clause 23 than to new clause 50. I rise with my determination to support the new clause shaken, though not altogther removed, by the Opposition's arguments in its favour. The hon. Member for Orms-kirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) always succeeds in thinking of arguments for proposals that I supported which makes me wonder whether I really supported them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall start with the argument about the overcrowding of prisons and the need to reduce the prison population. It has been said so often in the Committee that it has become boring, but I shall say once more that in my opinion, and in the opinion of many of my hon. Friends, the overcrowding of prisons is an argument for building more prisons. Overcrowding of prisons is not, and can never be, an argument for decriminalising something that we think to be criminal, or for mitigating something that we think to be the proper punishment for some offence. I do not accept that the overcrowding of prisons is an argument, in this or in any other case, for reducing sentences. If a sentence is reduced, it must be reduced because there are humane arguments, which stand in their own right, for so doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Member for Ormskirk mentioned with sympathy, though not in the end with approval, the argument that imprisonment may be useful for vagrancy and for sleeping rough, because it gets people some sort of automatic access to the Welfare State. " Automatic " is a euphemism, the word should be compulsory access to the Welfare State. I deeply resent the idea that the criminal law, and our criminal courts, should be used as a means for enforcing treatment upon people who might voluntarily have sought treatment but who have decided of their own free will not to do so. It may be, as he said, that these arguments are put forward by well-intentioned people. They are well inten-tioned, but the arguments are to me deeply offensive, and in accepting those arguments we would start out on a dangerous jurisprudential road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He also said that vagrancy and sleeping rough should be seen as social problems. They are social problems; all forms of crime are social problems. But the criminal law exists to deal not with social problems but with the aspects of nuisance or the aspects of sinfulness which may arise as concomitants to social problems. So the question before us is not whether this is a social problem, as it certainly is, but whether there is some sort of criminal concomitant to it which demands the sort of punishment that we have been giving.

	<span class='label label-info column'>653</span>
The hon. Gentleman managed to make what I hope was not a dig at the Salvation Army in his speech. The Salvation Army, in my opinion and in my experience, does an excellent job in helping to care for many of these people. The fact that it does not feel able sometimes to treat the most serious of the vagrants who come before it reflects more the sort of treatment that it is able to give rather than that it is unsympathetic. It cannot treat the less serious cases properly if its treatment and discipline are being spoilt by the more serious cases. I hope nobody would dissent from the proposition that the Salvation Army does an excellent job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He and the hon. Lady constantly spoke as though these problems were caused by some lack of facilities available to people. Indeed, members of the Labour Party would be antipathetic, I suppose, to any view that problems of this kind can be caused by anything other than the failure to satisfy some material appetite, the failure to provide some sort of facilities for people. But many of these problems seem to me to be caused by spiritual needs, and I use " spiritual" not in a strictly religious sense but as a much broader term than that. The provision of facilities that are already available may well not be the answer to the needs that led to these crimes. My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, West (Mr. Carlisle) mentioned his fears that drunkenness can result in threats to society at large which really are far different and far more serious than the threats caused by vagrancy or sleeping rough. That is right, but I would remind him that there are other crimes which a man who is drunk may commit, for which other laws and other penalties are available. For many of those imprisonment is already one of the punishments which can be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One approaches this on the three counts on which I approached the question of soliciting for the purposes of prostitution. Punishment may have a retributive, a deterrent and a reforming element. It is perfectly clear—and it has been clear for many years —that retribution is not appropriate in the case of vagrancy or sleeping rough. It is also perfectly clear that these people are not deterred by this form of punishment, and it is equally clear that prison is not a suitable way of reforming them and that it will fail to reform them. This change in the law therefore seems to me obvious and sensible. I cannot imagine why it has not been made before. It takes a Conservative Government to get reforms like these through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I propose also to be brief despite the incitement of my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill). I am delighted that we have at last heard, if I may say so without appearing to be patronising, some intelligent contributions from Conservative Members—I except, of course, the Minister, whose contributions are always intelligent, whether or not they are always right— and I entirely agree with the substance of the two contributions we have had. I agree particularly with the last few remarks of the hon. Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris) who said in relation to these people who are referred to in the Vagrancy
	<span class='label label-info column'>654</span>
Acts and in the new clause that prison does not serve any of the purposes for which it is intended or for which different people think it is intended—either deterrent or reformative. It is clear that that is the position. I would hope that the hon. Member would have accepted that the same is true in the case of certainly the person who is habitually drunk and cannot rid himself of the habit of dunkenness. Indeed, in many cases the people we are dealing with under new clause 50 are the same people as those we are dealing with under new clause 23. And what we are dealing with in new clause 23 are often merely the symptoms of people who are being dealt with in new clause 50.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am speaking now not necessarily on behalf of all Opposition members of the Committee any more than the hon. Member for Derbyshire, West speaks on behalf of all members of his party, but on behalf of all those of every party who took part in the discussions on and who approved the report of the parliamentary all-party penal affairs group, including some very experienced and distinguished Conservative members. Our approach certainly went beyond the approach that he put forward. I think it right to place our approach on record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our approach, as we said in paragraph 194, at the conclusion of our report is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to reserve custody … to those who would represent a real danger to society. For those whose freedom would represent no more than a nuisance, we propose both new methods and the greater use of tried and established noncustodial methods of disposal."</p></blockquote>

Although we carry the principle through to its logical conclusion, not necessarily at a stroke, but as a policy which we would hope to see implemented in legislation, nonetheless the view that we expressed here is one which has been accepted by Governments of all parties, and the problem has been rather the speed of implementation, of the giving effect to that principle, rather than disagreement with the principle itself. I hope that nothing that we have heard from the the hon. Members for Luton, West (Mr. Carlisle) and Derbyshire, West, particularly with reference to the importance of penalising nuisance, suggests that they really differ fundamentally from the principle that we have there put forward. What they are saying, I should have thought, is almost trite in terms of penal thinking today, because so far, at any rate, there has been general agreement on new clause 232. Let me not be tempted to develop that further, but let me just say a few words on new clause 50.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It proposes to remove the sanction of imprisonment for those who, having been convicted of drunkenness, are fined in the first instance. For my part, I was disappointed that the provisions of the 1967 Act did not go a great deal further than they do, in that they dealt only with a very limited class of drunkenness offence. I have been vastly more disappointed, however, that in the time that has elapsed since 1967, when Governments of both parties have had ample opportunities—this is not a party point in any sense—to go beyond mere experimentation and to set up a system which gives
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0499">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>655</span>
full effect to the principles behind the section in the 1967 Act and the debates which we had at the time, our progress has been so lamentably slow. Progress has been not only lamentably slow but divided in concept, and certainly not in any sense giving effect to the real intention of Parliament at that time—one which I think everybody who discussed the subject at the time shared. It was that alcoholism should not be regarded as a criminal offence, even though it can manifest itself as a nuisance to other people, just as the display of wounds and deformities can manifest itself as a nuisance to other people. People should treat it as a medical matter rather than think that they can prevent it by the processes of deterrence in the legal system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that we have not gone further. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax that we have continued to look at the problem with a split mind, partly from penal and partly from a medical point of view. It it had been looked upon wholly as a medical matter we would have moved further and faster and would not now be in the position of having virtually no progress to report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now clause 50 proposes to remove the sanction of imprisonment for default in payment of a fine for a drunkenness offence. I put my name to the new clause. However, I do not for one moment suggest that in its precise form it could be incorporated into legislation, the principle is the important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to ask ourselves what has happened in practice since the 1967 Act. Where people cannot be sent directly to prison because of legislative provisions, often they are fined when it is obvious that they will be neither able nor willing because of their condition of alcoholism to pay the fine. All that happens in practice is that deferred sentence of imprisonment is passed upon them. Of what possible value is that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reality of the matter is that under the penal system at present we have no proper way of dealing with them. There ought to be proper ways of dealing with them—ways of a medical rather than of a penal character.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Luton, West, who supported the new clause, and my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) both approved of the hostels that charitable organisations set up. I, too, approve of them and want to see them extended. I want to see the Government give every possible help, financial and otherwise, to those who set up and operate them. I myself take part in some of those charitable organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the right hon. and learned Gentleman agree that one way in which the Government could help these charitable organisations is to remove the imposition of VAT upon them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin:</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> There are many ways in which the Government can help charitable organisations. Certainly in the area that I represent one of the most important ways is ensuring that they get urban aid to assist them in their operations. I shall not be led aside into discussion of the difficult problems of VAT, but I should be satisfied with a great deal
	<span class='label label-info column'>656</span>
more help, in whatever way it came, to enable them to expand their activities. That applies not merely to charities which help the person who is homeless because he is inadequate or a vagrant, but also those which help a person who is in a similar position because of alcoholism or addiction to drugs. That is another grave problem. The more that those resources are expended, the less the problem will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the double system of the charity and the local authority, and I do not see that there is any real conflict in having both methods available. Nor do I see any real conflict between the desire to help people of the kind I have been mentioning and the provision of facilities for them, and the possible effect of the legislation with regard to homeless persons. I have never seen any conflict in practice and I do not think we are really running the sort of risks that have been suggested. Those who run that type of hostel or other service are the people who will be able to make sure that the resources they provide go to the proper people and not to those for whom they are not intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I say only this on the subject of new clause 50. In practice, the situation is that there are people who are not alcoholics in the true sense of the word but who have an evening out and then misbehave diemselves on the road. Sometimes they are people of substantial means. They come before the courts and they are fined. They are not the people who will be unable or refuse to pay the fine. They will be only too glad to pay the fine and get away as quickly as they can. The people who will not pay the fine are the others, the ones who cannot do it, the Skid Row people, people who cannot get along without a bottle of wine which they have managed to scrounge or even, unfortunately, methylated spirits and the other liquids to which they are reduced to drinking. They are people who have lost half of their humanity already and they will not find the other half by being put in prison. It is those at whom new clause 50 is directed, and I hope at least that the spirit of it can be accepted by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for missing the first part of die speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk). Curiously enough, I was called out to deal with the problems of a single homeless person, but I managed to put it off, for the moment at any rate, in order to come back to hear him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand from remarks of other hon. Members that he made reference to the work which is being done by organisations such as the Salvation Army, and, of course, we all pay tribute to them. I should also like—and I do not know whether he did this—to pay tribute to the campaigning work which is being done by CHAR in this connection, which has campaigned long and hard at Select Committee level, at Committee level and so on. It deserves recognition for its singleness of purpose in trying to remove the more archaic excesses of the Vagrancy Act 1824 from the statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know, either, whether my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) pointed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0500">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>657</span>
out—if he did, I apologise for repeating it—the fact that there has also been so much support for this, not only from the Home Secretary in 1980, in a speech to which my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) referred in a different part of the speech about drunkenness, but also in the Home Office study of 1981 on persistent offenders. Since that evidence is clear, I hope that the Minister will accept the new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To put people in prison for the offences described, and which appear in new clause 23—sleeping rough, and so on—does not seem to answer that kind of problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need more understanding of why people sleep rough, if they do so deliberately, or the social causes which have led people to sleep rough when they do not do so deliberately, but because they have nowhere else to go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a constituency with a very large proportion of local authority accommodation, and the ovewhelming majority of that accommodation is not for single people. It is for families. Single people in my constituency—I am not suggesting that a high proportion of them sleep rough—have a very hard time indeed. Accommodation simply has not been built, particularly for young people, who want to live on their own. We have had cases of people who have been made homeless because of some difficulty with their family, or for some other reason, and who have been picked up perhaps for sleeping in a car. This is a fairly common event among the homeless, if they can find a vehicle. We must look at the provision, as my own borough is doing, if the Secretary of State for the Environment allows it, of a much better mix of housing to suit different people, so that this possibility may not occur so frequently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Vagrancy Act mentions people sleeping on enclosed premises. It crossed my mind once or twice, when there have been late or all-night sittings at the House, that there are some people here who cannot get home and who, as it were, sleep on enclosed premises within this building. I wonder whether any of us, or any of the staff, would come under the 1824 Act if we were found lying on a sofa somewhere—presumably illegally, because that is not where we are supposed to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal of the Vagrancy Act needs looking at thoroughly. Terms like " rogue " and " incorrigible rogue" do not relate to present day circumstances and practice. It is the kind of language that the public no longer understand. They have other phraseology for it. Reference was made to people who sleep rough by choice. There are some who do so not far from here, as the hon. Member for Luton, West (Mr. Carlisle), mentioned. But down in the East End one will see people sleeping rough, very often by choice. They are not committing any particular nuisance, because they very rarely bother anybody. Perhaps the sight of them may disturb people, but that is about all. One sees them sitting in doorways looking extremely uncomfortable and
	<span class='label label-info column'>658</span>
in an unpleasant situation, but that is the life that they have chosen. Providing that they are doing no one any harm, I do not consider that it is right to shove them into prison for a few days or a few weeks. One might indeed try to persuade them into accommodation which they could use and might be able to afford. Otherwise, if that is what they like who are we to say that they should not do just that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference was also made to the small number of people who might deliberately make themselves homeless in order to have their local authority provide for them under the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act. I have yet to come across any individual case of people who make, deliberately make, themselves homeless—I accept that there may be some—but the fact is that they need a home. It is not that they have a home somewhere and just want a new home; it is that they have nowhere to live. If any of us had no accommodation, we might also resort to some device to make ourselves become the responsibility of the local authority. People like that should be despised. It is really rather that perhaps, in general, society and they themselves have not provided the roof which they actually need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Orms-kirk mentioned people who are blacklisted by certain charitable organisations because of their behaviour in those organisations. If such people throw themselves on the mercy of local authorities which are then forced to house them, they would be in a different category again from those people about whom the hon. Lady is speaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Presumably if they are blacklisted—and I did not hear the reference which was made to it—by charitable organisations, it may be because the accommodation is communal. Perhaps they really need a flat of their own, or some accommodation of their own where they would not necessarily bother anyone else, because local authorities on balance run houses for rent on an individual basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true they have half-way house or hostel accommodation as a temporary measure, but it is not quite the same as the charitable organisations which were referred to. The hon. Member for Derbyshire West (Mr. Parris) said he thought the answer was not to clear the prisons of people whose offences might not be as bad as those of other people in prison, but rather to build more prisons. It is time we tackled the whole question, as we are doing here, of these offences to see whether they constitute offences in the sense of being offensive to society rather than simply a nuisance to society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dissent from what the hon. Lady has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is helpful to have that explanation. What we need to do—as indeed the hon. Gentleman was instrumental in doing last week —is to try to see that people who have not, in the sense that we have been talking about, offended will not now be imprisoned so that there is a bit more room for people who have offended.

	<span class='label label-info column'>659</span>
I support also new clause 50. It seems to follow logically from the fact that we have got rid of drunkenness as an offence anyway. We should also remember that drunkenness is not confined to the normal kind of people who are picked up for that offence and fined. Drunkenness goes right across the whole of our society and we see it everywhere, even in this place. I have been quite offended by the sight of wealthy young men and women who climb in and out of taxis in a drunken state late at night when they are going home. But they are not the sort of people who are picked up. The people who are picked up are those who have drunk a little too much and have made themselves unpleasant or difficult or who are just lying about in a doorway. To fine them and then put them in prison because they have defaulted on a fine is not the way to cope with the situation. I have great pleasure in supporting the two new clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bendall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I have great sympathy with this new clause and basically I support it. However, a number of areas give me a little concern and perhaps when the Minister replies he can give some clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I think it is true to say that quite a number of vagrants who sleep rough both in towns and in the country are certainly not a nuisance, and do not cause trouble or aggravation to many people, if at all. But I am afraid to say that there are others who I think can be a nuisance and cause problems. For example, many young people today, often sleeping rough and on drugs, and many vagrants who are alcoholics, can cause problems. I grow a little concerned with subsection (2) of the new clause which deals with:
	<br><blockquote><p>"lodging in any barn or outhouse, or in any deserted or unoccupied building…"</p></blockquote>
A person could become a nuisance by continuously coming back to that building time and time again. I am not against the spirit of the new clause, but I think that we must be careful in certain subsections. Subsection (5) also causes me concern. This mentions:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any person convicted of going about as a gatherer or collector of alms."</p></blockquote>
Here one could conceivably have people who are imposters, not true vagrants, or others who dressed in rags to gather alms. This is a basic fraud on the public. We must be careful about this. I should be interested to have the Minister's comments on subsection (5).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 50 deals basically with drunkenness. I think that we have a problem here. In most cases of people charged with drunkenness there is usually another charge attached to it such as being drunk and disorderly. Often people badly misbehave themselves when drunk, cause a problem on the streets and act in a disorderly manner. There are problems here. I accept that drunkenness is a social problem, and that it is growing. We have heard this in other debates. It is not a problem necessarily among vagrants; it is right across the board of the social and financial scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are problems with drunkenness among people who are well off. Alcoholics Anonymous,
	<span class='label label-info column'>660</span>
which has not been mentioned this morning among the charitable organisations, does a tremendous job in this area and often prevents people from going further into alcoholism, causing greater problems not only for themselves and the ruination of their lives but problems for society as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that drunkenness is often associated with people misbehaving themselves. It is quite right to say that people getting out of taxis —dare I use that word again—cause problems. People walking along the street after parties can cause problems. On numerous occasions I have witnessed young people, not poor by any standards, throwing bricks through shop windows when they have had excess alcohol.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be quite wrong in these circumstances to say that those people, who can well afford to pay a fine but who are not prepared to do so, should not be threatened with imprisonment. This is what concerns me about new clause 50. Although I totally accept the spirit in which- it has been moved. I should be interested to hear the Minister's comments. In spirit I am in favour of the new clauses, but I want some assurances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a long and interesting debate. We have ranged over two rather separate matters although, of course, it has been convenient to have them selected for debate together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is probably helpful if I deal first with the new clause that bears on the Vagrancy Act 1824. There is, of course, a common social element to be seen in the circumstances with which both new clauses deal. More than one hon. Member has said that those who sleep rough habitually and those who beg are more to be regarded as social problems for which responsibility bears upon the whole community than they are to be regarded as criminals. I think that is the view of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, as my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris) has said, the question is whether the social problem gives rise to consequences that need to engage the criminal law. If it is one of those cases that needs to engage the criminal law, one has to ask whether imprisonment should be retained as a sanction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same is true of the person who fails to pay a fine imposed for an offence involving drunkenness. Of course, there are those who, as drunks, are unable to pay a fine but that is not common to drunkenness. There are those who have fines imposed upon them and then, by reason of some misfortune or other, are not able to pay and the law is not so stupid or harsh as to say that notwithstanding that a person cannot pay he must go to prison in default. We know this well because we have run across is in previous sessions in the Committee. The law says that either a person has to have failed wilfully or else he has to have neglected. Either a person has to make up his mind not to pay or neglected culpably to pay—in other words, he has preferred to go and spend it on something else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0502">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>661</span>
That seems to be a balanced and fair way of approaching this, providing that one accepts that the sanction of going to prison and not paying a fine ought to remain. I know that it is not common ground, but I believe that most hon. Members believe that it is necessary to retain the ultimate sanction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly, NACRO believes that to be the case. A working party, chaired by Lady Howe, produced a most impressive and persuasive report which we have referred to previously. That working party does not say that the sanction ought to go, it says that it ought to remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, the question equally comes down to whether drunkenness that leads to a fine ought, in the case of default, to be exempted from the sanction of imprisonment as a last result. That is really the question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendall) really put his finger on it because he has said that there are those who are fined for drunkenness offences who are not the down-and-outs who can perfectly well afford to pay. The question he asked us to consider is whether they should be exempt from this last sanction of imprisonment for default. When it is put in that way, it seems very difficult to see why they should.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister goes on to the vagrancy new clause, could he say how many people are in prison at the moment for failing to pay the fine for drunkenness offences? Has he any figures of recidivism for this particular offence of not paying the fine?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will do my best to help the hon. Lady. I was rather enjoying myself in a sort of broad vein at that time, but she rightly draws me back. It is sometimes helpful to precede what one has to say in terms of answering the detailed questions that have been asked by a little tour d'horizon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Budgen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wolverhampton, South-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not too big a tour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: However, this vein is very fragile and it has been totally destroyed by assaults upon it from in front and from one side, from the flank, and now from behind, so perhaps I should come to vagrancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have carefully considered whether it is possible to meet what is asked for in new clause 23. The Committee will remember that during the passage of the Criminal Attempts Act the Government were pressed to abolish imprisonment for these two vagrancy offences. The Select Committee on Home Affairs in its third report recommended that the main sleeping rough and begging offences should cease to be imprisonable. We did have reservations, which were concerned with the problems that might arise in a few cases in imposing an effective sanctions, and the fact that a number of those currently sentenced to imprisonment would inevitably end up in prison as fine defaulters instead. Therefore, at that time
	<span class='label label-info column'>662</span>
we did not feel justified in introducing legislation to give effect to the recommendation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendall) asked about the case of a person who habitually comes back to the same barn or something like that. He is clearly a nuisance, so he asks whether it would be wise to lift the penalty of imprisonment in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of somebody who is a persistent offender an injunction can be obtained very readily from the county court which itself carries in breach the sanction of imprisonment for contempt of that order of the court. So I do not think we need to hang on to the sanction of imprisonment for that offence in order to provide the safeguard that is needed in those rare circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened carefully to all the speeches that have been made on this subject and I observe the general disposition of the Committee, both on the Government and the Opposition side, to accept the principle of the new clause. I do not dwell upon certain technical difficulties that exist, but I take up the point, which again was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North, that subsection (5) of the new clause refers to an offence of—
	<br><blockquote><p>"going about as a gatherer or collector of alms"</p></blockquote>
The offence in question actually reads—
	<br><blockquote><p>"going about as a gatherer or collector of alms … under any false or fraudulent pretence "</p></blockquote>
This is a quite different offence from the first two, because it involves fraudulent pretence upon the public, and to that extent I cannot accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely in that event there are other and graver offences not committed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We would not wish to accept subsection (5) of the new clause, but I am willing to consider very carefully the extent to which we can bring forward a clause of our own that will give effect to the main thrust of new clause 23. I am persuaded by all that has been said in the Committee that it would be right to include such a measure, so I undertake to bring forward a suitable Government amendment in that sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already indicated the difficulty that I see in accepting new clause 50. I accept warmly and without reservation the need to regard drunkenness in the main as a social or medical matter, and I quite understand all that has been said on those grounds. I will, if the hon. Lady will allow me, give her the statistics that she has requested. I can tell her the offenders sentenced for the offence of drunkenness by type of sentence, for example, and I can tell her the number of persons received into prison in default of a fine by offence group. I can give her the figures, but it will inevitably take rather a long time. If she will allow me to show them to her, or write to her about them, I shall be happy to do so, and we can then find out to what extent we know the figures on recidivism, which at the moment I do not know. If she, and the Committee, will allow me to do that, I can end what I want to say about this a little more quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0503">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>663</span>
Our view on the general question of imprisonment for fine default is that it has to be retained. We shall, of course, continue to search for ways of improving fine enforcement, but in the meantime imprisonment must remain the final sanction. In these circumstances, it is hard to argue that drunkenness offenders are so different in every case from all other offenders that they ought to be excluded from imprisonment when they fail to pay a fine, always bearing in mind that wilful default or culpable neglect has to be proved, and an opportunity has to be given to show what their means are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, I hope not having taken it at too much of a canter, I invite the Committee to allow us to bring forward a new clause to give effect to the intention of new clause 23. I must advise the Committee, however, that the provisions of new clause 50 are not acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Chairman of the Federation of Alcoholic Rehabilitation Establishments, which has briefed Members of the Committee on new clause 50, I am very disappointed that the Minister is unable to accept new clause 50. It is clear, as my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill), in addressing her remarks to the new clause pointed out, there is a wide range of official and other opinion attesting to the futility of the continued imprisonment of drunks. It was the Home Office's own working party report, published in 1971, "Habitual Drunken Offenders", that called for the establishment of a range and pattern of services for problem drinkers, including hostels. It wanted 2,000 places immediately and 5,000 as an eventual target. Today we have 72 hostels, with a derisory 800 places. It called for the establishment of detoxification centres in each urban area. We now have only two, and they are both under threat of closure because of the withdrawal of Government support. The centre in Leeds and the centre in Manchester have both demonstrated that there is a more sensible and effective method of dealing with alcoholics rather than, as my hon. Friend pointed out, the vicious circle of picking them up in the streets and their ending up in prison and then back out into the streets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that the Minister was not able to make much greater efforts to meet the points made by my hon. Friend. However, I am delighted that once again he felt able to accept the principle and the intent of new clause 23. As my hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Miss Richardson) pointed out, this will delight CHAR, the Campaign for the Homeless and Rootless, and will be another important establishment of a radical principle in our penal affairs. On the understanding that the Minister has given a clear commitment to come back on Report with a new amendment that will end the immediate sentence of imprisonment for those convicted of offences under the Vagrancy Act, I beg to ask leave to withdraw new clause 23.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>664</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was most dissatisfied with the Minister's reply on new clause 50, because it seems to go totally against what his right hon. Friend the Home Secretary himself has said, which was that it is no use continuing to overburden prison staff,
	<br><blockquote><p>"too often working in antiquated and inadequate build ings, with petty offenders such as persistent drunks who could not pay their fines"</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Could not".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We have been told that these people who are in prison are there because they would not pay their fines, but the Home Secretary seems to be under the impression that in prison there are persistent drunks who do not pay their fines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that he said " qould " instead of " would " may show ignorance of the law, but he is talking about the drunks who are in prison because they have not paid their fines, and he is saying that they should be out of the prison, and the Home Secretary supports the new clause—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
