	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It had been my intention to wait until the Minister had replied to his hon. Friends before I decided whether to intervene in the debate, but my mind was made up for me by the speech from the hon. Member for Luton, West (Mr. Caslisle). I wanted to deal with that at this stage to get it out of the way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the course of his remarks, which I shall come to in a moment, on the general case for corporal punishment, the hon. Gentleman chose to use the position of blacks in relation to crime to add to his case on the basis, as I understood his argument, that since the investigations that were done by the Cadogan and Berry committees there had been a material change in the situation because we now had a black population in our inner cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was an illogical suggestion even at best. If crime has increased, it is not because of the involvement of the black population, and if corporal punishment is a deterrent to whites persumably it is also a deterrent to blacks, unless the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that there is something in the ethnic difference which also leads to a difference in reaction to corporal punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the argument still remains, whether corporal punishment will improve the situation or not. This is where we began. It has nothing at all to do with race. It has nothing at all to do with the figures produced by the Metropolitan Police in what I still regard as being a partial and unscientific assessment of the figures they have collected, and it certainly has nothing to do with the country as a whole because the Metropolitan Police figures on black involvement in crime are not reflected throughout the country. I advise the hon. Gentleman that if he wants to discuss the matter further to read the pamphlet that was produced by the Home Office research department on a study that was done in Manchester—particularly in Moss Side—which indicated that by far and away the majority of attackers in relation to street crime in that area were white and not black. I suspect that the picture will probably be the same over the country as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I indicated in my intervention, I am perfectly willing that there should be ethnic monitoring of crime. Indeed, I am all in favour of ethnic monitoring of everything, all services and all employment. What I particularly object to in relation to the Metropolitan Police is that in this very sensitive area that is being widely discussed at the moment, where Government are apparently unwilling to yield on some of the major issues of ethnic monitoring, the Metropolitan Police, who are responsible and accountable to nobody, are able to take a decision like that merely by informing the Home Secretary the day before the figures are released that this is going to happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dulwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. Friend. Would he not agree that it is even more objectionable to divide the figures into the categories of white and black as though there were no ethnic differences within the black community or, indeed, within the white community come to that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I was about to make the point that the figures produced by the Metropolitan Police, even in the worst area which is the Lambeth district, indicate that the majority of people who are involved in street

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>739</span>
crime may be black, but that number is still an infinitesimally small number of the black population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only about 4 per cent, of black teenagers are involved in street crime, even in Brixton. To condemn the whole of the black community, as the newspapers did in the aftermath of the Metropolitan Police revelations, and to brand them as muggers has been deeply offensive to the black community and has caused the Metropolitan Police a further severe problem of credibility in black areas, which is what I thought we were trying to getaway from.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me take the hon. Gentleman back to his earlier remarks about the amount of crime that had been committed and the change, which is what I was outlining this morning, that had taken place in this country because of the influx of large numbers of people from ethnic origins. Surely he would agree that inter-racial crimes could not actually physically have existed before 1948 in anything like the numbers that exist today. Racialist attacks did not exist before 1948 in anything like the numbers we see today because obviously there was not such a large number of immigrants then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I would be sympathetic with the view that obviously the indigenous white population might be as guilty as those from the New Commonwealth, it appears to many people that those from the New Commonwealth, particularly young West Indians, are to the forefront of much of the street crime and mugging seen over the last few years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the debate proceeds, I remind the Committee that Chairmen are indivisible. I do know what went on in the debate this morning. We are dealing with punishment and not the causes of crime which may be behind it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to deal with the suggestion made by the hon. Member for Luton, West that it is impossible to rely upon the figures that were produced by the Cadogan and Barry committees because there has been a change in principle in the situation caused by New Commonwealth immigration. I hoped I had disposed of it until I heard the latest intervention from the hon. Gentleman. The hon. Gentleman is using racialist attacks as the basis for suggestions that there is a totally different dimension to the crime figures. I only wish that all the people who committed racial attacks were apprehended. The fact is that very small numbers are and the number of racialist attacks, although a serious and alarming feature of race relations, is a minutely small proportion of the total crime figures, even of the crime figures of violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I would not have said that could in any way have affected this debate. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman has seen fit to put it into the debate, which is why I have met that point head on at the beginning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is typical of the whole justification of this debate. The increase in serious crime, not only in recent times but over the years since the 1930s, has indicated a different attitude towards crime by a small but increasing proportion of the population. The reason for this and the means of dealing with it concerns an immensely complex analysis and will not be answered by one
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>740</span>
simple, stereotyped remedy, either of general punishment or of one particular type of punishment. The only reason why the electorate is being inflamed at the moment into believing that, at a time when they are concerned about rising crime, there is some simple statistic, is because people like the hon. Member for Luton, West are going around bleating as if there were some simple solution. There is a group on the Conservative Benches who have taken it into their minds, since they came into the House in 1979, to suggest that some kind of populist appeal, both on race and crime, is an easy alternative to the hard slog of finding answers to difficult problems posed for society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go into the arguments that I would advance about an alternative method of dealing with increasing crime. I should be out of order if I did so, and in any case we have the debate on Thursday and I hope to take part in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall not solve this problem simply by an appeal to some kind of reactionary method such as corporal punishment if that is the only justification for it. I accept—in this I may be departing from the point of view of my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill)—that if corporal punishment could show itself to be a real deterrent, there may be a case for it. I still maintain that it would not be a case we could accept in the House of Commons in our present relationship with the European Convention. We should have to withdraw from the Convention before we accepted such action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accepted that view, if the case were sufficiently strong to show that corporal punishment was a deterrent, I for my part might be prepared to consider it. In the same way, I take the view that if there were a case for capital punishment, I might be prepared to consider that on the basis of a deterrent. Therefore—and I am sorry it if offends the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mr. Clark)—my argument must rely upon the issue of deterrence. The hon. Gentleman says that of course it is a deterrent, but whatever the plain common sense of one who has caned at Eton is, the facts do not support him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The facts suggest overwhelmingly that it is not a deterrent. I shall not bore the Committee by going through all the statistics. I just want to point to where they are so that people may read them if they so wish. There was the Cadogan committee which considered the position in 1938, when corporal punishment was still a remedy available for crimes by young men under 17 years. The committee analysed the recidivist rate of 400 people who had been sentenced to corporal punishment, and the proportion who had re-offended was either the same or was slightly lower in the case of those who had not received corporal punishment than in the case of those who had.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures were reconsidered by the Barry committee in 1960. It is true that in 1960, as the hon. Member for Luton, West said, corporal punishment had been abandoned for 12 years. But in that period, corporal punishment having been available for robbery with violence by youths under the age of 17 before 1948, the picture could be compared with what had happened in the period immediately after 1948. What happened was that robbery with violence by youths of that age had declined, and it did not get back to the 1948 figures until about 1958. So the Committee was able to say
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0548">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>741</span>
that in its view it still was not a deterrent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there was a study by a girl named Angela Kneale on birching in the Isle of Man. She took all the reported cases that she could find and analysed the recidivist rate. She found that there was no increase in the rate of crime among those who had not been birched as against those who had. In all those circumstances we must ask whether the case for corporal punishment is that it is a deterrent. How can that argument be justified when all the observable evidence is against it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We get back to the kind of instant reaction like that of the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton. I take his point, which I thought he made well, that there is a vast difference between caning in school or at home, and caning as a judicial punishment where nobody is in an intimate relationship with the person who is caned. That must be true. However, in regarding this as a deterrent and something that should not frighten us, I think that the hon. Gentleman was affected by the attitude of a boy who had been to a public school and had been caned at that school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is significant that when in the European Court this case was considered in 1978, out of the nine judges who considered the matter only one found in favour of corporal punishment on the Isle of Man. That was the British judge. Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice, who said in paragraph 12 of his opinion
	<br><q><p>"I have to admit that my own view may be coloured by the fact that I was brought up and educated under the system according to which the corporal punishment of schoolboys, sometimes at the hands of the senior ones, prefects or monitors, sometimes by masters, was regarded as the normal sanction for serious behaviour and even sometimes for what was much less than serious."</p></q>
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important factor about that admission is that it tends to animate our discussion about corporal punishment in this country. Corporal punishment has never been a punishment in other countries in Western Europe. In Western Europe they regard it as the English vice that one should beat people, particularly children. The reason why it has got into our code of law is that it became an institutional part of the public school and got into our penal system as a result. I think it has got into the public mind that somehow one can beat criminals into being better, because it has been handed down to them from that tradition. There is no evidence whatsoever for that proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the period since 1948, serious crime, in particular violent crime, has risen. It is also true that since the abolition of the death penalty in 1965 it has risen. It is not a logical connection that it has risen because of that abolition. In the Isle of Man, in the period when birching was taking place between 1950 and 1972, indictable, serious crime rose by 300 per cent, from 743 offences in 1950 to 2,262 in 1972. Birching did not stop a proportionate increase in crime in the Isle of Man any more than not having birching stopped a proportionate increase in crime in this country. Crime did not rise by any more than 300 per cent, in this country in that period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the public should recognise, not only Conservative Members—it is perhaps not so important that they should recognise it—that one cannot solve serious criminal activity and a serious in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>742</span>
crease in criminal activity by simple expedients of changing the nature of punishment. It is a vast, complex problem about how we bring up our children, educate them and raise them in standards of morality, but also how we police our society. There is a good deal of evidence to indicate that the best deterrent is the certainty of being apprehended, not the kind of punishment that is handed out on conviction. The policing element is crucial to how this is done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over recent years our detection rate has fallen very considerably, not least in the last two years when more resources have been put into the police and more policemen available in a city like London. Therefore, we have to find better ways of policing immediately— that is the best deterrent—and also look at the way we treat our children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go into the question of unemployment, but it must be an incident that crime has risen so steadily in the last two or three years as unemployment amongst the young has risen to unacceptable peaks. This is a factor we have to look at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons I come to the conclusion that we could not conceivably accept this new clause. I accept what my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax says, that this is a barbaric punishment, and I accept what the European Court said, that it is a degrading punishment. I agree that that would weigh heavily against accepting it, even if it were a deterrent. But I come back to my original point, that if it were a deterrent I might be prepared to use it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could not go as far as the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton by saying that if we had a penalty of boiling in oil we could be certain that that would deter, so we ought to boil in oil. There must be a balance in any civilised socity between the kind of punishment meted out and the kind of crime that is committed. It must be a deterrent to the culprit that if he rapes a woman he can be castrated, but that is not a proposition that any civilised being in this country would advance. It would no doubt be a bar to future thefts that a thief could have his hands cut off, but nobody would advance that as a proposition in this country. There are certain punishments which by their nature are beyond the pale. I think that the case against corporal punishment, and capital punishment, is partly animated by that, but I still maintain that I would be prepared to accept one or both if I could be shown irresistibly that they deterred. For the reasons I have indicated I do not think they do. The onus lies heavily on those who want to bring back corporal punishment and they have not-proved their case here today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Sheila Faith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belper)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one is more concerned than I am about the increase in criminal offences by young people, particularly the increase in crimes against the elderly, and the activities of football hooligans which are spoiling the enjoyment of sport and ruining this country's reputation abroad. My constituents are very worried indeed and I can understand the feelings of my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Mr. Hawksley) and my other hon. Friends who have put forward new clause 44. However, I cannot support them this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like other hon. Members who have spoken, I believe that corporal punishment still has a place in the school and the home. Parents can give their children a good
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0549">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>743</span>
beating and make amends later by being extra affectionate and kind. Teachers acting in loco parentis can also administer corporal punishment and follow this by showing sympathy and understanding in a way which is certainly not possible in a penal institution, where a quite different kind of relationship exists between the warden and the young offender than between teacher and pupil. Where there is a continuing relationship with a youngster it should not be an experience which is too traumatic or degrading either for the parent, the teacher or the child. I regret the decision of the European Court of Human Rights that parents must be able to claim exemption for their children from corporal punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Donald Harris and other ex-teachers, writing in the 	<i>Times</i> on Saturday last, 20 March, said that teachers should give up acting in loco parentis and the whole—
	<br><q><p>"pastoral rigmarole, and if a child won't work or behave, he can go home until he changes his ways"</p></q>
and discipline will be left completely to the parents. I think that this attitude is greatly to be regretted. I do not believe that the European Court understands the customs of this country, particularly the excellent training and discipline still obtainable in some of our schools—in the very schools that some Labour Members would destroy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, I believe that the new clause has no relevance in today's society. I have joined the Committee towards the end of the Committee stage and, therefore, I have not been lobbied by any of the various interested parties either for or against corporal punishment. I have, however, never held the opinion that corporal punishment would be a useful penalty to be available to our courts, and nothing I have heard today has caused me to change my mind. Perhaps I would have thought differently if birching could be administered immediately after the offender was apprehended, but the inevitable delays of the judicial process makes this quite impossible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take note of the idea of my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton (Mr. Forman) for a new inquiry into the deterrent effect of corporal punishment. I should be most interested to hear the result of that inquiry and it .^ight cause me to reconsider my decision. The aspect that I find most abhorrent is that a police officer, or someone appointed by the court, has to carry out the beating. To administer corporal punishment to a person whom they have never seen before, and will never see again, would be wholly degrading, and more degrading for the individual executing the punishment than for the offender. I also firmly believe that this would damage the relationship between the public and the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it would be easier for me to contemplate corporal punishment if it were possible for it to be administered by a robot but I think that is highly improbable even in today's mechanised world. I understand my hon. Friend's motives in proposing the new clause, but I will be voting against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

this to be one of them. In a case of this kind it often happens that we find outselves following our judgment and our conscience, perhaps in the lead of public opinion, and advancing views that we recognise will not necessarily appeal to the majority of our constituents or the majority of our local party members. I hope that Conservative Members who have had the courage to speak against the new clause will not think me in any way patronising if I welcome what they have said, without necessarily agreeing with every word that they have uttered, because I am very well aware that it requires more courage for the party which is identified in the public mind with law and order to oppose a proposal such as this. It is more difficult than for those like myself who are regarded generally as the liberal soft-centre of politics, the do-gooders who are always, it is suggested, on the side of the offenders rather than on the side of the victims. I do not accept that view, but it is frequently put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mr. Clark), who is not present in his place but who is among those who made what I thought was a courageous speech—again, I did not agree with every word of it— will reconsider his view that he should abstain on this important issue—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was hoping that the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton, who is among those to whom I have paid tribute in having the courage to speak in the way that he, and some other Conservative Members have, will have perhaps the slightly greater courage to oppose this new clause when it comes to the vote. I can assure him that Labour Members are in no sense whipped on this matter or, indeed, as far as I am aware, on any matter in relation to the Bill; we have put forward our own views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It happens, oddly enough from time to time when we have a vote, that the Opposition all vote together and the Government all vote together but there is no question of whipping. It is not unnatural that on many issues those who belong to the same political party have a certain identity of view. We do not always, and certainly there is no question here of anything of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said that I think this raises profound moral issues and I think there are two. The first is whether society is justified in using against offenders the very methods of violence which it condemns in offenders. The issue arises in respect of capital punishment and equally in relation to corporal punishment. The second grave moral issue is whether we are justified in breaching, or it would be right for us to breach, the international obligations which not only bind us but which we took part in setting up many years ago, in the days after the war when we felt, particularly, I think, the late Sir Winston Churchill, that the kind of bond that was being created by the European Convention on Human Rights was a bond which would help Europe to escape from the kind of indignities and atrocities which it faced in pre-war years and the years of the war.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always taken the view what we then did was to say—we and the other countries of Europe—"We are prepared, perhaps for the first time in history, to allow our own conduct within our own society, to be judged not by ourselves alone but by the general standards of democratic Europe."

We have done that ever since, and that was a great step forward irrespective of whether or not we have agreed with every decision of the Commission and the Court. I hope that we shall never depart from that principle which we helped to propound and which we have held up to now. I repeat the clear view that I expressed in an intervention during the remarks of my hon. Friend the Minister for York (Mr. Lyon), namely, my clear belief that we could not remain a party to that international Convention and system of regulating standards throughout democratic Europe, any more than the Greeks under the colonels were able to remain part of that system, if we undertook whenever we wished to disobey the decisions, whether we agree or disagree with them, of the Commission and the Court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is our first major moral question. In deciding that major moral question let us have regard to this fact. It is not merely that some court in Strasbourg has decided that practices that have existed in some part of the territory for which we are responsible are degrading and contrary to the provisions of the Convention. That decision did no more than give recognition to the view which virtually every civilised country, not only in the European world but in the United States and indeed, throughout most of the world, has accepted for a very long time. Except in a few countries, mostly countries that have been recently freed from the rule of colonial powers, we shall not find the acceptance of that which is proposed in the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Parris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the right hon. and learned Gentleman leaves the question of the European Convention, I want to say that I find his arguments in its favour beguiling. Would they lead him to support any judgment the European Convention might make about the closed shop practice in this country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already said that if we are to have regard for our obligations under the Convention, we must accept the decisions, whether we like them or not. This applies just as much to that particular decision— we can look at it and see exactly what it was—as to the one we are discussing at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one of the major, moral issues that arise here. I listened with great care to the answers given to my questions by the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mr. Hawksley) who moved the new clause and by one of his supporters. He was driven to the view, first, that we could not remain party to the Convention or be guided by the disciplines of our fellow members and our own agreed principles of human rights if we were to adopt the new clause he proposes, but he was prepared to accept the logic of it and said he would sooner that we accepted the new clause and ceased to be parties to that Convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put this to the Committee. Before one takes so grave and devastating a decision as that in the whole context of our respect for human rights, we really must be quite certain that in doing so we shall achieve a real and tangible advantage in our society. This brings me to the second great moral issue, as I see it. Is society ever justified in using as a punishment for violent crime the very violence which it says is a criminal offence?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again I suggest to the Committee that one can justify that only if one can show without any shadow of doubt
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>746</span>
that to do so would be of real and transcending advantage overall in the deterrence of crime. It must be right that, if society sets a certain example in what it does, inevitably people are likely to follow it and say "I am a member of that society; if society thinks it right, then can it really be so wrong?" This applies just as much to the infliction of corporal punishment as to the infliction of capital punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened to the grounds given by those supporting the new clause suggesting that there would be an overriding deterrent value in this punishment. I could find very little on balance supporting that view. I could not help coming to the conclusion that the view they were putting forward springs much more from almost a form of sentimentality, a form of natural desire to provide some retribution for the victims of violence, than the true belief that in providing this penalty one would be deterring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My mind went back to the wise and remarkable words that Sir Ernest Gower put at the end of his little book "A Life for a Life" after the report of the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment of which he was chairman. He said that when he started the inquiry he was in favour of capital punishment. There were judges and bishops and many other eminent people. He thought then that they were the people with their feet on the ground and the abolitionists were the ones with their heads in the air. By the time he had had four years of studying the subject and the evidence, he reached the conclusion that those who wished to retain it were sentimentalists and those who wished to abolish it had got their feet on the ground. I believe the same is true here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The details were given to us by my hon. Friend the Member for York, but we must not forget the fact that this was virtually the last European country to abolish corporal punishment. Elsewhere it had not really existed, except in the colonial countries, for a very long time. In addition, as long ago as 1920, a Board of Education inquiry, looking at the record of children who had been birched and what happened to them afterwards, was able to say:
	<br><q><p>"Apparently the use of the birch does very little good, for one out of every four birched returns in less than a month."</p></q>
and the figures it gives show that two out of five return in less than six months. It was for that very reason that judicial birching fell off in the years that led up to the Cadogan report. For that very reason, the Cadogan report—and there were some who originally favoured the retention of corporal punishment—eventually unanimously opposed it in 1938. For that very reason the Barry report, when the matter was brought up again some years later, agreed that it was right not to bring it back.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and learned Gentleman has quoted figues of those who came back to this particular centre those many years ago, as have many hon. Members, and the success or lack of success as a form of deterrent that corporal punishment has been. Even if the figure was as high as 75 per cent, actually returning to suffer similar punishment, as was said this morning, would he not agree that 25 per cent, did not return, so perhaps there was a modicum of success? Is there, therefore, a ratio in the right hon.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>747</span>
and learned Gentleman's mind by which he might actually gauge corporal punishment or, indeed, any other form of sentencing to be a success?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I appreciate that if one takes that kind of figure on its own it has a limited value. I do not take it on its own, and neither did the committees and commissions that have considered this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They compared the figures for those who had suffered the penalty of judicial corporal punishment with figures for equivalent people who had not, and they found again and again—according to the information that I, and I think every member of the Committeehas been given—that by an admittedly small but significant margin those who had suffered that penalty were more likely to come back to the courts than thoe who had not. That is the biggest factor, which the hon. Gentleman cannot get over by speaking of the 75 per cent, and the 25 per cent., because this compares those who have been subjected to the penalty and those in similar cases who were not subjected to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures break it up even further because they are divided between first offenders and those who already had long criminal records, and every time the figures come back to the same result. It is no wonder, therefore, that I say that before 1920, and certainly from 1920 onwards, the tendency has been for this form of punishment to fall into disrepute and for it no longer to be used as once it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Cadogan committee in its report gave two important reasons which were just as true in 1981 as they were in 1938, before the war. The report stressed the relationship between the youngsters who had suffered this punishment judicially and his parents. It said that it must be the aim of the court to enlist the support of the parents for whatever treatment was decided upon but added that—
	<br><q><p>"the court cannot, as a rule, obtain the sympathy and support of the parents in an order for birching. The parent may be quite prepared to give the boy a thrashing himself".</p></q>
The hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mr. Clark) referred to that situation. Whether one agrees with it or not does not matter. This is now the Cadogan committee saw the reaction of the public. The report continued:
	<br><q><p>"but he is often unwilling that his boy should be beaten by a policeman by order of the court. The boy who has been birched is often regarded as a martyr by his parents—they may not have condoned his original offence, but it is forgotten in their indignation at the punishment which he has received from a stranger— and where this happens the whole value of the punishment is lost."</p></q>
I believe that the statement is as true today as it was then. The report went on to say and this is the point which has been made forcefully by the hon. Member for Carshalton (Mr. Forman) in what I thought was an excellent speech that there was a great danger that the boy's companions of his own age might regard him as a hero. The Cadogan report said in 1938, by unanimous agreement of the committee, that—
	<br><q><p>"The normal boy wants to take corporal punishment like a man and, whether he has done so or not, he wishes his companions to think he has. If this is his attitude, his main desire will be to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>748</span>
show that he has not been intimidated by the punishment; and we have evidence that, only too often, he seeks to prove this by going off at once and committing a further offence."</p></q>
That is one of the reasons that justifies the figures that I have propounded. The Cadogan committee unanimously proposed abolition and eventually we got that in the post-war years, after attempts had been made to abolish it by Governments prior to that. Then, once it had been abolished, all attempts in this House to bring it back have failed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As recently as 1960 we had the report of the committee under Mr. Justice Barry, not a softie himself by any means, who came to the same conclusions as the Cadogan report that this form of punishment was not such a clear deterrent as to override all the other criticisms and disadvantages which are involved. Nothing that any hon. Member has heard today in the carefully considered and deeply felt contributions in support of the new clause have gone in any way to dispel that history and the figures on which that history is based.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view, the Committee should not be persuaded but should record by as large a majority as is possible, not leaving the matter in any state of doubt whatever, its firm belief that whatever may be the state of public opinion on this matter, whatever the views may be of the activists within the constituency parties or constituents wherever they may be, this would be wrong and the House should not countenance it. We should set this at rest if we can, at least for the length of this Parliament, but I hope for very many years to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

First, I would like to see how far learned Members can go together without dividing on any party political lines. It seems to me that it is generally agreed by those who have spoken, with the exception of the hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) and possibly the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin), that corporal punishment at home and in schools is a valid and effective method of enforcing discipline and one which certainly need not be interfered with or prevented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why do hon. Members feel that and why, indeed, do the Headmasters' Conference and the National Union of Teachers, feel so strongly that corporal punishment should be kept in schools? I suggest that the reason is simply that corporal punishment in schools is known at least known by all those who have the day-to-day responsibility for the discipline and conduct of children to be an effective deterrent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me tell the Committee of a conversation I had recently with an ex-headmaster of Charterhouse, a man of great teaching experience. He told me that he felt that the beating which he occasionally—very occasionally— had to have recourse to was extremely effective, particularly in curbing bullying and as a punishment and deterrent for thieves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The only Members who have spoken from the Opposition side so far are my hon. Friends the Members for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) and York (Mr. Lyon) and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin). Each one ias clearly indicated that he or she does not approve of the retention of corporal punishment in schools. To which other hon. Member is the hon. Gentleman referring?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I have misunderstood what occurred this morning, or attributed the remarks of those who spoke for the Social Democratic and Liberal alliance to the Labour Party, which is possible, I can only say that I have attributed to the Labour Party a greater degree of common sense than it is perhaps showing on this matter. I am certainly prepared to apologise for misguidedly having misled the Committee as to what occurred. As I say, however, I believe that if that is not the view of the Labour Party and the hon. Members who spoke this morning, it should have been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question whether or not it is a deterrent has been effectively aired by all who have the responsibility in our schools for maintaining discipline. That is something which I do not think it is right for hon. Members to ignore when looking for evidence as to whether or not this is an effective deterrent. To say that there is no evidence in the face of all the experienced commentary on the issue is to fail to give the necessary weight to the value of judgments of those responsible for looking after children and their discipline. That is clearly a matter on which we shall not agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further aspect which we must consider, and which has been raised extensively, is whether this is a degrading punishment. The hon. Member for Halifax said this morning that she considered that it was a degrading punishment. I do not think that sufficient weight is given to the question of the record and reasons for inflicting the punishment on those who are to receive it. We are talking here—at least, most of us are—about people who have committed violent crimes. Before somebody interrupts me, I think I had better stress that I cannot entirely associate myself with the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, West (Mr. Carlisle), when he took the matter of the extent of the use of corporal punishment a good deal further. I do not entirely associate myself with the wording of the new clause which I suggest gives, perhaps, too great a latitude to the courts in applying the sanction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may take my remarks as applying to corporal punishment for violent crimes, crimes of theft, and serious crimes, I believe that we are talking about
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>750</span>
degrading someone who, by his own actions, has already substantially degraded himself. I do not accept that if a youngster has mugged an old lady, or a person is guilty of bullying his own peers, or has stolen somebody else's property, that by giving him a caning of six strokes, we are degrading him, either in his own eyes or in the eyei of society, or that we are doing something which lowers his position and his status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are doing is inflicting a short and, we hope, memorable punishment, for something which is a totally unacceptable social act. The right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich made great play with the European Court on Human Rights in this context. He said that the Court held that this was degrading and that we should bind ourselves by what that Court says should be the law in this country. It is true, of course, that we are by treaty bound to the European Convention. However, we cannot accept everything that comes from that Court as binding upon us when it is in direct conflict with the interests of the people whom we represent in the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be more impressed by what the right hon. and learned Gentleman said were it demonstrable that the Labour Party had a rather better record for maintaining law and order. I refer in particular to the ominous silence from the Labour Benches on the question of Mr. Wetzel, who yesterday led Labour councillors in flagrant disregard—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>; On a point of order, Mr. Dean.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I honestly take your direction, Mr. Dean. Let me come closer to home and to something which has been raised already many times with no complaint—the question of the closed shop case in the European Court. I should like to ask the right hon. and learned Gentleman if he can give an assurance in the Committee or elsewhere that the Labour Party will enforce that law, because the European Court has suggested it should be enforced. I do not accept the view of hon. Members who take issue with those of us putting forward this proposal on the grounds that, because it is upheld by the European Court of Human Rights, we should not do so. They are applying two standards, one to the laws they approve of and the other to the laws of which they disapprove.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue is not whether we approve or disapprove.

The duty the Committee and the House have is primarily to protect the innocent, and we should do so by using three methods of protecting the innocent from the lawbreakers. First, we should have a sufficiently strong force—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.49 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Division was called I was reaching the point in my short speech where I was talking about the duty of the House to protect innocent members of society against those who break the law— the duty of this House and the Government to provide an adequate police force, an adequate level of enforcement, the laws necessary to protect individual rights and the duty to give to the courts adequate powers to pass a sentence which will be effective. To be effective, I suggest that the courts must have the power to pass a sentence which will both deter and punish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already talked at some considerable length in the Committee about the question of deterrents and, as I said earlier, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton, although he prefers to rely on experience and instinct rather than on any confusing statistics that may be drawn. As I also said, I believe that the parallel with the deterrents of corporal punishment at school and at home is a valid one, although I absolutely accept what my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton said, that such punishment would be far better carried out at home and in the school which are the proper places for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, unfortunately, it has to be said that parental control of children has now reached a level where it is no longer possible to rely upon it to safeguard society. Likewise, the move of teachers away from a custodial and caring and responsible role—custodial is the sense of having custody of the child, of being in loco parentis. They are now much more concerned with teaching that the standard of discipline, I am sorry to say, in many areas is falling to a level where it is no longer adequately controlling the misbehaviour of the children. So, it is not happening either at home or in the schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, what role should Parliament give the courts in this matter? I, personally, support the idea that it is necessary for the protection of the public in general to give the courts the right in certain circumstances to order the infliction of corporal punishment themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The unfortunate fact is that at the moment juvenile courts have a lamentable weakness in the eyes of the children whom they are supposed to discipline. Most hon. and learned Members will be able to cast their minds back to the time when they first started practising at the Bar and, therefore, practised in juvenile courts. I certainly remember the disregard in which juvenile
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>752</span>
courts were held by the children who were brought before them, particularly those childsen who were brought before them for the second or third time and who had, therefore, woken up to the fact that the punishments which those courts could inflict were far too ineffective to have any adequate source of fear for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unfortunately necessary, when controlling those youngsters who will misbehave, to have a sanction which will make them afriad of facing up to the punishment which is to be inflicted. I do not believe that that is currently so; the juvenile courts lack the powers that they need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also accept what my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton said about the difficulty of drawing a balance between whether this is an adequate deterrent to offset the other effect that might result—thrt the child would wish to show pride in the fact that he had stood up to this punishment so well. It is difficult for children to show pride in these circumstances, provided the court has made it sufficiently clear that their conduct is such as to be intolerable to all their civilised contemporaries. I do not accept, on balance, that the effect would make these children sin more greatly. I believe that it would be seen as a deterrent, although I accept that there is a balance there and the point could be argued either way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quite clearly, the standard of behaviour at the moment is not tolerable, the level of violence which we have in our society, particularly the level of violence among the younger generation—the children—has reached a point where new remedies have to be found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been clearly demonstrated by the crime figures, and by what happens in our streets every day, that the way in which the law is operating at the moment is insufficient to protect the innocent bystander from the young thug and the lawless element in our society. There will have to be changes, and it is quite right that we should be debating here whether this is one of the changes that should be made. There may be other remedies which would also be effective. Nobody would claim—as I think the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich attributed to those of us who support the new clause—that this proposal would have some kind of magic panacea effect. Of course it would not. But as one of my hon. Friends said earlier—and I entirely endorse what he said—if by introducing this penalty we can cut the number of muggings, albeit only by a few, I believe that the innocent lives which have been put in danger, and the innocent people who have suffered serious violence and terrible injuries, will justify the imposition of this penalty. If we could save a few of those that would be enough, in my mind, to justify the introduction of this sanction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On balance, while appreciating many of the points that have been made by those who disagree, I feel that the new clause should be supported by the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for The Wrekin (Mr. Hawksley), who moved the new clause, and his hon. Friends who support him, have a duty to satisfy the Committee that birching would act as such a deterrent, and so cut the crime figures, as to justify its reintroduction. That is the heavy task that falls on them today. They seek to reintroduce a form of punishment which has not been used in this country

since 1948. It was abolished in 1948, and had fallen into disuse and disrepute and was used less and less by then, as the figures show.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1900, no less than 3,385 judicial birchings were ordered by magistrates. By 1948, there were only eight. If in fact birching was so palpably and obviously an effective form of punishment, if it was such an overwhelmingly valuable deterrent as Conservative Members who support the new clause would wish us to believe, why did it fall inio disrepute? Why was it so seldom used by the courts and why was it eventually abolished? The answer is that the magistrates, the courts and every committee of inquiry since then have established at the very least that it was doubtful whether birching had any deterrent effect at all, and at worst that the incidence of re-conviction and recidivism among those who were birched was very high indeed. They were very likely to commit another similar offence very shortly afterwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Conservative Members rest their case—as they do over and over again—on the value of birching as a deterrent, they have singularly failed on all the evidence to prove their case. I cannot see that they have brought forward one statistic or fact to establish its deterrent effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither can the Committee ignore the fact that on other country in the West, no other country even behind the Iron Curtain, administers or allows this form of punishment. The only countries where corporal punsihment is a standard form of justice is in those countries whose standards of legal procedure, whose adherence to civil liberty standards that we regard as acceptable, are very dubious indeed.

Will this Committee and the House agree that this country, whose standards of justice over the years have been a model for other countries, will stand side by side in such strange company; in the company of countries which we in this country would be the first to criticise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman was searching for somewhere where it could be said that birching was a deterrent. I bring to his attention something which has been mentioned before today, the most modern and recent example that we have—the Isle of Man where birching was withdrawn in 1976 and the rate of criminal offences has actually risen since that time. Is that not perhaps the example for which he was searching?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman continues to refer to the Isle of Man. It is a tragedy that that lovely little island where we have all holidayed should now be world famous for something as obnoxious as birching. TT racing is a far nicer thing to remember the Isle of Man by than birching.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman talks as if all they do in the Isle of Man is birch youngsters. They do not, they hardly ever birch them. The incidence of birching is very small indeed. I do not think the hon. Gentleman can prove one way or another that the Isle of Man figures prove that birching is a deterrent. I am not satisfied that they prove it one way or the other I cannot be fairer than that.

Whenever there is an outcry and public indignation about the incidence of violence, there is always a tendency to want to find some easy solution. It is no good Conservative Members saying "Is it not terrible how crimes of violence have increased". It is terrible and we should all be deeply concerned about it, but that in itself is not an arguement for bringing back corporal punishment. The only justification would be if one were certain that it was so culpably a deterrent that it would make some inroads into those appalling figures. The hon. Member for Luton, West (Mr. Carlisle) has not provided that at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intervened in his speech and he argued that occasionally—I do not want to pin him to his exact words— some sort of phycisal punishment is necessary. I was not being flippant when I put it to him, but how physical should the punishment be? If six strokes of the birch do not make a dent in the crime figures, will he and his hon. Friends lead a national campaign to increase the num-be of strokes of the birch to 10,12, 15 or 18? It is possible, because he will again be looking for a reason and another simplistic solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Increasing the number of strokes will be very easy. We can do it by an administsative Act. We need not debate it in this Chamber. It could all be done very simply. This constant searching and pretending that some easy, magical solution can be found that will satisfy public opinion on the one hand and make a serious impact on the crime figures on the other is misleading and dangerous to the public and should not be indulged in at the rate it has been recently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the arguments against judicial birching is that there is bound to be a delay from the time the court has considered the case, right through the appeal process, to the time when the first lash is administered on the offender's clothed posterior, as set down in the new clause. When my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) taxed the hon. Gentleman with the issue, his hon. Friend came up with the most extraordinary answer. "Abolish the right of appeal", he said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the hon. Gentlman seriously suggesting that the only punishment administered by the court which could not be subject to a right of appeal should be if the court passed a sentence for birching? That would be a strange intrusion into English law. I can see all those magistrates who do not want their decisions appealed against saying "Let us birch him and there is bound to be no right of appeal." It is a nonsense, and to intrude such a proposition into a debate of such importance does not do justice to the occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. and learned Gentleman not consider that in practice, in most cases, where someone has been sentenced to a birching, he might not prefer to accept that punishment, take it, and not appeal? In fact, few appeals would be wanted, as we have already seen in the Tyrer case and in the other case in the Isle of Man last year, when the young offenders wished to withdraw their appeals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does that act as a deterrent? The hon. Gentleman is arguing against himself. I do not have much more to say, because the arguments have all been put over and over again. One of my hon. Friends mentioned the degrading nature of the punish

ment to which the European Court referred. It is a degrading punishment. If the hon. Member were to look at history over the years, right back to medieval times, he would find that in medieval times, slaves were birched but free men were never allowed to be birched, the reason being that it was considered such a degrading punishment, far too degrading for a free man. That is why, even in medieval times, it was frequently abandoned by some of the more moderate rulers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for The Wrekin has to satisfy the Committee first, that birching actually deters and secondly, that if it were introduced how we would reconcile it with our treaty obligations. Thirdly, he must satisfy us that he is happy to have this country ally itself with some of the most obnoxious regimes in the world, where alone of the civilised countries, birching goes on. He must satisfy us too, that the person who is birched does not wear that birching as a badge of pride.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over and over again, if we analyse the report to which we have referred, there are references to young offenders who are so eager to impress their friends, colleagues and fellow members of the gang with how brave and bold they have been in standing up to this appalling treatment, that they treated it as a sort of noble war wound. I believe that the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends have failed in discharging any of those arguments, and I have faith that when the Minister replies he will wholly demolish any jot or tittle of case that has not been dealt with in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in the course of a debate of the highest importance on a new clause which would empower magistrates' courts in certain circumstances to impose a sentence of whipping. The power would be limited to cases where the convicted person was a male aged between 10 and 18 and where his offence was either unlawfully assaulting and beating up any other person, making use of provoking language or behaviour leading to a breach of the peace or committing an act of Criminal damage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have all appreciated the deep sincerity with which my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Mr. Hawksley) has moved the new clause. With crime at its present level, any proposals—certainly these, which have attracted some serious support—deserve to be seriously discussed in the Committee. I certainly do not intend to criticise the new clause or these proposals on the ground of their technicality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Listening to the debate, I reflected on how much common ground there is, even on the Government side. I had not realised that it included the fact that we all went on holiday to the Isle of Man, but I am sure I am the odd man out there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there is the common determination that we shall do everything we properly can to reduce juvenile crime and, indeed, all crime. I think of the desire expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin to protect the interests of those who are crime's victims. This was reflected by my hon. Friends the Members for Rossendale (Mr. Trippier) and Nant-wich (Sir N. Bonsor), who pointed out that we have a responsibility to people who are beaten by criminals. I am glad that the Bill which we have already discussed greatly improves the ability of the courts to order
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>756</span>
compensation and for people who have been the victims to receive compensation from those who harmed them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think too of the belief expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale that mere retaliation for violence can never be right and that real deterrence must be seen, although not for everybody, if corporal punishment is to be justified. This seems to be common ground. We all share that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, West (Mr. Carlisle) said that for young violent offenders retribution would be their just desserts. We would all agree with that. It is not in dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mr. Clark) spoke of the danger of institutionalising violence. All of us see the force of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, although I gather that hon. Members now object to all corporal punishment in all circumstances, at least outside the family—although I note that they did not legislate to secure it when they had the opportunity—most of us, including most hon. Members, see that there is an important distinction, whatever our views are on the new clause, between corporal punishment judicially awarded by a court after the legal process has been completed and the cane or the strap that is imposed at school. I certainly see this and took very much the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Belper (Mrs. Faith) in her speech on the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the very reasons described by my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton, that it is applied at school by someone who knows the child, has responsibility for him and has a continuing relationship with him—I would add because it is applied virtually at once and not after weeks or maybe months have gone by from the offence—whatever the impact of the Strasbourg judgment upon what we have called the Scottish case, my own criticism of the effect of corporal punishment imposed by a court is certainly not levelled at the schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of this is to a greater or lesser degree common ground. The question is not whether the interests of the victims are to be protected—of course they are—and through them the interests of the community. We all agree that they are to be protected by the best means that we may properly devise. The real question is whether they would be the better protected by the provisions of the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For my part, I intend, of course, to deal with the new clause on its merits, but at the outset there is value perhaps in recalling certain matters of historical fact established beyond contest which form at least the context for our discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, in so far as the new clause brings back corporal punishment into the law of England and Wales, it brings it back from a period in our penal history that is surprisingly distant. It is, of course, widely known that it was in 1948 that Parliament swept away the remaining powers for courts to pass sentences of whipping, which is the term that the statutes have always used for punishment by cat-o'-nine-tails or the birch, but it is less widely known, I think, how narrowly restricted by Parliament those powers already were in 1948 even for juvenile offenders. For boys the power to order whipping was available whenever there was a summary conviction—that is by a magistrates' court, of course— for any indictable offence, but in contrast to the new
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0556">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>757</span>
clause the upper age limit was only 14 not 18.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That restriction was not imposed by what my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale would call "do-gooders" in some post-war excess of softness. It had been imposed 101 years earlier in 1847, in the case of convictions for simple larceny. In 1879, that age limit of 14 had been applied to all cases where boys were summarily convicted on indictable offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also true that where boys were convicted on indictment for certain offences against the person and certain offences of larceny and malicious damage—that is, on indictment by the higher courts—the courts had the power to whip, but only where the boy was under 16. That was the age limit also for the power to whip for unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under 13, but that was the total extent to which in 1948 the law permitted the whipping of juveniles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will examine in a moment the extent to which the courts were by then actually making use of those powers; a matter, if he will allow me to say so with respect, curiously neglected in my hon. Friend's speech proposing the new clause. I want, first, to point out that for an offence of provoking language or behaviour tending to a breach of the peace, no statute in England and Wales has ever authorised whipping. Thus, we should recognise that in so far as the new clause may be said to bring back judicial corporal punishment, it would not simply restore what was removed in 1948. It would bring back to the law of England and Wales powers that last existed in a period of our statute law that is now very distant indeed, and in so far as it would enable a sentence of whipping to be passed on a juvenile convicted of making use of provoking language or behaviour tending to a breach of the peace, it would confer on courts in England and Wales a power which no statute ever previously conferred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not for one moment claim that these facts taken by themselves are necessarily more than of mere historical interest. If they are to exercise any persuasive influence on us today we need to know what reasoning it was that led the Victorians over 130 years ago to begin to curtail the availability of this punishment; a punishment so much more in tune with the philosophy of their times than it can be said to be in tune with ours. Then we need to go on to examine how that reasoning stood the test of experience in their times and more recently and, lastly, whether anything has since changed to invalidate that reasoning today. That is the process that we must follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we find that the Victorians' general reasoning is succinctly expressed in the seventh report of the commissioners on the criminal law. They said that judicial corporal punishment was a punishment
	<br><q><p>"which is uncertain in point of severity, which inflicts an ignominious and indelible disgrace on the offender, and tends, we believe, to render him callous, and greatly to obstruct his return to any honest course of life."</p></q>
That report was written in 1843. It was in reliance on that report that as a judicial penalty for adults corporal punishment was virtually abolished in 1861, and the age limits for its application to juvenile offenders were fixed. It was later restored for a very few, mostly specialised, offences for adults, of which by far the most important was robbery with violence. But at no time
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>758</span>
after 1861 was corporal punishment available as a judicial penalty for adults for other crimes of violence or for sexual offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, my hon. Friend the Member for The Wreken is entitled to point out that the Victorian reformers, when they greatly curtailed corporal punishment for adults as I have described in the 1861 statutes, nevertheless retained it more generally for juveniles, albeit within the age limits that I have mentioned, and his new clause is limited to offenders up to 18 years of age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here a further matter of history seems to me to be important. There was at that time virtually no practical alternative to prison as a punishment for a juvenile offender, other that whipping. I think that one has only to dip into the works of Henry Mayhew on the Victorian prisons to see why Parliament considered that for a boy whipping was generally more suitable than prison. I must be permitted a nepotic plug.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The contrast with today, however, is surely a marked one. Again, this must be factual common ground, I would suggest. Magistrates' courts now have a wide range of sentences available for juveniles, including fines, supervision orders, care orders and attendance centre orders. Under the law as it now stands, magistrates' courts can commit juveniles aged 15 and over to the Crown court with a view to a sentence for borstal training, soon to be replaced by the determinate sentence of youth custody. Moreover, we are introducing in the Bill a range of other measures to strengthen the courts' powers in relation to young offenders, giving them great flexibility both in custodial and non-custodial sentences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It cannot be said, as it could have been and was said a century ago, that there is no alternative to corporal punishment for juveniles. There is a wide range of alternatives and it will shortly be significantly widened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that we may usefully judge whether the Victorians' general reasoning has proved in the event to be right or wrong by looking at the use which the courts have made over the years of the powers to order whipping that the Victorians had left to them. Substantial and sustained use of those powers to order whipping over the years, or an increased use of those powers, would suggest that the sentence was found to be of value as a deterrent. But if on the other hand declining use was the experience, that would support the contrary conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we have an incontestable fact in the benefit of the invaluable collection and analysis of the facts carried out by two strong public bodies. One—the Cadogan Departmental Committtee—considered the issues in 1938, when the sentence was still available on the scale provided by the Victorians. The other subjected them to further review in 1960, 12 years after the sentence had been abolished, and considered whether it should then be restored. That was the Advisory Council on the Treatment of Offenders—sometimes called the Barry report—headed by the High Court Judge, Sir Patrick Barry and including among its members the Metropolitan Magistrate, Mr. Paul Bennett, VC and the then Commissioner of Police for the City of London, and subsequent Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Colonel Young. It was not a council composed of softies. By the late 1930s, the power to order whipping for juveniles had become
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0557">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>759</span>
virtually a dead letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inflictions by magistrates in England and Wales had fallen from 3,385 in 1900 to 58 in 1939. By 1947, that figure had fallen to eight. I do not know if the courts had access to statistics. It was probably the result of their experience and instirinct—qualities prefered, and I sympathise with them, by my hon. Friends the Members for Plymouth, Sutton and Nantwich. I suspect it was the result of their experience and their instinct that lead the courts to turn into a virtual dead letter the power of whipping that had been bequeathed to them by the Victorians.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In London, the Metropolitan juvenile courts had ceased to use it altogether by the early 1920s. The Cadogan committee in 1938 expressed its unanimous conclusion as follows:
	<br><q><p>"After examining all the available evidence, we have been unable to find any body of facts or figures showing that the introduction of a power of flogging has produced a decrease in the number of offences for which it may be imposed, or that offences for which flogging may be ordered have tended to increase when little use was made of the power to order flogging or to decrease when the power was exercised more frequently …"</p></q>
The Barry report in 1960 commented that the more experienced juvenile courts evidently considered that other methods available to them were more effective. That report followed up case histories of violent offenders under 21 convicted between 1941 and 1948. While warning that statistical evidence is of limited value, they found that the proportion of young offenders whipped for violence who re-offended by committing violent offences or major non-violent offences was higher than the proportion of those young offenders who had not been whipped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This was a point that I put to the hon. Member for Halifax at the beginning of this debate and she did not answer. Perhaps my hon. and learned Friend would answer it now. Is it not right to say that at that time other penalties available to the court, particularly the approved school and the borstal sentences, were very much stronger than anything now available to the courts. Therefore, to compare the result of whipping with the result of those penalties is misleading in a modern day context?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it is perfectly true to say that borstal was longer and the approved schools were tougher than what is available today by way of a custodial sentence. Detention centres on the other-hand are tough and getting tougher. There is something ofa point there, but of course the Barry committee recognises that these results might be because only the tougher customers with the worst records were sentenced to be whipped. It analysed the results by reference to the previous records of the offenders in each class, including those with no previous serious convictions, and offenders were found slightly more likely to re-offend if they were whipped than were those with similar records who were not whipped. The council unanimously concluded that the re-introduction of corporal punishment could be justified only if there was a reasonable assurance that it would sunstantially reduce crime and afford real protection to potential victims. We must surely all agree with that test. It said
	<br><q><p>"We think that there cannot be any such assurance. There is no
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>760</span>
evidence that corporal punishment is an especially effective deterrent either to those who have received it or to others."</p></q>
All of these things are matters of estalished fact relating either to events before whipping was abolished or the the Advisory Council's report after it was abolished. I concede again that none of that may matter. Things may have changed to a significant degree. The opinions then expressed may have been wrong all the way down the years. We must see if that is likely to be the case. The burden must lie upon my hon. Friend who proposes this new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is said, and really said only by him, that the Manx experience puts a different completion on the matter and proves that whipping is a deterrent. I did not gather from his speech that he thought that any other considerations mattered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One set of statistics alone, said my hon. Friend, proved the case that the number of assaults went up from two in the year before the Tyrer judgment in the European Court to 10 in the year after and 12 in the year after that. I will only observe that it only requires a couple of brawls, one in each year, and 10 or 12 assaults can easily be achieved. As it happens, the figures for assaults are as follows, taking the years from 1976 to 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1976 there were 54; in 1977, 45; in 1978, the year of the judgment, 50; in 1979, the year after the judgment 37, and in 1980, 67. I am not a statistician but I am advised that the numbers and the time scale are simply too small to reflect trends, let alone to develop any relationship between those trends and a cessation of corporal punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then my hon. Friend relied on his researches into the subsequent records of 76 people, adults and juveniles, whipped in the Isle of Man since 1960. I think he said 40 per cent, were visitors to the island. He must have had access to the Criminal Records Office if he is to be sure what happened to all those who were domiciled outside the island. But what seems to me to be really important when considering a claim that statistics in the Isle of Man prove whipping to have been a deterrent must be the opinion of the Isle of Man Attorney-General who in 1981, in a speech to the magistrates of the Isle of Man from which he has specifically authorised me to quote this passage, said:
	<br><q><p>"As regards the merits of judicial corporal punishment, I will only say that it is impossible to prove from statistics that it is effective as a deterrent."</p></q>
Since it is upon statistics over some 20 years that my hon. Friend relies, that is an opinion which the Committee will wish to heed and on which it is wise to rely, I would myself not be so rash as to assume that whipping deterred nobody. It certainly deterred me at school, but there were others whom it did not deter. My hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton, is right to say that deterrents have to be but one element in the composite of our approach to criminality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the face of the almost total disuse to which the courts' experience of corporal punishment led them to allow it to fall, which suggests that they found it almost valueless as a deterrent, I cannot recommend that the view that was put forward by my hon. Friend about Isle of Man statistics and the Isle of Man experience
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0558">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>761</span>
ought to lead us to restore it on the mainland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1960, human nature has not changed, but there are two important changes that have taken place. They have both been referred to already in our debate and, therefore, I will not take long over them. The first is that although the new clause rightly, and in accordance with precedent, requires that a doctor should be present at the infliction of corporal punishment or whipping, any such attendance, and certainly any certification of fitness to undergo whipping, is now declared by the BMA to be contrary to its medical etchis ethics. I will not take time by reading from the letter, but that seems to me to be a matter for very great practical importance. It is a practical consideration of great importance, because it means that generally it will not be possible, even were we to adopt the new clause, to find doctors who would be prepared to carry out the supervision that my hon. Friend rightly asks for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second is, of course, that the European Court of Human Rights has ruled that whipping constitutes degrading punishment and, as such, contravenes article 3 of the Convention. We know that that Convention came into effect in 1953. We know that its provisions form part of the international law by which our country is bound. We know that the United Nations Convention on Civil and Political Rights is to the like effect. Any offender now sentenced to corporal punishment would, when he had exhausted his domestic rights of appeal, be bound to be advised to appeal to the European Court, and such a complaint would almost certainly be upheld.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to defy the Convention berore that case was heard or thereafter—if it went against us—that would hardly be seen to harmonise with our concern for respect or the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. and learned Friend proposing that corporal punishment in schools should be abolished, or am I right in understanding that he supports the current views expressed by some of his ministerial colleagues that it is desirable that such punishment should continue to be available?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not lie with me as to what steps are taken. I have quite a lot of problems with the Home Office without mentioning the problem of education, let alone in Scotland. It is a straight matter of law, and, so long as we retain our membership of the European Court of Human Rights, it is a little difficult to claim special respect for the law if we conduct ourselves in a way that conflicts with what that court has ruled. That is all that I say on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the practical considerations which the advisory council had in mind when it said that without a reasonable assurance that it would substantially reduce crime and afford real protection to potential victims the introduction of corporal punishment could not be justified. First, I mention the mode of implementation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.36 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended/or a Division in the House.</i></p>
	<p>6.51 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I was about to refer to certain practical
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>762</span>
consideration that had weighed recently with the Barry committee. I said that I would briefly refer to the problem of implementing whipping. I note that under the new clause the boy would keep his trousers on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the passage at paragraph 75 of the Barry committee report dealing with the mode of implementing whipping on juveniles. My hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton referred jestingly in his speech to erecting some cruciform wooden structures to which the boy should be secured. The Barry committee said:
	<br><q><p>"We have heard that in one district the boy is strapped to an apparatus similar to the triangle used for corporal punishment in prisons"</p></q>
Then there is the delay. That has been referred to often today, and I shall not take time over that, but I understand that in the Metropolitan Police district, for example, a delay of at least one month is usual between the apprehension of a juvenile offender and a decision whether to administer a caution or prosecute the offence in court. To that delay must be added any delays that arise from time-tabling difficulties in juvenile courts, and those which commonly arise where the court decides to adjourn a case so that reports on the juvenile can be obtained. I think it likely that within the present system, any sentence of corporal punishment would be inflicted at least two months after the commission of the offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the practical considerations that militate against judicial corporal punishment, I think that perhaps the most persuasive is revealed by the evidence from psychiatrists to the advisory council in 1960, to the effect that whereas some offenders respond to judicial corporal punishment and suffer no ill effects from it, others would be significantly harmed. Witnesses were agreed that if an individual already had a substantial element of resentment in his makeup, judicial corporal punishment would be more likely to make him more bitter and resentful and therefore more, rather than less, inclined to behave in an anti-social manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many youths, far from being deterred by the prospect of corporal punishment, would accept the punishment as a means of showing that they were tough. Moreover, in order to maintain their status in the eyes of their friends, many who had received judicial corporal punishment were likely to commit further offences to show that they had not been intimidated. That was the nature of the evidence, which is consistent with what has been mentioned in other speeches today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if medical co-operation could be obtained, and even if it were possible to identify such offenders, surely to exempt them from corporal punishment while other less intractable youths received it, would hardly seem just. What effect might that be expected to have on the attitudes of the latter towards the virtues of the law?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention those among other practical considerations that weighed with the advisory council in leading it to its conclusions. Those conclusions were prefaced with this paragraph:
	<br><q><p>"In view of the great conflict of opinion on this subject, it would not have been surprising if, at the outset of our enquiry, some of us had not thought that the reintroduction of judicial corporal punishment might be justified as a means of checking the growing increase in crime generally and in offences of hooliganism in particular. That was, in fact, the case, but, having studied the views expressed to us and the available evidence, we consider that

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>763</span>
the findings of the Cadogan Committee are still valid, and have come unanimously to the conclusion that corporal punishment should not be reintroduced as a judicial penalty in respect of any categories of offences or of offenders."</p></q>
In the light of the practice to which I have referred, a very heavy burden lies on those who seek to any degree to dislodge those conclusions. It is said rightly that there has been a grave increase in the number of crimes of violence against the person. It should never be far from the considerations of those of us with interests, let alone responsibilities, in this field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not follow from that alone, however, that the case of the new clause is made. In one of "Punch's" most disagreeable or nastier jokes about housemaids the girl with the illegitimate baby is shown as saying "It is only a small one, Mum". If it is shown to be ineffective at best, or at worst harmful, to impose corporal punishment on a small number of offenders over the years, the case for its restoration is not advanced by showing that the number of offences is now greater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say to the Committee that, eloquent and deeply sincere though the speeches in favour of the new clause have been, the conclusions, first, of the Cadogan committee and then of the Barry committee remain to the Government both valid and strongly persuasive. I cannot therefore advise the Committee to accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Dubs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has clearly indicated that the case for the proposal falls on two grounds. First no evidence has been put forward that convincingly states that this new punishment would deter. Secondly, the Minister has also stated clearly that it is not in this day and age an acceptable form of punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister has covered the ground so fully, I should like to add only a brief word in support of one of the points he has made. It seems to me that, when faced with increased violence in our society, it is important that we should seek to analyse as best we can the reasons for this, even if that is not a task which is before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we have before us a proposal to impose a form of punishment which for at least a third of a century we have not had in this country, we should be very careful about the possible consequences. I submit that we should avoid doing anything that is liable to brutalise the individual. I would have thought that the evidence of this particular form of punishment is that it is liable to have a brutalising effect on some people. It would be liable to lead them to be more hostile to society and to express that hostility in the form of violence. The old adage that "violence breeds violence" is apt and true and applies to this proposal. Therefore I am convinced that it would be wrong for us to support it. I hope that the Committee will reject it overwhelmingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Lyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemel Hempstead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although my hon. and learned Friend the Minister has put most of the arguments very fully, I should like to explain why, although I understand the reasons why my hon. Friends have introduced the new clause and although I think it is quite proper to discuss it in the context of the Bill, I nevertheless think that it would be wrong to reintroduce corporal punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>764</span>
It is proper to discuss the topic because the whole purpose of the Bill is to cover the complete framework of penalties which are provided to our criminal courts in dealing with the many and varied offences that come before them. There are at least a significant number of people in this country, though I would suggest a far smaller number than believe in capital punishment, who, by instinct, think that the reintroduction of corporal punishment would be beneficial. It will undoubtedly help them further to consider the matter and to have confidence in Parliament to know that we have debated it fully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of my worries about the debate is that it might deflect attention—and I hope it has not done so—from the strong measures that the Government are taking to promote proper law and order, to assist the police, to reinforce the prison system and to provide the courts with a wide and appropriate range of penalties for current offences. Those who are anxious ought to be reminded time and again that we have now, less than three years after taking office, over 9,000 more policemen than when we came to power, that our police are better trained and equipped and that we are spending more on equipment in real terms than has been spent in recent years, and possibly more than ever before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that people should be told that we have started on the largest prison building programme in this century. It is certainly right that people should know that the Bill provides the widest and most flexible range of penalties to the courts and restores to them the discretion, in a much wider way than has recently been the case, to choose the penalty that is appropriate to the offender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is against that background that we should consider whether corporal punishment is a wise addition to the many penalties that will be available when the Bill becomes law. It is in that context that we should consider it on its merits. There is undoubtedly a case for the use of corporal punishment in selected and appropriate cases at home and at school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even there the climate of opinion has changed substantially and I am glad about that. After all, early this century in some of our schools it was the standard form of punishment for a wide variety of offences. Within the family and within a closed community such as a school —including day schools—caning, as a serious deterrent, though not the ultimate deterrent, has a significant place for boys. I say that it is not the ultimate deterrent because the ultimate deterrent in school is expulsion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we should seek to do in considering the whole question of treatment is to keep people within society. Within a school, although caning is a severe and important deterrent, those punished nevertheless remain within the society of- the school and the punishment is applied by people who continue to have, and who have already had, responsibility for the upbringing of the pupil concerned. That is a wholly different environment, as other members of the Committee agree, from what happens in the case of judicial corporal punishment, where it is quite impersonal and is carried out by someone who by definition has probably never met the person being punished and will never meet him again, and who has no personal responsibility for his continued upbringing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0560">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>765</span>
Ever since I was at school I have always believed that the fundamental and clearest argument against judicial corporal punishment is the inevitable delays attendant upon the system—the delay in coming to court to be tried and convicted in the first place, with the possibility of corporal pinishment in existence, and then the delays in carrying it out. Although the new clause rightly seeks to provide that it should be carried "as soon as practicable" we cannot get away from the fact of appeal, both against conviction and sentence. In a civilised society we simply cannot say that the magistrates, or whatever court imposes a sentence of corporal punishment, shall not have that sentence or that conviction subjected to the normal review which applies to all other penalties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no civilised society that I know of which has no form of appeal on its judicial sentences. That, I should have thought, was particularly important in a case where a sentence which was expected to be of special severity and to have a deterrent effect had been imposed. That means that there is bound to be a significant delay between the imposition of the sentence and its being carried out. Everybody who has ever discussed corporal punishment and recognised its merits both in the home and in the school almost invariably says that it should happen swiftly and, as far as possible, if not in anger at least in the heat of the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move on to another point concerning the framework of the Bill, and that is parental responsibility. The Government and the Bill rightly seek to emphasise the importance of the responsibility of parents for the behaviour of their children and of their teenage offspring and there are measures in the Bill, both positive and negative, which seek to reinforce that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the measures that make parents responsible for the payment of the fines of their children and, even more important, make parents responsible for compensation orders made against the children as a result of their doing damage either to public or private property or as a result of theft. The making of such compensation orders is almost universally recognised as a just part of the penalty and restoration which should follow a conviction for such an offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Cadogan report was right when, in 1938, it found that in cases of corporal punishment, parents who had profoundly disapproved of the behaviour of their children nevertheless backed away from that disapproval and close ranks to sustain their children when a sentence of corporal punishment was threatened or imposed. Indeed, I can understand that very well as a parent, and I think that it would be my own feeling, because, richly deserved the penalty might be in one sense, in the face of a judicial sentence and the long delays which would have to be sustained before it was carried out, it would be right for the parent to give that sort of support in the circumstances. That is a cogent reason why it is wrong, therefore, to introduce it as a judicial, as opposed to a school or home, penalty. My hon. Friend the Member for Nantwich (Sir N. Bonsor) said, either prvately to me or publicly, that it is desirable that parents should sometimes take it upon themselves to punish their children corporally in cases where they are coming before the court and it is certainly right that the court should take that into account in its penalty, but that is a wholly different
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>766</span>
matter. It would go against the objectives of the Bill in reinforcing parental responsibility if we were to take this particular power for the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now move to the deterrent effect, which has been fully dealt with from both sides of the Committee. I am sceptical of statistics in this area—not only statistics that tend to show that either capital or corporal punishment is a deterrent, but statistics that tend to show that it is not a deterrent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statistics are wholly inconclusive because, just from instinct, I do not have the slightest doubt that the threat of capital punishment, and indeed the threat of corporal punishment—or perhaps I should put it the other way round on this clause—have some deterrent effect. I do not think that they can fail to, and I do not think that one could fail to say that if we were to threaten capital or corporal punishment—and I only intend to be flippant in order to highlight the point— for some trivial offence like parking, it would have a dramatic effect on the number of parking offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the point eloquently made by my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mr. Clark) that when we are discussing the question and level of deterrents, we have to consider who we are seeking to deter against what and we have to get the balance right. Although we are unquestionably seeking to 'deter people from some disgusting and abominable offences which deserve severe punishment, I do not think that the statistics establish that there is a sufficiently clear deterrent effect to justify it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By far the most cogent statistics quoted today are those showing what the courts have chosen to do over the fifty years of this century when they had the power to inflict corporal punishment. The statistic quoted by my hon. and learned Friend the Minister in detail and adverted to by the hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon) shows that at the beginning of the century corporal punishment was used for 3,300 cases and that this had dropped, even before the war, to only approximately 100 cases in a different climate even from today. After the war the tide moved inexorably away to just a handful of cases. That statistic is cogent in guiding us on what we should do when we consider imposing it once again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No country in the Western world thinks that corporal punishment is an appropriate penalty. It has been in decline in the Western world for 100 to 150 years, for the reasons which have been well argued. When we see in the newspapers occasionally floggings from Pakistan published in photographs, we do not get the impression from the public—I know that the Pakistanis are much more severe than what is proposed here—that they think that that is the sort of penalty which they wish to see re-imposed in our society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although that may be a little unfair on my hon. Friends' views, because there is such a major difference in quality, it is a fact that corporal punishment is not used in the Western world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some experience of legal cases from the Far East. Some countries which send their cases to a final court of appeal in our own Judicial Committee of the Privy Council still employ corporal punishment. I confess that nothing that I have seen or heard from those cases gives me to believe that even in the different circumstances of their society is it a particularly effective deterrent, It is certainly known to be available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>767</span>
but, of course, against a background of much more severe penalties generally than we have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of my hon. Friends in reimposing corporal punishment is that it should have some beneficial overall effect on the number of crimes, on the powers of the courts and on the respect in which the courts are held. I fear that it might not have that effect. We know only too well from our press—and possibly from the press who are here to listen to the debate—the interest in corporal punishment which is shown in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Magistrates who would impose corporal punishment and police stations where it would be carried out would find themselves the centres of the sort of attention which nobody in this Committee would feel enhances respect for law and order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is my clear impression that there might be an interest in the subject and the sort of demonstrations which I deplore, but which are increasing, particularly in schools, outside such courts and police stations would have a thoroughly counter-productive effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In summary, although in the past, as civilisation has developed in this country, corporal punishment undoubtedly had a place—a declining place—I should like to quote the words of Lord Denning. To be accurate I am not quoting, 1 am recalling what he says in his autobiography. He is a man of great age and has lived through the entire period that we have been discussing in the debate—the whole of this century and slightly longer I think. He points out that while corporal punishment was commonplace when he was a boy and it was still in force when he came onto the bench, there was once an occasion when he felt it right to sentence a male adult offender to be flogged. He thought at the time that it was right, but the punishment was then abolished and I think his words were roughly, "Those days are gone and a good thing too."
<br><br><!-- lb -->

We wish to see, and the whole object of the Bill is to see, that we take a firm, imaginative, flexible and wide-ranging approach to the problems of law and order, giving the courts all the necessary and appropriate powers that we can and making sure that the police have the strength, equipment and the political and public backing to do their work, and we will not enhance that by reintroducing corporal punishment in the Bill. For that reason I shall vote against the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Jo Richardson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall detain the Committee only for a couple of minutes because we have had, over the course of this morning, this afternoon and the early evening, a very thoughtful debate and there is little to add. Some of the speeches will be worth reading in years to come, particularly if I may say so with great humility, the speech of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) whose speech will bear reading for many years to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make two points. The first one is in a way a question to the mover of the new clause. I have tried to follow him as closely as I could and I understood the thrust of his argument was that people who are involved in muggings, and the range of crimes that he described, should be subjected to the treatment that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>768</span>
would be involved in the new clause if it were passed. I do not understand why he restricts that new punishment to people under 18 and to males.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not make a flippant point about sex equality, but the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mr. Hawksley) talked about thi violence of boys and girls and I wonder what it is—perhaps it is some saving grace in the soul of the hon. Gentleman—that makes him stop short of whipping girls, when he is perfectly prepared to whip boys. That is not to say that I support what he was saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend not agree that it is more illogical in view of the fact that the hon. Gentleman presumably supports corporal punishment in schools and there it is inflicted upon girls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Richardson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, my hon. Friend makes a very good point. I also ask the hon. Member for The Wrekin, and other hon. Gentlemen who support the new clause, whether they would be prepared to inflict corporal punishment. I appreciate that the clause calls for a constable to do so. I would have hoped that in the unlikely event of the clause being passed, and I sincerely hope it will not be, that a constable who is called upon to do this would be given the option of refusing and that there would be no sanction against such a person if he or she decided to refuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I have discussed the topic with people who are not Members of Parliament they have, in a rather vague and woolly way, called for the return of capital punishment or the return of flogging or whatever, and I have asked them if they would personally hang somebody, or whip somebody. In most cases they have said that they could not do it and that would be the reaction of the majority of people I should like to know whether hon. Gentlemen who support the new clause are passing the responsibility for carrying out the intention of the clause to other people, which is an easy option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am totally opposed to violence from wherever it comes and I have been thinking about it very carefully this morning and this afternoon. I do not think that I could support the new clause even if evidence was produced that it was a deterrent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I oppose violence from the sort of inadvertent violence of excited and unruly kids at a football match, because basically that is what they are, through to muggers. None of us wants mugging to continue, but there are other ways of trying to deal with it by policing methods. I do not even like corporal punishment at home because to me corporal punishment at home can lead, and in some cases has led, to what can be described as battering, as distinct from caning. I know that there is a temptation on the part of parents to give their children a clip over the earhole from time to time, but some violent parents beat their children. There is not a great deal of difference—it is a very narrow line—between using the cane or the hand at home in a very hard way and inflicting real violence on children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I oppose most of all the perpetrators of really calculated and organised violent crime, but in a way they do not fall within the category that we are discussing, because they are not normally under 18. I also oppose State violence. I do not think the State should be violent in return, however violent the person who is being punished has been. That tends to make violence legiti

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>769</span>
mate. It should be the role of the State to try to pursue a policy that outlaws violence. I believe that if the State sets an example, at least some of the people may follow. We should make all violence illegitimate and we should start by setting that example ourselves in Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I intend to support my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Mr. Hawksley) and I will try to explain why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not yet been fully convinced by the arguments of those who are opposed to the new clause. We have heard of two reports. The first was the Cadogan report of 1938. Bearing in mind that corporal punishment was abolished in 1948, the next report that we had was in 1960 —22 years after the first report and some 12 years after corporal punishment was abolished. A further 22 years has elapsed since that second report. I submit that evidence taken that long ago is not up to date, and I believe that it is of paramount importance to have up-to-date evidence in considering the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Kilroy-Silk 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ormskirk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure what the hon. Gentleman is talking about. The evidence that was in the Cadogan report, for example, related to the years when corporal punishment was available as an option to the courts. We cannot have any more up-to-date evidence than that. Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that we should take evidence from 1948 onwards, when corporal punishment was not available as an option?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bendall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am suggesting that we should take evidence from people who have to deal with the law, from the police who have to deal with youngsters and other offenders. We should take evidence of their views at the present time, as against the appalling crimes of violence that we have seen in the past few weeks. That is where I want to begin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One cannot deny that in the past two or three years we have seen an extraordinary increase in crimes of extreme violence. What disturbs and perturbs me particularly is the type of crimes of violence being perpetrated by young people. We see instances today of young people of 17 or 18 raping women of 75 or 80. Those are not crimes of violence that I recall happening when I was a young man and I believe that such crimes have not been happening in this country for the past 200 or 300 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am trying to say to the Committee is that not only are the types of violence and crimes that we are seeing greatly on the increase, but the crimes being perpetrated by younger people are I believe becoming much more serious and more repugnant to the general public. That is why a large majority of the public is calling for the return of corporal punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one examines some of the opinion polls carried out over recent years, one cannot get away from the fact that there have been calls for corporal punishment to be applied in certain instances. I subscribe to the view that such instances should be few, because I have always believed that, whether in the home or the school, if corporal punishment is to be meaningful it should not be delivered 	<i>ad infinitum</i> at every whim and turn, but used sparingly for very serious crimes or activities committed by younger persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>770</span>
That brings me to my second point about the school and the home. For many years I have held the view that corporal punishment used sparingly is a way of teaching young people the difference between right and wrong. I am most disappointed at the outcome of the European Court of Human Rights because we are literally hanging on the word "degrading". Arguments about torture and inhumanity, which one would have thought would logically have been applied to corporal punishment, were accepted by the court, but it is on the word "degrading" that we are hanging. I tell the Committee frankly that if somebody has committed a serious crime of violence against another, often against an elderly person, I could not care less if corporal punishment proved degrading for that offender. I believe that such offenders need to be degraded for their crimes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not say that I believe in torture—of course, I do not. I believe in human rights. The hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) laughs, but what is at stake is the word "degrading" because the court found in no other way in respect of human rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that there may be a difference between inflicting punishment which is degrading on an individual and a form of judicial punishment which is degrading to society as a whole?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bendall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it depends upon the stance one adopts when deciding what is degrading to society as a whole. I certainly accept that flogging in public, which is carried out in some mid-eastern countries, is degrading to a society. However, the proposer of the new clause made no suggestion that flogging should be carried out in public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to deal with a matter raised by the hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon) and the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin). I fully agree with their comments about the criminal statistics that were recently published involving blacks and whites. I do not see why there should be a distinction between the two. I believe that the published figures should show all the ethnic breakdowns and I said so in my constituency a few days ago. The breakdowns should be shown and it is wrong simply to publish statistics showing a breakdown between blacks and whites.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich made an important and lasting contribution and I hope that it will be taken on board. I also hope that in future the figures will be published in the way suggested by the right hon. and learned Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the argument that unemployment has caused the rise in crime over recent years. I willingly accept the notion that some idle hands may turn to crime because of unemployment—that is inevitable. But I certainly do not accept that argument as an explanation of why crimes committed by the young have risen dramatically, because the greatest percentage in that group are those who are still at school. One cannot argue that young people still at school are unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that this country has been the leader in human rights, but the past few years have produced a gathering of crimes of violence the like of which has not been seen in our history.

The hon. Gentleman has expressed to the Committee the concern of each Opposition Member about the increased incidence of crime.

The hon. Member for Nantwich made great play about the need to retain corporal punishment—to bring it back as an option in judicial sentencing, and to retain it in schools and the home. He tried to pretend that Labour Members went along with him.

I wish to make it perfectly clear that I do not believe that it is necessary to have corporal punishment in the home or in school. I cannot accept that it is right and proper for an adult to visit premeditated violence on a child. Any adult who feels he should do that, whether in school as a teacher, or as a parent, has clearly failed as an individual to deal with his problems or those of the child that he is brutalising. The experience of teachers in the factory-like comprehensive schools in my constituency, which are in some of the worst social areas in the United Kingdom is that it is not necessary to use corporal punishment; nor has it been used in the past decade or longer. Their testimony, public and

private, clearly gives the lie to all the arguments advanced by Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been debating the issue for five hours. That is almost as long as we shall debate all the issues which will concern members of the Committee, and the public, when we debate law and order on Thursday. We have debated for almost six hours a subject that is totally irrelevant to all the country's needs and problems. What is worse, not only is it irrelevant, but it is highly irresponsible of Conservative Members to introduce the new clause and to suggest outside the House that it is a simple, easy, glib solution to the problem of increasing crime. Clearly it is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mr. Hawksley) who has not figured in any of our debates on other issues, although he professes to be very concerned about the increase in crime—this is our 22nd sitting and he has not been predominant in earlier debates— will bear a heavy responsibility for misleading genuinely concerned members of the public who are afraid of what they perceive as increasing crime and who are led to believe by people such as the hon. Gentleman that there is a simple, easy option and that but for the failure of the Committee to accept the new clause all their fears about crime, both adult and juvenile, would be dealt with. That is not the case. It is not the simple answer arid certainly whipping children is not the answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been three official research reports already this century comparing the subsequent records of offenders who received corporal punishment before its abolition in 1948 with those of similar offenders who were dealt with differently. Two have been mentioned— the Board of Education report that was published in 1920 on juvenile offenders who had been birched, the report of the departmental committee on corporal punishment, otherwise referred to as the Cadogan committee, published in 1938, and the survey by the Home Office research unit of people convicted of robbery with violence between 1941 and 1948, the results of which were published in 1960. All three surveys have shown clearly and convincingly that a higher proportion of the offenders who received corporal punishment committed further offences than those who did not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Lyell) says that he believes that corporal punishment has some deterrent value. He is entitled to that belief. Whether it is sustainable on the basis of the evidence does not matter. I go along with him in that belief, but the evidence available is that other penalties have greater deterrent value. Birching does not deter offenders as much as other custodial and non-custodial measures that have been applied in the past. As the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendall), who has left the Room, said, that is the evidence of the three major reports of the century.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we consider the evidence of the use of corporal punishment for the crime of robbery and violence some peculiar statistics come out. Before it was abolished, the number of robberies with violence known to the police rose steadily. In 1946 there were 804 crimes of robbery with violence; in 1947 there were
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0564">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>773</span>
842 and in 1948 there were 978. In the three years after the abolition of corporal punishment for such crimes they fell to 860 in 1949, 812 in 1950 and 633 in 1951. On that basis, if we are considering the alleged deterrent effect, it would seem sensible not to introduce corporal punishment or birching—or whipping as it is legally known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the debate has been important for more than that reason. We have distracted not only the public and the media but ourselves from the real issue of the increase in crime—though the increase does not justify the hysterical lengths that some Conservative Members and the press have gone to. Only a small minority of the crimes committed either in the metropolitan area by blacks, coloured or others, or elsewhere in the country, involve crimes of robbery, sex or violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been heard about an alleged increase in juvenile crime. That has been such an increase over the past 10 years. It has not increased significantly faster than the increase in adult crime and, strange though it may seem, during two years of the lifetime of the previous Labour Government the rate of increase in juvenile crime declined. Leaving all that aside, only 7 per cent, of the crime committed by juveniles involved robbery, sex or violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether we are talking about adults or juveniles— tonight we are concerned with juveniles—violent offenders are a tiny minority. They may be despicable, and are to be condemned, but they are a minority and, not the large marauding groups portrayed by Conservative Members as part and parcel of everyday life in our cities. Those Members do not do themselves or the public real service by suggesting that we are beset by major crimes of violence and that all our cities are threatened with a breakdown of law and order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, that is not true. The evidence produced by Age Concern shows conclusively the unfortunate effects of such misleading and hysterical campaigns on elderly citizens. The mythology bears no relation to the facts. Its proponents have distracted attention not only from the real problems of increases in crime, but from the real causes of crime. Once again they are attempting to deal with the symptoms rather than identifying and isolating the causes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt about the evidence. An analysis of the backgrounds of the boys at Send detention centre during one year was produced by the medical officer of that centre and published in the winter 1978 edition of the 	<i>Prison Medical Journal.</i> Presumably those boys are exactly the sort who would be subjected to judicial whipping if the new clause were adopted. The analysis showed clearly that they came from broken homes. Their parents were alcoholics, had left home, broken up, were in prison and all the rest. Their history was one of neglect, of absence of social skills, education and training. Those were the problems that needed to be dealt with if any of those boys were to have any semblance of a chance of becoming constructive law-abiding members of the community. Such problems cannot be dealt with by subjecting boys to the degrading barbarity of the measure proposed by the hon. Member for The Wrekin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative hon. Members bear a great responsibility for the increase in crime.
	<br><q><p>"There has been a dramatic rise in unemployment among boys and girls. That is the responsibility of this Government. Let no
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>774</span>
one have any doubt about the danger that that has created in terms of crime of all sorts, violence and vandalism. If boys and girls do not obtain jobs when they leave school, they feel that society has no need of them. If they feel that, they do not see any reason why they should take part in that society and comply with its rules. That is what is happening and, wherever we sit in this House, that is what we have to recognise."</p></q>
Those are not my words but those of the present Home Secretary, speaking on 27 February 1978 when unemployment was less than 1 million. He went on, at the end of that beautiful and, I am sure, in future, much-quoted paragraph:
	<br><q><p>"There are also deteriorating living conditions in urban areas which until recently the Government did nothing about. That is another reason for the increase in crime."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 27 February 1978; Vol. 945, c. 40.]</p>
	<p>7.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am finding it difficult to reconcile what the hon. Gentleman is now saying to the new clause before us, which deals with corporal punishment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to explain, Mr. Dean. If we are dealing with punishment, we must also try to identify the causes of crime. In some cases, it may be more sensible if we have—as presumably we all have— the same objective of reducing the level of crime, to debate whether it is more sensible to punish and, if so, whether by birching, or whether it is more appropriate to try to identify and eliminate the causes of crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that no Conservative Members wish to take issue with me on whether the cause of crime is unemployment or social conditions. It is strange how, suddenly, when one says that those are not one's own words but the words of a Tory Home Secretary, they become more legitimate and more respectable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Home Secretary was right. He made those comments in 1978 and they are equally valid now. If we want to deal with crime, we should deal with its social causes, particularly unemployment, inadequate housing, bad education and lack of parental responsibility. We cannot and should not deal with it by the barbaric and degrading method proposed in the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Miss Richardson) is quite right. This is a degrading and barbaric punishment which disfigures any society making any pretence of being civilised and compassionate. Like her, I would oppose it, even if it could be demonstrated to have a deterrent effect. As it is, there is no evidence that whipping is a deterrent. All the evidence suggests that it is not a deterrent, and we all accept and acknowledge that it is barbaric and degrading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for The Wrekin has not been able to demonstrate in the least that his proposal would reduce the level of crime or the recidivist rate. He has been able to demonstrate clearly, in the minute detail of the new clause, that this would 'be a barbaric, dehumanising and degrading punishment. For that reason, 1, like my right hon. and hon. Friends, will vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I came to this debate in what is, for me, an unusual condition—with an open mind. I have taken
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1981-1982V001P0I0565">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>775</span>
a second unusual stance in that I have made up my mind on the basis of the arguments that I have heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends have been brave to put forward the new clause. They have argued it vigorously and I congratulate them. But I have not been convinced, as I had thought that I might be, that they are right. Therefore, despite the strong temptation to prove to my hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) that whipping is no deterrent, I must support my hon. and learned Friend the Minister in resisting the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawksley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to detain the Committee for long, but may I first thank members of the Committee for giving the new clause such a fair hearing? It has been a good and genuine debate, which we do not always see to the extent that we have today. I have no regrets, either, that it has taken a whole day to deal with the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the argument of the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) that there is no simple solution. I never said, when I proposed the clause, that it alone would halt and cure the crime statistics that we have seen rising so fast. I believe that it would help. It is in that spirit that I believe we should consider the proposal. I do not believe that any one proposal on its own would win the fight that we are having against the unruly elements in society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we vote on the new clause, I believe that we should think of the victims. Many of them are our constituents. I believe that they would feel that, by supporting the new clause, we have tried to ensure that they are that much safer in future. I believe that corporal punishment is a deterrent. Some admitted that possibly it was a deterrent while others said that they did not believe that it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Barking (Miss Richardson) challenged me to say whether I would carry out the punishment myself. I believe that the answer is that while I do not particularly want to be a bus driver or a lorry driver, they may be jobs that I might do at some future stage and I have no principles against doing such jobs. In the same way, one would not have personal objections to being a hangman if one believes that capital pinishment is a necessary punishment that should be brought back. Therefore, the answer to the hon. Lady is that one would be prepared to administer that punishment if it were necessary. It will be noted that new clause 44(6) states that the punishment shall be inflicted by
	<br><q><p>"a constable or by some other person appointed by the Court".</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>776</span>
Therefore, if a policeman felt that he did not want to inflict that punishment, the court would have the facility to provide another person to carry out the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could be voting on a matter of principle the principle of whether we believe that corporal punishment should be brought back in certain instances. I believe that if the new clause were accepted, we could deal with questions of appeal, time limits and the categories to be covered. I think that it is accepted that crimes of violence would be most appropriate for corporal punishment and I would be only too willing to see the Government reduce on Report the categories that I have specified if it was accepted for crimes of violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that the Minister did not offer an inquiry. My hon. Friends the Members for Belper (Mr. Faith) and Carshalton (Mr. Forman) said that while they would not vote for the new clause they could see advantages in having an inquiry. If we do not win the vote, I shall continue to press the Government to try to persuade them to hold such an inquiry because I believe that it would be helpful to everybody to know on independent evidence whether there would be advantage in having corporal punishment restored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that as a result of the Minister's response I must ask my hon. Friends to support me in the motion. I believe that the serious increase in crime warrants serious action and that our constituents would want us to vote for the measure. I also believe that we would be offering them and the victims of crime a future in which life would be better, so I ask my hon. Friends to support the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
