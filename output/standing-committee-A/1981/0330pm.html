	<div class='title'>POWER TO REVIEW THE SENTENCE OF A FINE DEFAULTER INSTEAD OF COMMITTING HIM TO PRISON</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"Where, after the occasion of an offender's conviction, a court has the power to issue a warrant committing him to prison for a default in paying a fine, the court may deal with him for the offence in respect of which the fine was imposed in any manner in which it it could deal with him if it had just convicted him of that offence."—[	<i>Mr. Dubs.</i>]</p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a fairly modest proposals and it is intended to give the courts the power to review the sentence in those cases where someone on whom a fine was originally imposed has not paid that fine and would, under present circumstances, be committed to prison. The intention is that the courts would have the power to review the sentence in the hope of avoiding a prison sentence for all the individuals in that category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to give a somewhat dramatic example of something that happened earlier this year when a magistrates' court in Dewsbury sentenced a mother of five to prison because she was not able to pay £55 in penalties as a consequence of not having a licence for her television set. Mercifully, the local church collected the money so that the woman in question spent only a short period in gaol. Nevertheless, she was sent there basically because of what seems to us to be a trivial matter and certainly not one demanding a custodial sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I do not have any figures on how often this happens, I am assured that that instance was not an isolated one. According to the local paper for the area, one of the magistrates said that he would send pregnant women to prison if that was the only way they could get the money from them. When the lady who was sentenced to custody had originally been fined for not having a television licence, she had been in hospital expecting a baby. It appears that she had been in hospital for about three months and her husband had not wanted to tell her about the fine because he did not wish to upset her. Shortly after she came out of hospital she found herself back in court and sentenced to gaol.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the majority of fine defaulters are not of that kind—or I certainly hope that they are not of that kind. However, there are many of them. In 1979, more that 17,000 fine defaulters were received into prison. That comprises nearly a quarter of all the people who were received into custody as part of their sentence. The figures for 1980 are rather more difficult to pin down because of the prison officers' dispute, but until the autumn of that year when the dispute began there was an increase in fine defaulters sent to prison of 14 per cent, over the year before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>850</span>
I am aware that the sentences are usually not all that long. Indeed, in 1979 nearly a quarter of all those fine defaulters sent to prison were sent for a period of up to one week. Just under a third were sent to prison for between two weeks and one month, but almost one in 10 was sent to prison for between two and six months. That is quite a large number sent for what is a pretty long period of time when the courts had originally not intended a custodial sentence at all. But, because the average sentence of a fine defaulter sent to prison is relatively short, they accounted for 2.5 per cent, of the sentenced population or just under 1,000 out of nearly 37,000. The prison population is larger than that because people are also remanded in custody, which brings the numbers up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the fine defaulters sentenced to prison are males—in 1979 over 16,000 compared with just under 1,000 who were females. A fair proportion are in the 17 to 20-year-old category—just over 2,000 of them are between these ages. What have they originally done to attract the fine which in the end they have not paid? Looking at the males only in 1979, the largest category to be given fines leading to a prison sentence for a fine default because of theft, handling, fraud and forgery was some 4,500. Motoring offences was the second largest category, 3,000, and drunkenness, 2,400.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 59 of the Criminal Law Act 1977 reduced the maximum period in prison that the court could set in default of a given amount of fine. That had the result that the group which was given the longest prison sentences as a consequence of fine default—that is, a two to six-month sentence—was reduced from 30 per cent, of the total to 9 per cent, after the Act came into force. However, there is still quite a large number who are sentenced to fairly long periods of imprisonment for a fine default.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is my purpose in moving this new clause to encourage the courts to look for alternatives to prison in the case of fine defaulters. At the moment only one alternative sentence can be imposed. That is an attendance centre order for those under 21, but this is seldom used or considered by the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Criminal Justice Act 1972 provided for community service orders for fine defaulters, but this section of that Act has not been implemented and, therefore, cannot be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence is that in quite a number of instances, after a fine has been imposed, there has been a change of circumstances affecting the person fined which makes it more difficult for him or her to pay the fine. A Home Office research study called "Fines in Magistrates Courts" suggested, on the basis of a sample survey, that 29 per cent, of defaulters had had changes in their circumstances after the fine had been imposed which made it more difficult for them to pay the fine. That is one of the main reasons why there are so many fine defaulters. This proposal, which is a modest one, might go some way towards reducing the prison population, although not by very large numbers. The people who are in prison through fine defauls are there not through the direct wish of the courts in the first instance, otherwise a custodial sentence would have been imposed at the outset, but because they have either not been willing to pay the fine or, in many cases, not been able to pay the fine or found great difficulty in doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>851</span>
This modest proposal is one which should commend itself to the Committee, and I hope that the Minister will see his way to accepting it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I warmly agree with what the hon. Gentleman has just said. Fine defaulters who end up in prison, albeit for only a short space of time in the majority of cases, find themselves in a place where it was not the original intention of the court that they should go. We all agree and have expressed our agreement in the past in this Committee that it must only be a matter of last resort that a fine defaulter should go to prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have observed in the course of our earlier proceedings that Parliament has already written into statute law some very considerable safeguards with the purpose of ensuring that it is only as a last resort, and as an ultimate sanction, that the power to imprison shall be used. Therefore, we must bear this in mind when examining the new clause that the hon. Gentleman has very helpfully tabled and extremely fairly and lucidly explained this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We sympathise with his purpose of encouraging courts to find an alternative to custody for defaulters, but listening to his account of the matter I do not think he gives sufficient weight to the fact that the courts have to be satisfied that there was wilful default or culpable neglect to pay the fine before they can send someone to prison in default.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor, I thought, did he give sufficient weight to the procedures which oblige them to consider whether there ought to be a review of means, whether the amount of the fine or the instalment order should be considered, and so on. The effect of the new clause would be to enable courts to carry out a review of the sentence instead of committing a fine defaulter to prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, I think, common ground that not very many fine defaulters actually go to prison once the warrant of committal has been issued, but this new clause carries the danger of the reverse effect to that intended by the hon. Gentleman, namely, increasing the length of time spent in prison by fine defaulters. It could come about in this way. An offender convicted of theft in a magistrates' court, for example, would be liable to a maximum penalty of six months' imprisonment or a fine of £1,000 or both. He may have been fined £200, in the event, and if he refused to pay until the point where a court had no alternative but to consider a warrant of committal, the maximum number of days he could spend in prison is only 30. That is the maximum permitted in relation to a fine of £200 in the table of imprisonment in default in schedule 4 to the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980. If, as this new clause would provide, a court could sentence the offender for his original offence, what is there to prevent it from imposing the original option of six months' imprisonment, or in any case for a term longer than 30 days?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One could devise a solution. The new clause could be extended to exclude custodial sentences from any review of sentence. The court would still have the option of sending the defaulter to prison for the usual default term, but this would not, I think, be satisfactory for a number of reasons. We must consider what such a limited review of sentence would enable a court to do. It could give the fine defaulter an abosute or conditional
	<span class='label label-info column'>852</span>
discharge. I doubt very much whether it would so so. It is likely to be regarded as far too soft an option for an offender who has defaulted through what would have been found to be culpable neglect or wilful refusal to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should add that an offender who has defaulted through no fault of his own can also have his fine wholly or partly remitted, and is not liable to imprisonment. There are also probation and community service orders available, but such orders are hardly likely to be suitable for offenders who have already proved their unwillingness to follow the court's direction, notwithstanding that they were able to do so. The circumstances of the offence would once again be considered. Probation officers would have to report on the candidate's suitability. Even the potentially-suitable offenders might not agree to an order, and a small but troublesome proportion of deliberate fine defaulters seem to be determined to go to prison to make a point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) the other day gave an example of that from his own experience as a Member of Parliament and an advocate. A few might succeed in fulfilling their obligations to the court and to society in this way but the rest, I fear, would be back full circle, having their sentence reviewed once again as a consequence of the probation order or community service order. Imprisonment would be the final resort, as it is intended to be at the moment, but after a delay incurring much more work for the courts, and possibly also for agencies such as the probation service, and much greater cost to the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also, it is not clear how sentence reviews would take account of offenders who had partly paid off their fines. Should Crown courts spend their time reviewing the sentences of fine defaulters whom they had sentenced, or should magistrates' courts be given the power to alter as well as to enforce sentences imposed by the Crown court? One should also bear in mind that there has yet to be found a more effective way of securing payment of a fine than an immediate or a suspended warrant of committal. We should be wary of further diluting the deterrent powers of the fine enforcement procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon), who is not here today, spoke convincingly at our last sitting, with the experience of a former Home Office Minister, of the fact that the power to imprison as a last resort secures the payment of a large proportion of maintenance orders which have been in default, and the experience in relation to fines is not dissimilar. Therefore, while I wholly understand and sympathise with the object behind the new clause proposed by the hon. Gentleman, in the vast majority of cases it would serve only to postpone the time but not to avoid it when a warrant of committal would be issued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That being the case, we cannot neglect the substantial extra work both for the court and the probation service that would ensue, the time that would elapse and the expense to the taxpayer. These considerations oblige the Government to take the view that this new clause should not be included in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>REDUCTION IN THE MAXIMUM LENGTH OF PROBATION ORDERS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"In section 2(1) of the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973, the words 'three years' shall be omitted and the words 'two years' shall be inserted."—[	<i>Mr. Parris.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Parris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the new clause is to reduce the maximum length of probation orders. I put it forward in a tentative spirit, awaiting my hon. and learned Friend's reply before I decide whether to persist with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Criminal Law Act 1977 reduced the minimum length of a probation order to six months, and section 57 gave the Home Secretary the power to change the minimum and maximum periods. This is a power which he has never yet used and I invite the Committee to consider whether it is now time for him to exercise his power to reduce the maximum period of probation from three years to two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Current wisdom advocates the use of shorter periods of supervision. The figures indicate that the courts have been prepared already to move a good way in that direction. The probation statistics for 1980 show that only 2,137 offenders were placed on probation orders for periods longer than two years. That represents 6 per cent, of the total orders made during that year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decreasing use of longer orders is shown by the fact that in 1971, nine years previously, 8,681 such orders were made—27 per cent, of the orders made in that year. There has been a corresponding increase in the use of short orders. In 1980, 30 per cent, of orders were for one year or less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a consensus in the probation service that supervision should be purposeful and aim at the achievement of identifiable goals within a reasonable time span. Commonly, the first few months of a probation order is the period in which most work is done with probationers, and in most cases any beneficial effect will be achieved within that period. A shorter order may help to preserve some momentum and more successfully enlist the active commitment of the probationer to tackle problems and to achieve change. To put it at its lowest, if nothing has been achieved within two years there is probably not much point in carrying on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that probation officers can apply to the courts for discharge of orders of any length before they have run their full course. However, this would not be normal before the order was between a half and two-thirds complete. Even in that case, discharge can normally be sought only on grounds of positive progress. The National Association of Probation Officers believes that some orders are left to run their full course for a variety of inadequate reasons, when little more can be achieved, and that this is not a very effective use of scarce probation resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>854</span>
Finally, Mr. Dean, I remind the Committee that when offenders are placed on probation they remain liable for the duration of the order to be sentenced for the original offence should they re-offend. At present, though, a suspended sentence can be imposed for up to two years where as a probation order can be for up to three years so the period of jeopardy of being re-sentenced, so to speak, extends for three years if one is on a probation order and two years if one is given an ordinary suspended sentence. The Committee may think this rather anomalous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that this change would not materially affect the courts' sentencing powers but would assist good practice in the probation service and simply give legislative effect to changes which are already taking place in sensible practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had evidence given me by the National Association of Probation Officers. I have heard their side of the story, I have not heard my hon. and learned Friends' view and I shall await that view before I make up my own mind on whether to persist with this new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Shirley Summerskill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I support what the hon. Gentleman has said, that we have a situation where the minimum length of orders has been reduced but the maximum length has remained three years. In practice, I understand that courts make relatively few orders that are longer than two years. Therefore, is this not the time to reduce it to a maximum of two years?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been said, we are always told that any good which will be achieved from supervision will have been achieved or not within the period of two years. Increasing the time only puts more work upon the probation officers with apparently less effect resulting. Lastly, if this change was incorporated in the Bill, it would have the advantage of making the maximum period for which a person based on probation is liable to be dealt with for the original offence the same as the maximum one for which a sentence of imprisonment can be suspended, that is, two years. For all these reason, I support what the hon. Gentleman has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving us the opportunity to discuss the present maximum duration of a probation order and for the way in which he has moved his new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment that is tabled would reduce the statutory maximum from three years to two. I am sure it is generally agreed that probation orders should run no longer than is necessary for the offender to gain any benefits that supervision may yield. Therefore, one naturally sympathises with many of the things that my hon. Friend has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But on the other hand, I feel it is very important that we should not do anything to diminish the attraction to courts of probation orders as a means of disposing of a criiminal case. If it were the case that the period between two years and three years was virtually never used by courts today when making a probation order, I would certainly feel able to take a different view towards this new clause than I am at the moment. But quite a significant number of cases still appear in which the courts make an order more than two years, and I think it must follow from that that the probation order as a disposal would appear, in a significant number of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0611">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>855</span>
cases, to be less attractive to the courts and the courts would therefore be less likely to use it and more likely to use, for example, a custodial disposal if we were to accede to my hon. Friend's suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman says quite a significant number of orders are made for a period of more than two years, but probation officers say that relatively few orders are. May we perhaps have some numbers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the number was 2,100 in 1980. That is relatively fewer than nine years earlier in 1971 when 8,700 persons were given orders of longer than two years. In 1980, the number was down to 2,100. It is therefore a diminishing number, and I think that we may see this trend continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment I do not believe that any hardship or wrong exists in maintaining the present maximum. There has been a decline, too, in the proportionate use of longer orders. In 1971, nearly 27 per cent, of persons given orders were placed on probation for more than two years, compared with just over 6 per cent, in 1980.1 suggest therefore that the figures demonstrate a growing awareness on the part of the courts and the probation service that a short or medium-length order can be just as effective as a long one. It has been one of the recurring themes of our deliberations that maximum flexibility should be retained for the courts in deciding how to dispose of offenders, within certain parameters which we have thought it right to lay down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have, for example, thought it right to say that there must be tight restrictions on the power of the courts to send somebody to prison or into custody of any sort, if he or she is under 21. Here, however, we are talking only about whether a court may make a probation order for as long as three years, or whether the maximum should be limited to two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that there is a fairly important distinction in principle between the sentence of imprisonment, which is what a suspended sentence is, and an order that somebody shall submit to the supervision of a probation officer for a given time. I do not believe that because we say that the maximum period over which a sentence of imprisonment may be suspended is two years, that we are therefore logically led to say that the same should be the maximum period for a probation order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that it is a question of judgment in each case, and courts in more than 2,000 cases in 1980, evidently still thought it right, at any rate at the time of making the order, to say that it should persist for three years. We must assume that the courts clearly took into account the power to make an order of shorter duration but felt that that the circumstances of the offence, if not the offender, rendered it desirable that the order should so as far as three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the trend to which I referred, the courts still find a three-year order a useful option in certain cases. Therefore, as I said, it would be contrary to our entire approach to the Bill to limit the flexibility of the courts by depriving them of a disposal which they may find helpful in dealing with difficult cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider as well how the 2,000 or so offenders who in 1980 were put on probation for more than two years would have been dealt with if the courts
	<span class='label label-info column'>856</span>
had been restricted to making a two-year order. I do not think that we can confidently assume that all would have been given short-term orders. We cannot rule out the possibility that some of them would have received custodial sentences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we give our minds to the type of circumstances that must have accounted for a fair number of those 2,100 cases in 1980, there must have been a reasonable proportion in which the court said "It is borderline whether you go into a form of custody. We feel that we can take a lenient course, but we must ensure that you are subject to supervision for a longer rather than a shorter time". My guess is that a fair proportion of those cases fell into that category.

The statutory framework of the probation order ought to remain as wide and flexible asjpossible. Within the framework there are arrangements designed to ensure that probation orders are not continued for longer than they need be. The majority are made following a favourable assessment in a social inquiry report prepared by a probation officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1974, the Home Office, with the support of the then Lord Chief Justice, encouraged probation officers to suggest a specific term for an order when offering advice to the courts on the suitability of an offender for probation. This advice still stands, and so, if a probation officer considers that a short period of probation will suffice in a particular case, he is quite free to say so, and he will help the court if he does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also open to probation officers, or to probationers themselves, to apply to the court to have an order discharged early, as my hon. Friend has fairly reminded us, or replaced by a conditional discharge, if they believe that the order has achieved its purpose within the original term. In fact, about one-fifth of the three-year orders which terminated in 1980 were discharged either because the probationer had made good or because the court substituted a conditional discharge. Probation officers are encouraged to review the progress of orders regularly, particularly the longer ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is every opportunity for probation orders to be terminated when they have served their purpose, and that is a matter of some significance. The fact that this is not just available on the statute book but that in one-fifth of the cases of three-year orders which terminated in 1980 that power to curtail at a later stage was actually used, should be of substantial reassurance to my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trend towards shorter orders may well continue, and eventually the courts may cease altogether to make use of orders for longer than two years. If that were to happen, there would be a case for bringing the law into line with sentencing practice, but a future Home Secretary could do this by exercising the powers conferred on him by the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973 to vary the statutory maximum and minimum lengths of probation orders. This would be subject to affirmative resolution of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are here in much the same position as we shall be when we discuss maximum sentences later on, if we reach that new clause—namely, whether we ought to cut back the maximum in order to ensure that a shorter average length of order or sentence should be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have managed to persuade my hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0612">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>857</span>
Friend and the Committee that at present we have not reached the position in which so little use is made of the power to order a probation order to extend up to three years, that we ought to do away with the power to sentence, or that we ought to reduce the maximum. We have not, I am certain, reached that stage yet. The courts still find the three-year order a useful option in a not insubstantial number of cases. We ought not to take that power from them. I therefore hope that in the light of this explanation of how the power is operated at present, my hon. Friend will feel it right to withdraw his new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. and learned Friend for his careful reply to the case that I put forward. I was encouraged by what he said about the trend towards shorter orders, and I note that he does not rule out the possibility that when that trend is even more firmly established, and even fewer of the longer orders are being given, the Home Secretary may invoke the powers that he already has to reduce the maximum length of probation orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He was right to say that a significant number of orders are still the three-year order. The hon. Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) was also right to say that there were relatively few. Six per cent, is relatively few, but it is significant. Clearly, in 6 per cent, of the cases the courts still think that this sentence is appropriate. Equally clearly, probation officers, whose task it is to supervise these orders, think that it is not appropriate, and that they are more or less wasting their time for the third of those two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the resolution to this paradox probably lies in the fact that the courts, in imposing that sentence, have a somewhat punitive element in mind, and three years sounds a somewhat more severe sentence than two years, whereas probation officers simply have the rehabilitative element in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, I was impressed by the argument of my hon and learned Friend about the need not to diminish the attraction for probation orders so far as the courts were concerned, and I must accept what he said that we must not assume that courts unable to give three-year probation orders will not respond by giving custodial sentences instead. In the light of what he has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>858</span>
This new clause would increase the maximum fine available to the courts for identifying a juvenile in reports of court proceedings in a newspaper. Sections 39 and 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 restrict newspaper reports of proceedings in juvenile courts and give the courts the power to make directions that particulars which would lead to the identification of a juvenile should not be published in reports of a case. The current maximum fine for identifying a juvenile in contravention of these sections is £500, and it is my advice that that will be raised to £1,000 under the provisions of clause 30.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I would argue that this maximum seems unlikely to be an adequate deterrent perhaps in a case of some notoriety to a national newspaper which may have made a calculation on a straightforward profit and loss basis, and in those circumstances may consider it highly worthwhile to pay the fine of £1,000, given the increased circulation or publicity and profits which might accrue from the identification of the juvenile in a particularly infamous case. In no way do I suggest or support the suggestion that an innocent error by a newspaper should be severely punished and that the maximum fine should always be imposed. But I believe strongly that there is a powerful case for increasing the maximum fine which can be imposed by a court where a newspaper has deliberately and premeditatedly published the name of a juvenile, given clear indications of the case and caused a great deal of anxiety and distress, not only to the juvenile but also to his family. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will feel able to accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I well understand what lies behind the new clause moved with such commendable brevity by the hon. Gentleman, and all the more persuasively for that. My reply shall take only a little more time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) is under a rare misapprehension when he supposes that the maximum of £500 which has hitherto applied for offences under these two sections will not be increased. Section 39 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 enables courts to prohibit newspaper reports or photographs calculated to lead to the identification of juveniles concerned in any capacity in court proceedings. Section 49 expressly prohibits identifying reports of photographs of juveniles involved in proceedings in the juvenile courts unless the court or the Secretary of State is satisfied that publicity is necessary in order to avoid injustice to a juvenile. Newspapers contravening the court's application of these provisions are at present liable to a maximum fine of £500 on summary conviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not aware of any widespread concern about the present penalty for offences under sections 39 and 49. Indeed, some people would argue that reporting restrictions in the juvenile courts should be liefted and that in certain cases where a juvenile is involved in court proceedings as a defendant—not where he is the innocent party—a measure of publicity could act as a deterrent to young offenders and a salutory shock to their parents. I am not disposed to advise the Committee to alter provisions which seem to have worked reasonably well since 1933, but I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the penalties for their contravention should at least be realistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0613">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>859</span>
To go to £5,000 seems to me to go far too high— £1,000 is the present maximum generally available to magistrates, and it will be seen from clause 29 that that is reflected in the summary fines scale in the Bill. Anything larger than that should be allowed, I believe, only in the most exceptional circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think, of course, topically of the proposal now before Parliament for the licensing of sex shops. Many speeches were made here and in another place pointing to the very large sums of money made by those operating such establishments and the need for a fine to be very substantial if it is to constitute any realistic deterrent there. I do not think that that consideration applies in this instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Newspaper proprietors and editors are generally very careful not to infringe this part of the law, or indeed the law generally. It is not relevant in this instance to ask what defendants can afford to pay but, all things being equal, what is the maximum that the offence merits. A good case could be made out for increasing the maximum penalty available under sections 39 and 49 to £1,000. This has not as yet been done, contrary to the entirely understandable impression of the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am quite prepared to recommend this if the hon. Gentleman would agree to withdraw this new clause, because the present £500 penalty is in line with the penalty in section 4 of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 for publishing or broadcasting material likely to lead to the identification of the complainant— fairly close, in other words, to the matter we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The penalty in section 4 will increase from £500 to £1,000 under the general uprating provisions of clause 30, but because the penalty for offences under sections 39 and 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 was increased from £50 to £500 by the Criminal Law Act 1977, it will remain unaffected by clause 30. There-ore, it will not go up to £1,000. The simplest way to increase it to £1,000 in line with the penalty for offences for offences under section 4 of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 would be to include references to sections 39 and 49 in the list of penalty enactments meriting special increases which is to be found in schedule 3. I am entirely prepared to make that change if that is the wish of the Committee, as I think it probably will be. If the hon. Gentleman is content with that explanation of the matter and the Government's thinking, that might be the most convenient way to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I am not content, otherwise I should not have suggested a £5,000 fine. Neither do I accept all the arguments advanced by the Minister on this occasion. I believe that it is necessary to have a fine here that is related not necessarily to the offence, which the Minister seems to suggest, but to act as some form of a deterrent, and I do not think a £5,000 fine would be a sufficient deterrent, let us say, for example, to the unscripulous activities of the 	<i>Sun</i> or the 	<i>News of the World,</i> and I certainly do not accept that a £2,000 fine would be a deterrent. But given the offer that the Minister has made and the feebleness of my negotiating position, I suppose I can do nothing but accept his offer. If he will amend the Bill on Report to raise the fine

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This new clause would remove the penalty of imprisonment for importuning—in other words, soliciting—by males. It embodies a recommendation of the all-party Penal Affairs Group in its report "Too Many Prisoners" published in 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that report, as hon. Members will remember, we first of all recommended that soliciting by females should not be an imprisonable offence. That proposal is now contained in the Bill and was supported by both the Government and the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also recommended in paragraph 105 that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"there should be similar changes in the law relating to importuning".</p></blockquote>
We drew the attention in the reprt to the fact that male importuners, unlike female prostitutes, are not necessarily out for financial gain. As the Wolfenden report pointed out in paragraph 120:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the most part, those convicted of importuning are in no sense male prostitutes: they are simply homosexuals seeking a partner for subsequent homosexual behaviour".</p></blockquote>
Most of the arguments against the imprisonment of women for soliciting, which the Committee found attractive and persuasive on an earlier occasion, apply with equal force to men soliciting other men with a view to homosexual behaviour. I do not intend to weary the Committee by repeating the arguments that were advanced on that occasion, but since they were accepted then by the overwhelming majority of the Committee, it is extremely important that we should now make similar changes in the law in relation to male soliciting, unless we regard it as justifiable, which I do not, to mete out a harsher punishment for a similar offence to certain offenders solely on the grounds of their different sexual orientation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not regard it as equitable or acceptable that men should be punished more severely than women when both are engaged in soliciting for sexual purposes—in one case, as it appears from the evidence, for money, and in this case, on the evidence of the Wolfenden report, not usually for money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall therefore listen with great interest to the debate today and to those hon. Members who spoke on that occasion and who voted to make female solicitingn on-imprisonable. There were 13 members of the Committee
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0614">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>861</span>
who veted to end the penalty of imprisonment for soliciting by females. I hope and expect the same 13 will be prepared, on the grounds of equity, to make the same kind of stand today and to end imprisonment for importuning by males.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I do not wish to detain the Committee— I am aware that we have more business to get on with after this—by adding to the arguments the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This would be a very sensible change to make. It stands on its own merits. Male soliciting, for the reasons he mentioned, is a sufficiently different matter from female soliciting for the two cases to be quite separable. We could certainly envisage different types of punishment from the one and for the other. The case for doing away with imprisonment for male soliciting stands on its own merits. I should like to see the prison sentence done away with in this case too. I support the hon. Gentleman, and if he presses his new clause to a division. I shall be with him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.19 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended or a Division in the House.</i></p>
	<p>5.32 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of this new clause is to remove the power to order imprisonment in respect of a offence under section 32 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956, which makes it an offence for a man persistently to solicit or importune in a public place for immoral purposes. In contrast to the offences in respect of female prostitution with which we were dealing not very many days ago, this offence is triable either way and it is punishable under schedule 2 on conviction on indictment by a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment or on summary conviction by a maximum sentence of six months imprisonment. The new clause would abolish imprisonment as a penalty for this offence. It would make no change as to the mode of trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that there is a close parallel between this new clause and the one which we dealt with the other day to abolish imprisonment for soliciting by women for the purposes of prostitution. The two offences, I believe, are not similar and have not been regarded as similar by Parliament for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The facts as to the use made by the courts of the power to imprison in the case of male soliciting or importuning for an immoral purpose show that only rare use is made of the power. In 1980, out of 1,136 men and one woman found guilty by a magistrates' court of this offence, nine received an immediate custodial sentence. The vast majority were fined or conditionally discharged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the 52 tried or sentenced in the Crown Court, a further seven were sent to prison. That is a total of 16 men imprisoned out of 1,184 who were found guilty. These figures indicate that, while most offences under section 32 are relatively trivial, warranting only a minor sentence, there is a very small number of cases dealt with under this section which are regarded as so serious by the courts that no alternative is seen to the imposition of a custodial sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>862</span>
It is probably true that this charge is used generally, though not always, against minor acts of public nuisance by homosexuals, in such places as public lavatories. The Committee recently took the view that imprisonment was not an appropriate response in respect of the public nuisance caused by prostitues soliciting. Examination of this offence shows, however, that it goes somewhat wider. It is not merely a "nuisance" provision. When the offence was first enacted in the Vagrancy Act 1898, it was aimed largely at the activities of pimps or "bullies", as they were called, soliciting clients on behalf of female prostitutes. I believe that it is hardly, if ever, used for this purpose nowadays, for a variety of reasons. Pimps are usually dealt with under the offence of living off the earnings of prostitution. The offence was also used for a time against men soliciting women for sexual services—for example, kerb-crawlers—until the ruling by the Divisional Court in the case of Crook v. Edmondson in 1966 that such conduct did not constitute soliciting for "an immoral purpose".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The offence nowadays has come to be used mainly, if not wholly, against men who solicit other men. These can be male prostitutes soliciting for customers, or perhaps male homosexuals seeking someone to participate in a homosexual act. Homosexual acts between consenting adults in private are, of course, now legal. It is not the object of this offence, since the passing of the Sexual Offences Act 1967, to preclude male homosexuals from meeting one another. The offence is specifically aimed at persistent soliciting or importuning in a public place. Some men, who may well be unwilling to receive such solicitation, may find it offensive or even threatening, particularly when the approach is made by the only other occupant of somewhere like a public lavatory. The act which is being solicited may well itself be an illegal one, either because it is intended that it will take place in a public place, or because the person accosted may be under the legal age limit for such acts. Indeed, I understand the provision has been used also against men who solicit or importune under-age girls for immoral purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think it necessarily appropriate here to discuss whether the present age limit for homosexual relations is too high, but it should be recognised that offences under this section can take the form of persistent and aggressive pestering of men who are not homosexuals, or of young men who should enjoy the protection of the law against such approaches. If either of these situations, when the soliciting is of an aggressive character, or aimed at a youth or boy, there will be cases when the court will, rightly, consider an immediate custodial penalty proper, just, and not avoidable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dulwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister say what he means by "aggressive", which he has used twice? I know that there is aggressive salesmanship, and perhaps he is using it in that sense. I do not think that he is using it in the sense of the use of violence, because that would be an offence of its own kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and learned Gentleman is quite right. By "an aggressive approach" I mean an approach pressed with insistence and firmness and, I think, the colloquial use of that word is well understood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In either of those situations, I think that it is right that the power to commit to prison should remain. We would have to be very certain of our ground before we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0615">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>863</span>
removed the power to deal with such offenders in this way. We should not overlook the fact that the courts have always treated this offence as meriting a different maximum from that which relates to soliciting by female prostitutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scope of the offence should be contrasted with the offence of soliciting by a woman prostitute. In that case, the solicitation is normally aimed at adults. It is rare for the prostitute to waste her time persistently accosting a person who has declined her offer, and it is highly unlikely that the person solicited will feel threatened or in any way at risk. Another significant difference between the two offenced is that the male offence is triable on indictment as well as summaraily, when it carries a maximum sentence of two years' imprisonment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would not alter the power to try this offence on indictment. Comparing this with the maximum of three months' imprisonment which has hitherto been available for the soliciting by women prostitutes' offence under section 1, it is clear that to abolish imprisonment altogether for an offence which currently carries a two-year maximum, is a much more drastic change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested, too, that men sent to prison for this offence are taking up prison space which would be better made available for other offenders, but I think it important that we bear in mind the small numerical use which is made of this power, though I do not think that that by itself justifies the removal of the power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From our earlier discussion the Committee will know that the Criminal Law Revision Committee, under the chairmanship of Lord Justice Lawton, is now engaged in a review of the whole law relating to sexual offences, including prostitution, and including the penalties for such offences. In the review the committee has the assistance of the specially-constituted Policy Advisory Committee, with a widely varied membership under the chairmanship of Lord Justice Waller. I understand that the committee's provisional proposals in respect to the offence which is the subject of the new clause, are to be included in the working paper on prostitution which it is hoped will be published in the first half of this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would not be right to pre-empt the consideration which these committees have been giving to the subject, by taking a decision now to abolish imprisonment for this offence, based perhaps on a misapprehension of the use to which the section is put. I suggest that it would be better to await the committee's considered views and deal with the matter in a wider context. I feel fortified in this view by the thought that the evidence shows that magistrates and judges use this section, and this power of imprisonment, very sparingly indeed. I hope that for those reasons—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that my hon. and learned Friend says that we should not pre-empt the committee's findings, but from his earlier remarks I rather supposed that he himself was disposed to accept that imprisonment should continue which, after a fashion, also seems to pre-empt the findings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must make up our mind before a committee appointed for the purpose has published its provisional views in the form of a working paper, as
	<span class='label label-info column'>864</span>
to whether one regards the present operation of the law as reasonably satisfactory, or whether one regards it as so wholly wrong that one is not prepared to have one's mind changed even by a distinguished committee when it duly reports. I do not find myself in that position for reasons that I have tried to explain. Having regard to the small number of people sent to prison under this section, I doubt whether any member of the Committee would find his mind so firmly made up in that way as yet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have this committee appointed to deal with all these matters of sexual offences, and I believe that so slight is the number of cases actually sent to prison that even those who are predisposed to support the new clause ought, perhaps, on reflection, to think it better to await the report of that committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When discussing the possibility of making certain offences non-custodial, the Minister has said on some occasions, as on this one, that so few people are put in prison that we should not get excited about these people blocking up the prisons and causing congestion and overcrowding, whereas when we have talked about a great many people being put in prison— say, drunks who fine default—he has implied that the courts are obviously using this power and need this power and think that this is a valuable power to have. It seems that however many or few are imprisoned, it is difficult to get the Minister to agree that offences should be made non-custodial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Each argument is entirely appropriate in its proper context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we should not come to conclusions on these matters which will involve what is a drastic change in the law, one which would change a view of this offence that has been taken by our predecessors for some 70 years, distinguishing it in the ways that I have tried to explain from the female prostitution offence with which we dealt last week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that it would be wise to do this, having regard to the as yet unfinished work of the committee to which I have referred. It is sensible to have regard to the use which is made of it. There are those who say that such people ought not to go to prison. That is a perfectly tenable view, though I do not hold it myself in the kind of extreme cases that I have described. In that circumstance I should have thought that it was sensible to have regard to the very small numbers of people who actually go there. In other words, if one holds the view of the hon. Gentleman who has moved the new clause, one at least is satisfied that it is very rarely that somebody actually goes to prison at the moment. I hope that I have made clear the way in which the Government approach this proposal, and I hope that the hon. Member will feel able to withdraw the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I admire the Minister's elasticity. In the very last debate we had on the new clause introduced by the hon. Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. Parris) on the length of probation, he defended leaving the position as it is on the basis that there is still a substantial number of cases where the three-year probation period is shortened. We come now to this new clause and he is defending the Home Office position
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0616">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>865</span>
on the grounds that there are so few cases that no harm is being done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully because I have no strong opinions on this matter. I did not put my name down to the new clause and I wanted to hear whether there were any arguments which distinguished it from the case of the prostitute. I was unable to distinguish it at all from what the Minister said. Indeed, we have the odd position that there is no sex discrimination here because apparently a woman can be convicted of this offence of persistently soliciting or importuning in a public place for immoral purposes. I gather from what the Minister said that one has been convicted recently. What precisely the difference is between that offence and the offence from which we have now removed imprisonment I cannot tell, and the Minister did not enlighten us about that so far as women are concerned. I do not know whether this offence is committed if a woman importunes another woman, but I am bound to say that the differences between the two types of offence are so flimsy that one finds it difficult to see any justification other than the purely historical one which the Minister gave us for distinguishing between the two types of offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was said in relation to the prostitute that the essence of the offence, and therefore the wish to retain the ultimate power to imprison, is that she can be a considerable nuisance. When the Minister speaks about aggressive commission of this offence—in other words, persistently being persistent—all he is saying is that people can make an awful nuisance of themselves. Certainly, the philosophy which I should have thought would be the Home Secretary's philosophy and the general philosophy which today emanates from his Department, is that one does not have imprisonment for that which is merely a nuisance, but one retains it for that which is a danger to society. That is the view which I have expressed in many of our debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully understand the problem which has been created by the fact that this offence is triable either way. If the Minister had said that in view of that the new clause in its present form would cause difficulties and he would be prepared to put down an Amendment at a later stage which would give effect to the concept of the new clause, I should have been willing to accept that. But if he is saying that in principle we should retain imprisonment for a small number of cases where it is thought by somebody that the person concerned is too aggressive or, more likely, has committed the offence so often that the court concerned holds up its hands in impatience and asks what it can do but send him to prison, although it knows that it will do no good, that seems to be based on a philosophy which is wholly alien to the rest of the Bill and the way in which the penal system has developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the hon. Minister for Derbyshire, West takes a similar view. I am glad to see his nodding in agreement. I hope for that reason he will support the new clause as, having heard the Minister's reasons for opposing it, I shall do also.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly the Opposition are under no misappre-
	<span class='label label-info column'>866</span>
hension about the effect that removing the penalty of imprisonment for male soliciting would have on the prison population. Nobody put the argument about the effect that it would have on prison overcrowding because, like the Minister, we knew full well that the numbers were so small as to be insignificant. We rest our case on its merits and on the principle of equity and fairness between the sexes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the courts treat this offence seriously and they have always treated it differently. They may have done, but there is no reason why they should be allowed to treat it in that fashion in the future. He also said that the purpose for which men are soliciting may itself be illegal. So it may, but that offence should be dealt with, not the soliciting. To suggest that this should be kept as an imprisonable offence because the purpose for which they are soliciting may itself be illegal is an argument which does no justice to the Minister as a person or a lawyer. I am sure that he does not believe that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I certainly do not accept, nor do I think he would in different circumstances if he were on this side of the Committee, that imprisonment is appropriate as a penalty and certainly not that it should be for the potential period of two years. Like my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin), I cannot believe that the Minister genuinely believes that we are suggesting that men who solicit in an aggresive or persistent manner, thereby causing a nuisance, nor the other rather loose expressions he used on that occasion, should be imprisoned for that kind of behaviour. If that behaviour is aggressive in a violent way, as my right hon. and learned Friend suggested, it should be dealt with under the ordinary law. If their soliciting is so persistent as to be a public nuisance, it should be dealt with by the law on public nuisance or whatever it happens to be. They should not be dealt with nor be caught for that kind of behaviour under the rubric of the law on soliciting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the height of hypocrisy for that to happen in practice, as well as for the Minister to pretend to justify that we would imprison people not for the substantive offence which they commit but for something else which he can describe as immoral and adopt all kinds of double standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that this would be a drastic change. I do not accept that it would be a drastic change. Even if it is a drastic change, perhaps it is the kind of drastic change that we should make as being preferable. He says it has been the law for 70 years. I suppose the imprisonment of females who solicit has been the law for more than 70 years. Certainly those elements of the Vagrancy Act that the Minister has undertaken to change have been the law for 70 years and so also has the Sus law been a law for more than 70 years, yet he and his Government have already changed that. To come before this Committee and say "Do not change it, it is too drastic a step, there are only 16 a year who go to prison and it is minor and insignificant anyway" or " Do not change it, it has been on the statute book for 70 years" is to demean both himself and the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not done justice today either to the arguments that support this particular case, to the merits of the case or indeed to himself. On those grounds I have no alternative but to force this to a Division and to ask hon. Members to support it with their votes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>RESTRICTION OF CUSTODIAL SENTENCES FOR DRUG-DEPENDENT OFFENDERS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"Where a person is convicted of an offence which the court considers would not have occurred but for the offender's addiction to drugs of any decription, the court shall not pass a custodial sentence on the offender unless it is of the opinion that no other method unwilling to respond to non-custodial penalties or because a custodial sentence is necessary for the protection of the public or because a lesser sentence would depreciate the seriousness of the offence."—[	<i>Mr. Kilroy-Silk.</i>]</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It stipulates that offenders whose offences spring from dependence on drugs should not be given a custodial sentence, unless a custodial sentence is essential for the protection of the public, the offence is so serious that a lesser sentence would be inappropriate or it appears to the court that the offender is unable or unwilling to respond to non-custodial penalties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tabled the clause at the request of the Standing Conference on Drug Abuse, and it is designed not to change the law but to draw the Committee's attention to the considerable number of drug misusers imprisoned each year for whom alternative measures, dealing in particular with their problems of drug addiction, would be a much more positive response to their individual needs as well as providing more effective protection for the community against their criminal activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1979, 1,263 inmates were reported by prison medical officers to have some degree of dependence on drugs at the time of their reception into custody. This is probably a substantial under-estimate of the actual number of drug dependents in the prison system. There is also general agreement within the prison system that prison in itself is not an appropriate place for drug abusers, and that it is no proper place for the treatment of drug dependence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the prison system there are very few serious attempts at therapy for drug dependents held in custody. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs identified only five attempts at therapy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>868</span>
First, the therapeutic unit at Holloway prison which caters for up to 20 women, most of whom are drug dependents. There is the annexe at Wormwood Scrubs, only recently saved from closure, which includes two therapeutic groups of about 12 each for former drug dependents, but also includes alcoholics and gamblers. There are all six wings of Grendon psychiatric prison which includes drug addicts. Fourthly, in Pentonville, the prison psychologist runs weekly groups for drug dependents. Finally the fifth unit providing therapy is that at Felthan borstal where the borstal itself offers a range of therapeutic treatment opportunities for those with drug problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its report, "Drug Dependents Within the Prison System in England and Wales" published in 1979, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs recommended that further experimental units on the lines of those adopted at Holloway and Wormwood Scrubs should be established in other prisons with a substantial number of drug dependents. That particular recommendation, not yet implemented and not given very serious consideration, is one that is worthy of support. At the same time we should not overlook the fact that, in the case of prisoners who have been through one of these programmes in one of the five units within the penal system, the therapy is rarely continued on release from prison, and our efforts therefore must be devoted to keeping drug dependents out of the prison system at all costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By no means all drug dependants in prison have been imprisoned for drug offences as such. Many of them will have committed other offences, very often connected with their drug use, for example burglary or theft—not infrequently of a chemist's shop in order to obtain the drugs on which they are dependent—or to obtain the financial wherewithal to buy the drugs. They have also very frequently been accused, convicted and sentenced for the foregoing of prescriptions and many other similar kinds of offence that arise out of their drug dependence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Clark 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Sutton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman allow me to guide him on this matter?

The hon. Gentleman is not suggesting, is he, that these offences should be treated any differently simply because they arise from a state brought about by addiction to drugs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman does himself the courtesy of reading the new clause he will see that it clearly states that those who are a danger to the public should be given custodial sentences—	<i>[Interruption.]</i>— After I have finished my point I will give way to the hon. Gentleman again if he still wishes to intervene. Of course I take the point. It should not need either his intervention or my reiteration to make clear that someone who is convicted of murder, of serious violent crime, of burglary or of the forging of a prescription must be dealt with in the courts for that particular offence. I have never suggested that that should not be done. I am suggesting—and I have intimated clearly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0618">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>869</span>
that this is a probing clause, if one can call it that, designed to highlight the inadequacies of provision folding dependants—is that the drug dependency which gives rise to the crime, of which the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mr. Clark) is quite rightly afraid, should be dealt with. I am sure he accepts that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I was making before I had to—as the Opposition often have to—establish our law and order credentials in the face of the onslaught from the concerned and conscientious Conservative right hon. and learned Gentlemen—was that all too often the imprisonment of drug dependents does nothing to help them to deal with their drug dependence, of which—the point I was making—their criminality or their offences are merely a symptom. The evidence we have from the Home Office suggests that many of those who were dependent upon drugs at the time of their offence and their conviction and sentence and receipt into custody are just a dependent upon those drugs upon release from custody, even though they may have had the benefit of some kind of therapy whilst in prison. Indeed, it unfortunately seems that for many drug abusers the way back to some kind of status or esteem or friendship among their peers is via the drug system. The result is, unfortunately, that a great many of them die very quickly on release from prison, because whilst there they have been kept off drugs, but on release they immediately return to their pre-incarceration level of drug use. The result is that their bodies are unable to tolerate it, and many of them die from overdose. A study of all addict deaths in London between 1970 and 1974 found that 10 per cent, of them died within a few days of release from prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I imagine that there is widespread support, in theory at least, for the general principles embodied in the new clause. The problem in practice is the absence of residential and non-residential facilities which can be used as an alternative to imprisonment for drug dependants. It is estimated that there are about 20,000 opiate and barbiturate addicts in this country, yet we have only 250 places in rehabilitative hostels for drug users. Again, we have only seven non-residential drop-in street agencies working with drug users in five cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, some areas have no services with any expertise in handling drug-related problems. For example, Yorkshire and the North-East have no non-residential facilities managed by voluntary organisations. The only facilities in that area are the three hospital-based drug treatment clinics. Again, the whole of the South-West has no specialised services for drug users, and Wales has only a clinic in Cardiff. Even the areas which have some provision are grossly underprovided in terms of the demands that are made upon the services, and the needs of the drug-users and abusers in those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That position, bad and hazardous as it is, with a very patchy system of both residential and non-residential facilities will, one assumes, become considerably worse, because of the increasing round of Government cuts in public expenditure, with many of the voluntary organisations working with drug-users facing at present severe and in many cases crucial financial difficulties. Many of them, as the Minister will know, have been forced to reduce their services, and some indeed have been compelled to close down because of the cut-backs imposed by the Government on public expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the hostels have been extremely badly hit by their dependence on a system whereby the fee for
	<span class='label label-info column'>870</span>
individual residents in a hostel is paid by the local authority, and where in the past the local authority has perhaps been prepared to pay such a fee has now refused to accept applicants for hostles from their residents because of the cut-backs in funding from the central Government. Therefore many of the voluntary organisations providing important and much-needed services are themselves, by a roundabout method—a back-door method in effect—feeling severely the cut-backs made by the Government in public expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was for that reason that the all-party penal affairs group recommended that we in this country should follow the example of other countries such as Germany, Holland, and the United States, and introduce a permanent system of central Government funding facilities for drug misusers. If we look at other groups of offenders we find that national funding is available. We find it, for example, available for after-care hostels for ex-prisoners provided for by the Home Office. We find that national central Government funding is provided for employment schemes for offenders of the kind run by NACRO and the Manpower Services Commission; and again, for day centres for offenders organised and paid for by the Home Office. Fourthly, we find the central allocation of national funding provided for by the Department of Health and Social Security for mentally-disordered offenders to be provided with regional secure psychiatric units.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In each of those cases—and there are many others— successive Governments have recognised that there is an important client group of people who need particular services, whose funds need to be provided as a matter of priority nationally, because they are unlikely to be provided on the scale and in the geographical locations necessary, by local authorities or area health authorities. It seems to me both illogical and wrong that facilities catering for offenders with drug problems should not have the same kind of protection of central funding as is available for at least the four other areas that I have mentioned, and for many others, and should instead be at the mercy of the varying priorities of local authority social service committees and health authorities; especially as they have to compete in those areas with the policies of electorally more popular client groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The voluntary organisations, which bear a heavy brunt of responsibility for the provision of services in this area, must clearly be adequately supported financially. If we do not support them financially, then the social and health services will become increasingly unable to cope with the scale of the problem. The result of that will be that the penal system again will become the only response, and our only response, to the problem of drug misuse. The penal dustbin referred to not least by the governor of Wormwood Scrubs, and others in reference to our penal system as a whole, will become increasingly a social and penal dustbin into which we pour all those individuals for)whom we are not prepared, and for whom we are not willing, to provide the alternative facilities within the community, with the financial resources to support them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only do we need a wider range of facilties for drug dependents to be provided. We must also develop ways of presenting those facilities much more systematically to the courts as an alternative to sending a drug abuser to prison. In Manchester, for example, there is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0619">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>871</span>
the impressive Lifeline project, an induction programme designed for those who desire to give up the use of drugs. It has, I submit, pointed the way, especially in trying to develop a programme that has coherence and credibility, and that can be presented to the courts as a sensible, constructive and worthwhile alternative that may benefit both the community and the drug abuser.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the two weeks of the Lifeline project's induction programme the drug user must agree, as a condition of the programme, not to use drugs or alcohol. He has to agree to attend the project daily and to live in a supervised hostel. Most of the drug users involved at the project are already on bail, and in the case of those on bail the requirements I have outlined are usually made a condition of bail. Each day of the programme centres round a lengthy counselling session, the rest of the day being spent on work projects. The drug user is given information about different types of drug rehabilitation and as a condition of being on the programme, is required to give a great deal of thought to his requirements for the future. Once a decision is made as to what the drug user himself wishes to do, the programme prepares him for that type of rehabilitation. A report on the individual's progress is then provided to the court, proposals for the future are outlined, and the court, in the light of the experience of the Lifeline project, frequently accepts that proposal as a direct alternative to imprisonment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our report "Too Many Prisoners", brought out by the parliamentary all-party penal affairs group, commends that approach, and hopes that it will become more widely adopted. It cannot become more widely adopted, of course, unless we have more NACROs and more Lifeline projects throughout the country. What is seen on evidence to be working effectively in Manchester, and appears to be a sensible and viable alternative to imprisonment, one which perhaps helps drug users to deal with their problems in the community where properly they should be dealt with, cannot be offered unless similar organisations and programmes are made available. That depends on the willingness of the Government to provide resources either locally or by central Government funding, for which I have argued and which the Parliamentary All-Party Penal Affairs Group has supported.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An alternative, or perhaps an additional proposal, to that operated by Lifeline, has been put forward by SCODA, which suggests that on the first appearance of a drug defendant in court, he should be referred to an assessment unit. Following assessment, a set of treatments should be agreed with the defendant and a report prepared for the court incorporating a recommended so-called treatment package. It is suggested by SCODA that the court should then remand the court hearing for a period of six months, that is, in effect, defer sentence for a period of six months. At the next court hearing, if the defendant has made good progress in the interim period, the court should decide either not to proceed with the prosecution or to take good progress into account when imposing sentence. SCODA has suggested that such a scheme should be introduced experimentally in two or three selected areas and, if it proves to be of value, then perhaps it could be incorporated into legislation and extended in a national and comprehensive fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>872</span>
In view of the present gloomy picture of the lack of treatment facilities for drug misuse, it would be understandable if the Minister found it necessary to resist the new clause on the ground that in most parts of the country the facilities needed to make it a sensible proposition simply do not exist. I accept that. It is one of the difficulties with which we are confronted. My reason for raising the subject and insisting on dealing with it at proper length in spite of the disruption of some of the louts on the Government side is that even though we are at the end of the Committee stage, nevertheless it is an extremely important issue and one which has been neglected not only by the House but by successive Governments of all parties. We do no service to ourselves or to drug abusers if we do not pay proper attention to their needs and problems and ways of overcoming them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My purpose in pushing the new clause is to make the Government answer the case of the inadequacy of facilities for drug users. I am sure that the Minister is no more attracted than I to the imprisonment of people whose offences stem from their inadequacy or their control by a drug. I would rather deal with the causes than attack the symptoms, if he would prefer to ensure that the facilties for dealing with drug misusers are provided. But the fact is that they are not. I should like to see the Minister intimating that he accepts the principles embodied in the new clause, at least as ones that we should work towards. I hope therefore that the new clause will have served the purpose of drawing attention to what can only be described as the scandalous lack of provision for a highly disadvantaged and neglected group of our fellow citizens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) has no need to justify the time that he has devoted to this important matter. He fairly said at the outset that his new clause was of a probing nature. I welcome the opportunity that it has given to examine the position of those who commit offences and who are also drug dependants. The purpose of his new clause is to lay down guidelines for the court in sentencing drug dependent offenders. We ought to remind ourselves of what his new clause would achieve. It seeks to prevent the passing of a custodial sentence on such an offender in a case where the court believes that the offence would not have been committed unless the offender had been drug dependent, unless it is of the opinion that he is unable or unwilling to respond to non-custodial penalties, or because a non-custodial penalty is necessary for protection of the public, or because a lesser sentence would not be appropriate because of the seriousness of the offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can readily sympathise with the spirit of the new clause, in the sense that it follows the sentencing principles which the courts are already likely to follow. But the Government's approach to any attempt, however justifiably intentioned, to restrict the discretion of the courts through statutory guidelines of the kind proposed always has to be one of caution. The area covered by the new clause is one where such an approach is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are, of course, substantial facilities in the prison system for the treatment of those who are addicted to or dependent upon drugs. Prison medical officers are statutorily responsible for the care of the mental and physical health of prisoners. They are registered medical
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0620">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>873</span>
practitioners and have complete clinical freedom. They also have the same ethical standards as their colleagues who work outside prison. The prison medical service has considerable experience in dealing with drug dependence. The treatment given is entirely a matter for the medical officer's clinical discretion. The medical officer may refer a prisoner for a consultation with a Health Service specialist or, if he feels that the facilities in his establishment do not meet a prisoner's needs, he can arrange a transfer to a more suitable establishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report on drug dependence in the prison service by the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, which was produced in 1979, provided a comprehensive and useful survey of the arrangements for recording the number of drug-dependent persons in the prison system, the facilities for treating them and for assisting them on release. Unfortunately, the consultations about the various recommendations have taken longer than we had hoped, but the Government will be giving careful consideration to this matter in the light of those consultations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Drug dependence is difficult to diagnose and is in any case a matter of degree. Most people are to some extent dependent upon one drug or another. I say "most people" because most people use substances such as tea or coffee or tobacco, or there are even our regular moderate drinkers. The problem of defining addiction is, however, a difficult one. The statutory definitions of addiction contained in existing regulations operate only in relation to certain controlled drugs and only for the purpose of the notification to the Home Office of addicts. It is by no means clear that the definition would be appropriate in the circumstances envisaged by the new clause, particularly if it were to cover dependence on drugs to which it does not at present apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have no reason to believe that the courts use their sentencing discretion in this area with anything other than great sense and care. This is not a problem the dimensions of which are easy to measure. One has always to remember the obligation of the courts to protect the ordinary members of the public, and it does not much matter to the ordinary member of the public whether he is hit over the head or burgled by somebody who is a drug dependant or somebody who is not. What he requires if he is to retain confidence in the penal system is that the law will provide a sensible and effective measure of protection against that kind of thing happening to him. Naturally, the courts will take into account evidence about the drug dependence in one degree or another of those who appear before them. But I urge the Committee to hold that this cannot and must not be a deciding factor in determining whether a custodial sentence may be imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are no reliable statistics on the number of drug-dependent offenders who receive custodial sentences, although we know that in 1980 prison medical officers assessed 1,003 people, including those on remand, received into the prison department establishments as being dependent upon drugs other than alcohol.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has referred to the all-party penal affairs group and the research which has been recommended by it. The research proposed by the group for evaluating the impact of sentencing on drug-dependent offenders presents considerable problems. Simple comparison of the outcomes of different forms of sentence would be meaningless unless comparable
	<span class='label label-info column'>874</span>
samples of offenders could be allocated at random. There is, however a need, which has been recognised by the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, to know more about the reasons why drug-dependent persons are sent to prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even this research is not without its difficulties, but the need is being borne in mind in formulating research programmes for future years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The desire to await the evaluation of the response of an offender to treatment or rehabilitation is, of course, a factor that may lead a court to defer a sentence under its powers under the 1973 Act. Courts may link probation or a conditional discharge with a rehabilitation programme. The provision of such treatment and rehabilitation programmes is the responsibility of local health and social service authorities, supported by help from voluntary organisations. In this financial year my Department will have provided over £300,000 to assist with the provision of beds for clients of the probation service in hostels for persons with drug dependence. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, established to advise the Government on all aspects of drug abuse, is currently reviewing the whole range of treatment and rehabilitation facilities for drug abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that it intends to present a report on this later this year, which will, as I have indicated, be carefully considered by the Government. The advisory council was established under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, and the Government attach great importance to its deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be unwise to single out drug dependence for the kind of guidelines that are proposed to the courts, only because it may be a factor—even the sole or principal factor—behind the committing of a principal offence. If the offence itself merits punishment, then the court has to decide what the appropriate punishment is, taking into account all the circumstances of the case and following the general guidance of the Court of Appeal on sentencing principles. The need for treatment or rehabilitation will always be something which the court will wish to take into account, and in my expereience does take into account. It will sometimes be a factor bearing on the sentence; but it will not always, and I suggest that it cannot ever be a decisive matter when the court considers the question of custody or no custody. This is a matter properly left to the courts to decide. Certainly I know that the courts pay careful attention to the availability in the community and outside the prison establishments of the kind of voluntary organisations to which the hon. Member for Ormskirk in moving the clause has referred. Many of them are extremely valuable, and do dedicated and valuable work, to which the Government attach considerable importance. The courts do not close their eyes to the possibility of effective rehabilitation being carried out in the voluntary sector, any more than they ignore the fact that there is substantial capacity for treatment of drug dependence within the prison service, as I indicated at the beginning of my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to leave these matters to the discretion of the courts, and not seek to fetter them with restrictions that would themselves raise considerable problems of definition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dissent from anything that the hon. and learned. Gentleman has said in the last passage of his speech, when he was talking about the discretion that must be left to the courts. I acknowledge that the courts must decide whether to pass a custodial sentence or, as it were, to place the defendant in the hands of something like the Lifeline Project in Manchester.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I have made, to which the Minister has not yet addressed himself, is that the courts cannot make that choice if the community-based facility is not available in their area. They can make a choice, for example, in Manchester, as to whether a particular defendant who is a drug abuser should be given a custodial sentence for an offence, or whether he should go through the Lifeline Project's induction programme. There the court does have a realistic choice before it.

The same kind of choice does not apply to a similar offender convicted, let us say, of exactly the same offence, with precisely identical needs, who happens to be on that day in Birmingham. It is that absence of nation-wide facilities that inhibits the courts' making a proper and realistic decision, and is the motive behind the debate of this subject tonight. What I wish to ask the Minister quite simply is what chances does he think there are of the kind of facilities provided by NACRO and Lifeline project in Manchester becoming more universally aavailable and at the dispensation therefore of the courts, and what is he prepared to do to ensure that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Help, as the hon. Gentleman knows, is avilable, and as he has said not universally throughout the country but in many areas, from voluntary organisations. But I acknowledge that it is not nearly as widespread as we would wish. If the advisory council makes recommendations on changes in the arrangements for funding voluntary or statutory treatment and rehabilitation services, then of course health Ministers will consider those recommendations very carefully. As the hon. Gentleman knows, arrangements for the funding of these services and of these organisations is, under our present arrangements, a matter for local decision and initiative by the health and local authorities and I think there are sound reasons for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The advisory council may recommend a departure from that principle. If it does the Government will certainly consider it, but I think that there are very substantial advantages in keeping local control for reasons which I think are too obvious to need reciting here. We will have to wait and see what the advisory council says. I do not think the contribution made from central funds at present towards the support of these local and voluntary services is negligible. We could all of us wish to see more money available for this as for a great many other deserving recipients. But I hope the hon. Gentleman will feel that in the course of what has had to be a reasonably short speech I have been able to express my understanding of the concerns that lie behind his new clause. Drug dependence is a dangerous and worrying manifestation of the difficulties with which we are coping. Nobody wants imprisonment imposed in circumstances where that is not necessary for the protection of the public. It is important, however, that the public as a whole should know that drug dependants who go to prison
	<span class='label label-info column'>876</span>
are simply not just ignored, but that their particular problems are capable of receiving concerned, skilful and up-to-date treatment. In those circumstances, and bearing in mind the purpose for which he moved this clause in the first instance, I hope it may be possible for him now to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: am slightly disappointed that the Minister perhaps was not a little more positive, particularly on some of the specific proposals, that I put forward, and disappointed too that perhaps more hon. Members did not feel inclined to participate in what could have been an important and crucial debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main thrust both of the clause and of my speech was to try to ensure that there are proper facilities within the community, not just within the penal system, for dealing with drug abusers rather than having to unnecessarily and inappropriately put them into prison. One of the reasons why we do not have those facilities available on a national, comprehensive and coherent pattern throughout the country is precisely because decisions have been left to local initiative. The Minister says it has been left to local initiative for reasons that are all too obvious. I do not know what those obvious reasons are—I did not want to press him to specify them because I know he is conscious of time. I know why it should not be left to local initiative. Hon. and right hon. Gentlemen on both sides of the House will recognise that if there is competition within a local authority or a local area health authority for the social services department resources between providing a rehabilitative hostel for drug abusers and a hostel for the elderly, the elderly will win, the drug abusers will always lose. If there is the same kind of competition within an area health authority for some rehabilitative facility for drug abusers and a heart or a kidney unit or something similar, the drug abusers will again always lose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They always have because there is not—quite properly and quite sensibly—the same amount of political muscle, popular appeal and local pressure behind their needs and their problems as there are behind those who are elderly or have heart problems or want kidney treatment. That is why these kinds of service, if they are to be provided, can be provided only if their priority is determined centrally and the funds are provided nationally and centrally. The Government already admit that principle in many other areas. I have cited four or five, not least the example of central funding provided for the mentally disordered offenders. Another which I did not cite but which we have debated in the Committee on other occasions is the money provided under the Children Act 1975 for secure accommodation for children in every regional planning area—again money given in recognition of the fact that local authorities will probably not provide the money if left to their own devices—and if those facilities were to become a reality the money had to be allocated centrally and in accordance with nationally-determined priorities. I am very sorry that although the Minister is prepared to go along the line of saying the Government will consider such a recommendation very seriously if made by the Advisory Council, he was nevertheless unable to meet that particular point and accept it today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that this new clause was moved in the spirit of trying to encourage and entertain a debate on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0622">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>877</span>
appalling and scandalous absence of adequate facilities for drug abusers. We have not, unfortunately—through reasons which are certainly beyond my control—had that debate, but it is not my intention to press the new clause to a vote.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As you know, Mr. Dean, as hon. Gentlemen opposite well know, I have moved many new clauses and amendments to the Bill. Unlike the Minister I have had here today for my support an impressive array of people who have demonstrated by the carrying of green bags from the House of Commons shop, that they, too, believed that we would finish the Committee proceedings today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have, however, together with many of my right hon. and hon. Friends, had enormous help and assistance from organisations outside the House of Commons. They have briefed us on all our subjects. Not least of those organisations is NACRO. It would be remiss if at least I was not able to place on record my thanks for what NACRO has done in providing me with briefs, information and so on. In particular I want to pay public testimony to Paul Cavadino, who has attended all the meetings of the Committee, and has briefed not only me and my colleagues in the parliamentary all-party penal affairs group, but also the Opposition Front Bench. He has been available to us all in a courteous, helpful and informed manner to give us all the information we required, often at extremely short notice.

This has been an interesting Committee to chair. It has been a good-humoured Committee. The job of the Chair has been by no means over-burdensome.
