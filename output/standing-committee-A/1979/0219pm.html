	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 23, in page 4, line 32, leave out from "and" to end of line and add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The exclusion or expulsion of a worker from membership of a specified union or one of a number of specified trade unions under the conditions of subsection (1) above shall not be deemed to be unreasonable if the worker is of a description different from that or those of the majority of the members of that union or does not possess the appropriate qualifications for such membership".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 22, in page 4, line 32, leave out from "in" to the end of line 35 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"accordance with the requirements of its rules".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was levelling some faint reproach at the Minister for treating the Committee and our arguments with less seriousness than they deserved. I suggested that the cavalier approach that he adopted this morning and the brusque way in which he dismissed our arguments were not the best way of proceeding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Goodhew. Will my right hon. Friend note that some of us at the back cannot hear him? I should be grateful if he could raise his voice just a little.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall readily respond to that request, Mr. Goodhew, though it is not a complaint that is usually levelled at me, particularly in the Committee. I was
	<span class='label label-info column'>480</span>
saying that the Minister's attitude and the brusque way in which he dismissed what I felt were very strong arguments advanced by the Opposition on a serious issue did not help to make progress. I had hoped that we might have the amendment decided upon before we broke for lunch, but as we were unable to do that perhaps I may make a few further remarks on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I moved the amendment in a very brief speech, and I should not have intervened further had not the Minister made what I thought an excessively arid needlessly provocative statement containing what I described as a wild hypothesis about an extremely unlikely ambulance driver. If that is the way in which the hon. and learned Gentleman intends to respond to the important points that we raise, we shall treat him with rather less courtesy than we have extended to him so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman was frank in agreeing that these provisions are discriminatory against trade unions, and are intended to be—discriminatory, that is, against one particular group of institutions within our community, the trade unions. He defended that discrimination by saying that the trade unions were peculiarly powerful in that they had in many cases the power to control a person's right to work—his livelihood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to reopen that discussion other than to remind the Committee that there are many other professional bodies which have a similar power to influence a person's livelihood. For example, there is the Law Society and the professional institutions which have their own codes of conduct. If a person is in breach of such a code of conduct, and is found to be so not by an independent judicial body but often by an internal committee of the organisation, that can similarly affect his right to pursue his career and earn his living.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an even sharper example within the Bill itself. If there is one group of individuals who have more power than any other to deprive people of their livelihood it is the employers. The Bill deliberately sets out to strip from many workers the limited rights which they already have to defend themselves against unfair dismissal. I am talking not about fair dismissal but of the Government deliberately setting out to deprive workers of what little right they have to defend themselves where they have been unfairly dismissed, and then having the gall to tell
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0761">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>481</span>
us that they are providing this discriminatory provision against unions because unions can affect a man's livelihood. That strikes me as a bit much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the view expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo), that what we are proposing in the amendment is wholly reasonable. We are not stripping from the tribunal the power to take account of union rules just as the Minister said the independent review committee has the power to take account of them. I sought to give an example of where it might have to take into account, and comment upon union rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are seeking to remove the specific instruction in the Bill. The hon. and learned Gentleman said at one stage that it was purely declaratory, that it was just a piece of rococo or decoration, but he went on to point out just how serious it would be and that it was the Government's intention that this power should be conferred upon the tribunal. All we seek to do is to remove those words, which are an instruction to the tribunal, and to leave it for the tribunal to use its discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman must give more consideration than he seemed prepared to do this morning to the point I raised about the conflict that may arise if the tribunal exercises the discretion that will be conferred upon it and instructs a union to ignore or act contrary to a provision in its rule book, and thereafter there is a possible—in some circumstances, I think, a probable—challenge in the High Court against that union if it chooses to follow the instruction of the tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough for the hon. and learned Gentleman to dismiss the point merely by saying that he thought that such a case was extremely unlikely to arise. I think that it may well arise, and our proposal deserves further consideration and a rather more responsible answer than we have had so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of what we have heard—it is open to the hon. and learned Gentleman to make a further response to seek to dissuade us—I think that we must divide the Committee, and I urge my hon. Friends to vote for the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Smarting under an unaccustomed attack from the right hon. Gentleman. I feel that
	<span class='label label-info column'>482</span>
I must respond briefly to what he said, because it would be sad if we were to spoil the record of good temper which has so characterised our proceedings thus far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I express my thanks for what was said by the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) in recognising that there are arguments against amendment No. 22, and in reply to the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) I should explain yet again why on the advice that we have received, we cannot accept amendments Nos. 23 and 25.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The declaratory nature of the subsection has this intention. It makes clear that the reasonableness of a union's action is to be decided
	<br><blockquote><p>"in accordance with equity and the substantial merits of the case".</p></blockquote>
Second, it makes clear that, in particular, the reasonableness of a union's action shall not be decided only on whether the action is in accordance or not in accordance with its rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The advice that the Government have received—the right hon. Gentleman knows that there are technical matters as well as matters of policy involved in these considerations—is that the second of these purposes follows from the first, which applies whether explicitly stated or not. The advice is that the second component should be stated explicitly in legislaton in order to remove any doubt that what the clause establishes is a new substantive right for individuals and not just a procedure by a tribunal for enforcing existing common law rights upon the application of trade union rules. The removal of this elucidatory passage, so the Government are advised, would make the law less clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to the hon. and learned Gentleman for his unfailing courtesy. What he says may be all right so long as he can establish that there is a need. He has not established that need because he has not established that things go wrong as they are at present. When he was challenged, he produced a number of hypothetical cases. When he was pressed for real cases he behaved like an actor who has forgotten his lines, and then a voice came out of the prompt corner prompting him with a line—the D.C. Thomson case—which proves exactly the opposite of what he set out to prove. The voice from the prompt corner gave him a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0762">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>483</span>
line from the wrong play. How could he establish that there is a real need? He has not established it up to now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that the hon. Gentleman was listening when I reminded the Committee of the experience under section 5 of the 1974 Act. That had a slightly different formula, but it gave a right to a worker not to be excluded from a union. "Arbitrary and unreasonable" was the criterion there—not so very different. I gave the figures. I am reciting them now from memory. There were 16 or 20 cases, of which some were withdrawn. Eight, I think, were successful, and four of those were closed shop cases. It is perfectly plain, therefore that this is not a fanciful concept. It is a concept based in real industrial life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Doncaster says that we are singling out trades unions and asks "What about employers? They have the ability to affect a man's livelihood" Of course, they have the ability to affect a man's livelihood, but each employer has only the ability to affect the livelihood that he individually affords to somebody working for him. The distinction is plain in that a trade union in a closed shop industry has the ability to affect a member's livelihood—full-stop. I do not want to labour the point by repeating it, but that is the distinction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should explain to right hon. and hon. Members that, due to the number of Committees sitting this afternoon, there is a shortage of Doorkeepers and therefore we have had to have the centre door locked for this afternoon's sitting. I hope that that will not inconvenience right hon. and hon. Members too much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Giles Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 44, in page 5, line 2, leave out "or fact".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>484</span>
	<p>The right hon. Gentleman asks how one decides, and he says—I must say I was saddened by this—that I dismissed brusquely the point that he made about the possibility of a union being sued for not applying its own rules. If it were possible for another member of a union to complain to the High Court seeking to compel the union to act in accordance with its rules in the kind of circumstances about which the right hon. Gentleman is talking, the rule must be wrong to require the union to act unreasonably and therefore the rule ought to be changed. That is what I was seeking—I hope not brusquely—to suggest this morning. That will be a matter for the union.</p>
	<p>Therefore, I end as I began—rather a long time ago, I am afraid—by saying that I entirely understand the anxieties behind these amendments. The hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow has been good enough to acknowledge that the case at least on amendment No. 22 is sound. I understand the arguments. They are based upon misapprehension. If, regrettably, the amendments have to be pressed, I must advise my hon. Friends to resist them.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee Divided:</i> Ayes 8, Noes 10.</p>
	<p>This amendment is on a narrow but important point. As it stands, clause 3(8) says that appeals arising from tribunal proceedings on alleged exclusions and expulsions from trade unions may be made to the employment appeal tribunal. It further says that appeals may be made not just on questions of law, but on questions of fact, and this is what we question.</p>
	<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>The Government have always tried to draw an analogy—the hon. and learned Gentleman did it again today—between
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0763">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>485</span>
rights under clause 3 and those under the existing law on unfair dismissals. The Committee should note that under the existing dismissals legislation there is no appeal from an industrial tribunal on questions of fact but only on questions of law. There is therefore a clear advance—or retrogression, as we think.</p>
	<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman must convince the Committee of his case. Why the difference? If we on our side of the House and others outside in the trade union movement draw the inference that the Government's purpose is to allow the employment appeal tribunal more control over trade union expulsions and trade union refusals to admit than over employers' dismissals, the Government have only themselves to blame because they have not made out the case for that difference.</p>
	<p>There is another point. We cannot help noting that the employment appeal tribunal is chaired by a High Court judge. We on the Opposition side have no special prejudice against High Court judges—at least, I have not. Many of them do their job very well.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of my best friends are judges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. I am also prepared, despite considerable recent evidence to the contrary, to accept that they are highly qualified to judge questions of law. What worries me is that under this subsection we are leaving it to a High Court judge to decide questions of fact in important industrial relations issues. This goes against the whole basis of thinking of successive Governments that industrial relations facts and issues of this kind are best looked at by employers and trade unions with the help and advice of those with legal training, but not in this way by High Court judges. We are in trouble once we start to depart from that view which has been taken by successive Governments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are High Court judges the people to decide on the realities of the labour market? That is what they will have to do. Are High Court judges the best people to decide how trade unions work and whether a union rule book should be set aside? We very much doubt it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am moving this amendment shortly because it is a narrow case, though important. We strongly object to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>486</span>
subsection as it stands and believe that the Government ought to reconsider their attitude to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make one final point and issue a warning to the Minister. The industrial tribunal system with its trade union and management participation has up to now been working fairly well. I think that the basis of the law in the Employment Protection Act could be strengthened. This could give greater powers to industrial tribunals, perhaps give greater trade unions rights, and perhaps greater rights to individuals, but as the system stands it is, I think, working well. The more we tamper with it and change it, as is done in this clause, the more we endanger the structure. I hope that the industrial tribunal system will continue, but I am beginning to fear for its future. That is a warning that the hon. and learned Gentleman ought to take to heart.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Radice) was absolutely correct when he began his short speech by saying that the industrial tribunals are the sole judges of fact in issues of unfair dismissal. There is an appeal on a question of law to the employment appeal tribunal but not an appeal on fact. The numerical scale of their jurisdiction is enormously greater than anything that can reasonably be expected to arise under the clause. In 1979 they heard 35,253 cases of unfair dismissal. It is, surely, common ground that under the clause the number of cases will be vastly fewer than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, the employment appeal tribunal already has a jurisdiction to hear appeals on questions of fact as well as law in two particular fields. Under section 136 of the 1978 Act, the employment appeal tribunal
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall hear appeals on questions of fact or law arising in any proceedings before, or arising from any decision of, the Certification Officer under…
	<ol>
	<li>section 8 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974;</li>
	<li>section 8 of the Employment Protection Act 1975".</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
The first of those sections allows an appeal to the EAT over the certification officer's refusal to enter or delete an organisation's name from the list of trade unions or employers' associations; the latter provides an appeal to a union over the certification officer's refusal or withdrawal of a certificate of independence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting in the latter case to note how important that matter is. It is impor-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0764">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>487</span>
tant to trade unions to have a certificate of independence, and it was felt right by the last Labour Government to confer upon the EAT a jurisdiction to hear appeals on fact there, though it is right that the EAT can only hear appeals on points of law from decisions of a certification officer from aggrieved individual members, arising under the 1913 Act, and the Trade Union Amalgamations Act 1964. This is not, then, a new departure, and I wish to explain why we think it right to add to those two precedents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For reasons that I have already tried to explain, it is hard to imagine a more important misfortune that can befall a worker and union member than to have his card withdrawn when he is working in a closed shop industry. We think therefore that it would be hard, if it be practicable to avoid it, to confine his ability to claim compensation—first, a declaration, and then compensation—to an industrial tribunal. In other words, if he does not win first time off, that is it, with no appeal on questions of fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Often, it is necessary for there to be an appeal on questions of fact. At least, it is regarded as desirable and necessary in our criminal law and system of justice. We have always had it. If one is prosecuted in the magistrates' court and convicted, one can appeal now to the Crown court on questions of fact and have a rehearing. That continues what was always the law in the days of quarter sessions. I do not know how many cases are heard in magistrates' courts every year, but they probably run not far short of a million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has always been our law that on important matters, and also on less important matters in criminal jurisdiction, one may appeal. If one does not like the findings of fact that have been made by the court that hears one's case at first instance, one may appeal to the Crown court—or to quarter sessions as it used to be until about 10 years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why that right cannot practicably be conferred in the case of unfair dismissal is to be found in the sheer number of the cases heard every year—35,000. It would be impracticable to give the employment appeal tribunal an appellate jurisdiction on questions of fact there. One would have to enlarge its size enormously, and that is simply not on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of this jurisdiction, however, where we hope and have every reason to
	<span class='label label-info column'>488</span>
believe that the numbers will be very small, it is possible to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government felt that they had to ask themselves this question. Here a new right being conferred in order to give a remedy for a wrong which is of the greatest importance to the person who suffers it. Is there any sound reason why we should not build upon the precedent of the employment appeal tribunal having a jurisdiction on appeals on questions of fact? Is there any reason why we should say to such a chap, "Sorry, you have to put up with what the industrial tribunal says, like it or not"? We came to the conclusion that there was no good reason and we could not justify it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the question of the staffing of the tribunals. I might have hoped for a slightly more positive commendation of the distinguished judge who presides over the employment appeal tribunal than the hon. Gentleman's assurance that he has no special prejudice against High Court judges, but I suppose in these days that that is something. It is worth bearing in mind—indeed, it is important that we should bear in mind—that the president of the employment appeal tribunal normally holds his appointment for a period of years and that, as the hon. Gentleman was kind enough to acknowledge when I made the point three or four sittings ago, the employment appeal tribunal is held in high esteem in trade union circles as well as in other circles. He is kind enough to acknowledge that again now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The president and his other High Court colleagues who preside over different divisions of the employment appeal tribunal are all well versed in industrial matters. It is wrong to say, as the hon. Gentleman did, that we should be leaving it to a High Court judge to decide an important industrial relations issue. That, as I know he will acknowledge, is not an accurate way of putting it, because the employment appeal tribunal is a tripartite tribunal. The High Court judge is the chairman or president, but he is assisted by side members drawn from the TUC and CBI nominees. They have had industrial tribunal experience in most, if not all, cases themselves, and are highly experienced in matters of industrial law and, much more important, practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we feel that this is a legitimate extension of the precedents to which I have referred, not only conferring an important ability upon a claimant to have the

	<span class='label label-info column'>489</span>
decision on facts arrived at by an industrial tribunal tested by a higher tribunal but also conferring upon that tribunal a jurisdiction that we can be confident will be impartially and sensibly exercised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, now that I have had an opportunity to explain why the Government are making this proposal, I hope that there will be seen to be a lot of good sense in it and that the amendment will not be pressed further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Basically, the hon. and learned Gentleman's argument is, first, on the question of precedent. The precedent that he has used is, as he will admit, not exactly on all fours. We are talking here about employees' rights and the real precedent is with unfair dismissals. As he has admitted, the two cases are not being treated alike. His argument is that there is so much work to do over unfair dismissals that it would heavily burden the appeal tribunal if it had to deal with questions of fact. Perhaps that is true, but he should accept that unfair dismissals are equally important and far more frequent than exclusions and expulsions from trade unions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: More frequent, but not more important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Affecting far more people and in that sense more important than exclusions and expulsions. The Government's principle here is wrong in giving a different value to these two important rights. They give a higher value to the issue of expulsions and admissions than they do to the issue of unfair dismissals. I think that the hon. and learned Gentleman has created a very unfortunate impression this afternoon by not accepting our amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the second point, the question of the High Court judge, I pay tribute to the merits of the present judge and to the employment appeal tribunal. We do not, of course, know that each individual High Court judge who may in the future chair the employment appeal tribunal will be as good as the present one. One cannot work on the merits of one particular individual when enunciating a broad overall policy. That is why we doubt that one should give this particular jurisdiction to the High Court judge on what the hon. and learned
	<span class='label label-info column'>490</span>
Gentleman agrees is a very important issue—the question of expulsion and admissions, involving a view of the labour market, a view on trade union rules and on how trade unions work and a view on industrial relations as a whole. It is wrong to give the appeal tribunal this power over facts which is not given on the question of unfair dismissals. I do not accept what the Minister has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of our amendment is, first, to protest again at what we see as a further gross, unwarranted, unnecessary and provocative interference with union rules. These rules have usually been built up over a long period and have been made to withstand the test of the democratic procedure throughout the whole of their development. We see no need for this kind of interference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe furthermore—I hope that our debates have reflected this belief—in the importance of encouraging support for, acceptance of, and adherence to union rules. My own union regards the rule book if not as sacrosanct at least as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0766">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>491</span>
crucially important in regulating the conduct of its affairs. I believe in that, as do most other trade unionists. We believe that our rules have to be developed and applied in a careful way at each stage, reflecting the interests of the members both collectively and individually. But the way in which the Government are proceeding ignores that. They seem to be unaware of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, subsection (9)(	<i>a</i>) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if an application for membership of a trade union has been neither granted nor rejected before the end of the period within which it might reasonably have been expected to be granted, if it was to be granted, the application shall be treated as having been refused on the last day of that period".</p></blockquote>
Do the Government know the way in which trade unions look at applications for membership, especially those unions which have craft traditions and hence craft qualifications and other qualifications, as professional bodies do? Unions are entitled to be as careful in examining the bona fides of those seeking membership as is any other organisation, professional body or political organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do the Government realise that this provision in Bill may be used by those seeking to bounce their way into trade union membership when the union itself is proceeding with due caution checking the individual's credentials? Under this proposal, the individual may be able to go to a tribunal and say "I have been waiting a month for that lot, and I still have not had confirmation that my application has been accepted. I think that that is unreasonable". The hon. and learned Gentleman, I am sure, will tell us that it is for the tribunal to decide what is a reasonable period. What may be a reasonable period in one case may not be in another. But the door is being opened. This is an open invitation for any individual who wants to try to bounce his way into union membership to exploit this provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to subsection (9)(	<i>b</i>). Our amendment No. 40 might be necessary, I thought, to safeguard something that the Government have overlooked, but I was astonished to read in the background paper that far from being overlooked, the example there chosen says that it is specifically directed at the lapse of union membership because of non-payment of subscriptions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is given only as an example of what is within the scope of paragraph (	<i>b</i>).
	<span class='label label-info column'>492</span>
I am sure many of us wondered what was meant when we read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if under the rules of a trade union any person ceases to be a member of the union on the happening of an event specified in the rules, he shall be treated as having been expelled from the union".</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the hon. and learned Gentleman will tell us what other event he had in mind that might be specified in the rules to justify treating cessation of membership as expulsion from the union. For a moment, I shall stick with the one point covered by amendment No. 40—the question whether those who fall behind with their subscriptions and exceed the limit laid down in the rules and are automatically lapsed will be regarded under this new provision as having been expelled from the union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister understand the reality of trade union life? For example, in the construction industry men are often mobile, moving from site to site, often considerable distances, and the particular membership agreement will vary from site to site in terms of the union or unions holding the membership agreement. I understand that these matters are usually handled in a friendly and understanding way in the construction industry, where a person moving from site to site may be required to change his union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present that gives rise to little difficulty or complaint of unjust treatment, if any. I do not know of any. But, in future, when a person moves from a site where he has been a member of one union and is required to take up membership of another union on the second site, his membership of the first will automatically lapse. He will cease to pay subscriptions and forget about his membership of the earlier union, which in the fullness of time will automatically lapse. None the less, under this provision he will be regarded as having been expelled from the union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the hon. and learned Gentleman realise that the trade union movement, by and large, is administered not by full-time professionals but by a small army of often untutored voluntary workers? In future, the voluntary branch secretary, unskilled in law—experienced though he may be in the realities of the trade union world and industrial relations—having been advised by his union's head office of the new provision in the Employment Act 1980, will be required, before he regards a member as lapsed and puts a line through
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0767">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>493</span>
his name in the book, to decide whether it is reasonable for him to do so. How will he be able to judge whether his action in those circumstances is reasonable? That is what the new provision will require him to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will not mrely throw an extra burden on the branch secretary or whoever is responsible within the branch or union. It will inhibit him and others from taking on the job. It will make life intolerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to listening to the hon. and learned Gentleman's explanation of what he has in mind and how these difficulties might not arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has explained in such detail and with such force the practical difficulties which may arise from the operation of subsection (9) that I need to add very little. I wish, however, to make a remark about each of the paragraphs of this subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The words
	<br><blockquote><p>"the period within which it might reasonably have been expected to be granted"</p></blockquote>
in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) can cause difficulty in themselves. It might be difficult to assess what is reasonable. As my right hon. Friend has pointed out, the application for membership is considered not by professional officials—certainly not in the first instance—but by lay officials, honorary officials of a branch. They work in their spare time and they have no secretarial assistance. They may need to communicate several times with the applicant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, as the hon. and learned Gentleman knows, an application for membership of a union has to be cleared with any other union of which the applicant was formerly a member. There may be relationships and agreements between the applicant's former union and the one to which he is applying. Those agreements may have to be examined to see that the application does not fall foul of an agreement or some clause in an agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That creates difficulties in cases—they do occur, as the hon. and learned Gentleman knows—in which a chap leaves a union in the middle of an industrial dispute, perhaps because he does not agree with the dispute or has blacklegged on his colleagues. Being in bad odour with that union, he seeks to get out of the difficulty by applying for membership of another union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>494</span>
All that can take quite a time. I do not know how on earth anyone can define what is a reasonable time in which the application might be expected to be granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I read paragraph (	<i>b</i>), I looked through the rule book of my own union to see what
	<br><blockquote><p>"event specified in the rules"</p></blockquote>
could lead to this action. I could find only two. The first is that a member chooses to resign his membership of the union. In my union a member cannot resign like that, though he may be able to in others. One cannot give members that freedom. One would have the problem of members who blackleg and resign in order to blackleg.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is an appeals procedure, and if a member is refused his application to resign by the national executive council of my union, he has recourse to the appeal tribunal of the union, which consists of lay members whose verdict is binding on the national executive council as well as on the applicant. It is an elected tribunal of lay members. They may grant his appeal. So, either because his original application to resign has been allowed or because it has been refused and the refusal has been overridden by the appeal tribunal, he resigns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the hon. and learned Gentleman want to create a situation in which a member who resigns is deemed to have been expelled? That will not do him any good. It might make considerable difficulties for him in his future career in the industry and in his chances of getting and holding a job. That is the first of the only two happenings that I can find.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other is that referred to by my right hon. Friend—if a member stops paying his subscriptions. A member sometimes, instead of resigning when he wants to, thinks "It costs 12p to send a letter of resignation these days. I will just stop paying the subscription." The hon. and learned Gentleman will say that if a member is expelled for non-payment of subscription, anyone hearing that in a quasi-judical capacity would say that it was a reasonable ground for excluding or expelling him. But he cannot be sure about that. I cannot be sure about that. Nobody can be sure about it. Amendment No. 40 specifically provides for the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0768">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>495</span>
circumstance in which a member is expelled for non-payment of his subs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only trade unions but the Carlton Club, the Athenaeum, the Bethnal Green Rotary Club or the Poplar, Blackwall and District Rowing Club would expel those who did not pay their subs. Nobody seeks to bring in a law to prevent those expulsions. Why should it apply only to trade unions? Why do the Government seek to load upon trade unions obligations which they would not attempt to load upon others? Is the hon. and learned Gentleman trying to protect the man who gets out of a union—or any organisation for that matter—by the device of not paying the subscription, seeking thereby to avoid the responsibilities which go with membership of the organisation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A member may disagree with his branch or his workplace group over some action that it is taking. He may disagree with their decision to enter into an industrial dispute. He may disagree with their decision not to enter into an industrial dispute. He may want to take dispute action when they do not. But he is in disagreement and he expresses his disagreement by stopping the payment of his subscriptions. Does the hon. and learned Gentleman want to make a hero out of this chap? That is what the second half of this subsection does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman has not thought this thing through. I am not sure whether the prompting he is taking from the prompt corner on this question is a line from the right play, either. There is a very strong case, even if he is not prepared off the top of his head to accept these two amendments, for him to say that they justify further consideration by the Government—especially amendment No. 40—that he will give them that consideration and return to the matter at a later stage in our procedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support these two amendments. I start from the premise that it is questionable whether Parliament should seek to interfere in union rules or allow tribunals to override them. I say that, in particular, because we have already agreed that we should have taxpayers' money to have ballots on changes of rule. It seems to me most absurd to have a ballot of members, paid for out of taxpayers' money democratically to establish a rule and then allow a tribunal to override it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>496</span>
The word refers to membership being granted or rejected
	<br><blockquote><p>"before the end of the period".</p></blockquote>
What is a reasonable period? I take the example of my own experience. I left school and started work in the printing industry at the tender age of 14, and have earned my living in it ever since. My main ambition at 14 was to get a card in my union. It was a prized possession, and I applied for membership. I was told that one could not get a card just like that. One had to prove oneself a good member. Certain skills had to be acquired. I was obliged to go to the London School of Printing. It was not until three years later, at the age of 17, that I was admitted to the union. Would the right hon. and learned Gentleman accept three years as a reasonable period? That is the length of time it took me to join my union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Madel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made an important point. He is com-paring admission to a union from the point of view of an apprentice and admission later on, and he has rightly drawn attention to the time it takes to complete an apprenticeship. He started at 14 and completed the apprenticeship at 17. If the clause was altered to draw the distinction more clearly relating to someone who has passed the age of apprenticeship, would that be acceptable to the Opposition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be valuable, yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should certainly appreciate it if that could be done. But I should point out that in my case the three years were not apprenticeship; it was not an indentured apprenticeship. There were other considerations. However, I take the point. That would be an improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (	<i>b</i>) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"an event specified in the rules"</p></blockquote>
and says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"he shall be treated as having been expelled from the union".</p></blockquote>
What does that mean? In our union we have it laid down specifically that if a member does not pay his contributions after X number of weeks his membership is deemed to have lapsed. He has left the union of his own free will. He has not been expelled. If he has left the union in that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0769">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>497</span>
way, shall he be treated as having been expelled? On those two points I should welcome an explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a valuable short debate. I shall begin by giving the reasons why the Government were minded to resist the amendments. The effect of amendment No. 35 would be to leave the clause a good deal less clear in its effect, because tribunals might still find that a failure to come to a decision on an application was exclusion or that lapsing was effectively expulsion. Since unions make very different provisions, the effect might be to make the clause more arbitrary in operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that one has to take account of a possible situation, given all the time that we believe it to be right to give this new remedy for unreasonable exclusion. It may be that, faced with an application, a union would take so long that there was no prospect of the application being determined in one way or another, thereby by procrastination denying admission just as effectively as if it had been denied expressly. It was with that possibility in mind that the subsection was drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) had in mind somebody trying to bounce his way in and after say, a month, complaining that he had been excluded and that it was unreasonable. Industrial tribunals are well enough versed in the realities of industrial life and of trade union practice to know whether a month in those circumstances is reasonable, and, I dare say, pretty reliably to smell out somebody trying to bounce his way in. Therefore, I should not have thought, with respect, that that was a real fear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that stronger points have been made in relation to paragraph (	<i>b</i>) than have been made in relation to paragraph (	<i>a</i>). There is not much ground for fear under paragraph (	<i>a</i>). Under paragraph (	<i>b</i>), it is provided in the clause as drafted that
	<br><blockquote><p>"if under the rules of a trade union any person ceases to be a member of the union on the happening of an event specified in the rules, he shall be treated as having been expelled".</p></blockquote>
The Government had in mind there the fact that union rules differ in the way in which they deal with the lapsing of subscriptions. In some cases they provide for automatic cessation and in others they say that the member is expelled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>498</span>
It would be possible, so it seemed to us, in the case of a cessation of subscriptions occurring—a chap not paying any more—to say "Very well, the rule book provides that you shall be expelled. Therefore, rather than go through the procedure of expressly expelling you, we shall simply not take your subscriptions any more."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am impressed by the arguments that have been put forward, and I think that there are difficulties which perhaps need further examination in regard to amendment No. 35. It is not only in the case of a lapsing of subscriptions that we thought that paragraph (9)(	<i>b</i>) would have relevance—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Needham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The case of SLADE art union comes up here. There is at the moment an example, which perhaps my hon. and learned Friend does not know about, where exactly this happened. Membership has lapsed through nonpayment of subscriptions, and as a result of that non-payment, although the arrears were built up and the individuals concerned then tried to make up their arrears—in fact, they had been advised by the secretary of the union not to pay the arrears—the arrears were refused by the union and they found themselves blacked for not being members of the union. There is, therefore, a practical case now happening, and my hon. and learned Gentleman may wish to be aware of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting illustration. In answer to the right hon. Gentleman, may I say that there are events other than the failure to continue to pay one's subscriptions which might give rise to this result. For example, non-payment might occur for reasons such as an error by the employer in deducting subscriptions from source. The check-off is now widely used, as the Committee knows. There is matter here to be thought of afresh, and I propose to the Committee that if it is thought convenient, on the undertaking that we shall consider this again, having explained what was in our minds in the initial drafting, it may be possible for the amendment to be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say, first, to the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) that the SLADE art union case is the one on which probably all members of the Committee have received a letter.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0770">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>499</span>
It is perhaps unfair to individuals or organisations outside, who have no voice in the Committee to find themselves the subject of criticism or censure here, and to have one side of the case paraded. When I received the letter, I telephoned the writer and I understand that, so far at least, no blacking has taken place and that the lapse of subscriptions involved is over the period of a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the Government would consider a year a reasonable or an unreasonable period in which not to pay subscriptions and yet still expect to have continuing membership. I say that not to make the SLADE case at all but to make the point that we ought to be careful and look at both sides of the issue when we are talking of bodies or individuals who may not be able to defend themselves in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for his reply. I am not sure that I accept what he said in the first part, but I do not want to seem churlish. He has been generous in response to our amendments in saying that he is prepared to look again at the arguments relating to the second point and perhaps come forward on Report with something that will reflect the strength of our argument and the comment that he has himself made. If that is the case, Mr. Goodhew, I should be prepared to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say, Mr. Goodhew, so that there be no misunderstanding, that I cannot give any commitment but I give a sincere undertaking to consider the arguments and review the drafting of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept that. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 36, in page 5, line 27, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(12) No person may make a complaint against a trade union under this section who has not exhausted any appropriate internal appeals procedure of that union relating to exclusion or expulsion from union membership, and who has not exhausted the procedure of the Independent Review Committee established by the Trades Union Congress".</p></blockquote>
This is a straightforward and simple amendment, and its purpose is self-
	<span class='label label-info column'>500</span>
evident. I hope that we shall hear the Under-Secretary tell us that the Government are able to accept at least the spirit, if not the letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do we want to encourage people, for what could be perverse reasons, to invoke the machinery of the industrial tribunal, and ultimately the employment appeal tribunal, on a matter which may well be capable of solution within the trade union concerned, or at least within the TUC machinery? All of us on the Committee would say that we do not wish to encourage that sort of thing. This is what the amendment is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary has said that he feels that self-regulation is, in the main, preferable to statutory regulation. That is precisely what we are proposing here. Every trade union, as far as I know, has its own appeals machinery. I do not know of one that has no such machinery for dealing with the problem of a member who feels himself aggrieved by a decision of the executive. They vary in form according to the way they have solved and developed on the basis of the needs and experience of the individual trade union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The vast majority of problems arising out of exclusion or expulsion are now dealt with on that basis, inside the trade union concerned. If this fails to provide a solution, there is the TUC independent review committee, which was referred to earlier. It is worth while to look in some detail at the work of that committee since it was established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The independent review Committee was set up, as many hon. Members know, in 1976. It was a result of the repeal of section 5 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act, the repeal of which took away a statutory remedy which previously existed. The committee was brought into life to fill that gap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures which I shall give are not carried in my head; I got them from the TUC on the telephone a few days ago. They are not totally up to date but are the most recent available, up to the 1979 Congress report. From 1976 up to that time, a total of 45 cases had been referred to the committee, a fairly small number for three years. Seventeen of those were outside the terms of reference of the committee. For example, they were the type of case which has just been under discussion where a member has excluded himself from membership of the union by failing to pay subscriptions. A member
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0771">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>501</span>
may exclude himself in other ways. In some trade unions, for example, acceptance of voluntary redundancy automatically excludes the member, or he deprives himself of membership. I suspect that that applies in the union to which my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton), belongs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are various ways in which people can rob themselves of membership, and they are outside the terms of reference of the review committee, but even there the machinery—the staff of the committee—has intervened on a number of occasions and has brought about a reconciliation without any formal reference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the remaining 28 cases, 12 complainants either did not proceed with the complaint, or reached a settlement, again with the informal help of the committee staff. Sixteen cases were dealt with formally. In 10 of those the committee recommended to the union concerned that it admit the complainant, or re-admit as the case may be. In three cases it recommended that the union give sympathetic consideration. In three cases there was no recommendation at all. The important point is that in every case where a recommendation was made by the review committee it was accepted and acted upon by the trade union concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can reach one fairly clear conclusion from all this. The number of cases which cannot be dealt with by the internal machinery of the union is very small, but where a settlement cannot be reached there the IRC has proved extremely valuable. It is, of course, much more concerned with finding a practical solution than with pursuing a legalistic course. What it cannot do, unfortunately, is get anyone his job back. Having got union membership back, it cannot ensure that the person goes back into the job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or give compensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman refers to compensation. At this point I draw attention briefly to an interesting article which appeared in 	<i>Industrial Relations Review and Report</i> in September, as a result of a fairly deep study of the work of the independent review committee. The figures given are rather less up to date than those which I have given the Committee, but it is an extremely interesting article and I am sure
	<span class='label label-info column'>502</span>
that the conclusions arrived at are of value to us. In the main, the conclusion is this:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We conclude that the IRC:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>has been highly effective in securing the admission of complainants into union membership in those cases where it has urged such a step".</p></blockquote>
The second half of the same passage says that it
	<br><blockquote><p>"has been completely ineffective in getting complainants' jobs back—when the IRC has recommended re-employment, and the union has taken steps to this end, the employer has refused".</p></blockquote>
If the employer has refused, there is no way in which any part of the trade union organisation, including the TUC independent review committee, can exercise the power that is available to a statutory body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful to quote another paragraph at the end of the article, on the question of re-employment:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The IRC's lack of success here is understandable, as it has no authority (moral or otherwise) over employers and engagement, unlike admission into membership, is not a matter within a trade union's unilateral control."</p></blockquote>
The authors suggest a little later that if the IRC's terms were altered so that it could
	<br><blockquote><p>"consider exclusions or expulsions from trade unions before individuals were dismissed or given notice of dismissal, then the committee would not need to come up with solutions aimed at reemployment".</p></blockquote>
That is a matter which I strongly urge the Government to consider seriously in consultation with the TUC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this amendment we say that the existing machinery ought at least to be tried before people get as far as invoking the law. There will be cases where a complete solution cannot be arrived at. No one would be in any way barred by the amendment from going to the tribunal if the voluntary machinery did not find a solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It cannot be in the public interest or in the interests of good industrial relations to invite people whose motives may be rather less than pure to go straight into an industrial tribunal and ultimately to the appeal tribunal—people who may be exhibition seekers, sensationalists or perhaps just people who want to make a name for themselves or in some way get into the popular press as victims of a trade union.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0772">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>503</span>
It is far better not to encourage people to avoid using machinery which is there on a voluntary basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In accordance with what the Under-Secretary has already told us about his preference for self-regulation as against statutory regulation, I hope he can tell us that the Government will accept the spirit of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take a sentence or two to underline my hon. Friend's last observations. The hon. and learned Gentleman said to us this morning, as he has said to us before in the Committee, something with which both sides agree—that settling these things by voluntary means is much the best way to settle them. But, he said—one cannot dissent from it—sometimes it is necessary to provide a backstop where voluntary means fail. This is exactly what this amendment does. It says that one should exhaust the voluntary means before one uses the backstop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The appeals machinery in some unions is not as good as it is in others. We ought to encourage more and better appeals machinery in trade unions, and it is not a good way to encourage it if one encourages people to bypass it. In the membership of trade unions, as in the community of the whole, there are some who are highly litigious. I never take kindly to litigious people. I do not expect the hon. and learned Gentleman to agree with me because when he is back in opposition after the next election, he will be earning his living as a lawyer from highly litigious people and doing very well out of them. Nevertheless, we should not invite what we call in the East End the sea lawyers to encourage people to bypass voluntary machinery without trying it when they have a chance to try it and go to the statutory provision if they are not satisfied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. and learned Gentleman does not accept this, he is flying in the face of all the tributes he has paid to the voluntary machinery and to the desirability of using it to the maximum possible extent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse what my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) has just said about the importance of voluntary machinery. I endorse also what my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) said in moving the amendment, that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>504</span>
IRC has proved itself to be a very effective body over the years in which it has been working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fear is that, unless the amendment is accepted, the clause will undermine the voluntary procedures and what the independent review committee has actually done. If the Government are serious in what they say about the importance of the IRC, they ought to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like the help of the Committee. Nothing that I say is designed to pour cold water on voluntary procedures for dealing with this type of dispute. I again pay tribute to the work of the independent review committee within the necessary contraints of its terms of reference and what it is able to do. But there are two features that are troublesome, given that we wish to provide an enforceable right not to be expelled unreasonably from a union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is that the IRC does not have jurisdiction, if it finds the case proved, either to order and compel readmission into a union or to order compensation from a union that refuses to act upon its findings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second is that the IRC's procedures necessarily take a good deal of time. There has been some criticism, probably not well founded, of the length of time its procedures take. The importance of this can be easily seen. If one is to have a procedure whereby a trial—I am speaking here of the industrial tribunal or the employment appeal tribunal—can award a declaration and then compensation, it is in everyone's interests that the complaint be taken up quickly and the issue heard while the evidence is fresh. If one has to wait until the procedures of the varous unions have been gone through, it may be a long time before that is reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under subsection (6), we provide that the complaint must be made to the tribunal within three months. That is realistic and in everyone's interest. If one has first to exhaust the voluntary procedures, a much longer time is likely to elapse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, some unions' internal rules provide that the individual is not refused membership or expelled from membership until the appropriate procedures have been exhausted. Some unions say "We shall hold that in abeyance. We shall not throw you out until you have gone through the procedures." Other rules, however, say that the appropriate procedure pro-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0773">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>505</span>
vides that a decision on an explusion is valid at the time that it is given, and it is merely ratified or overturned at the later stages of the procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the latter case, someone might be expelled from his union and it might be months or even a year or more before the final appeal procedure was completed. In that time he is without his union card and may well be without his job. It therefore seemed to the Government desirable to enable someone to make his complaint straightaway and not to have to wait until his job was lost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The tribunals do not meet, as it were, overnight. I have not consulted my right hon. and hon. Friends, but I wonder whether the Minister would be helped out of his difficulty—if he feels that he wants to be helped—by a suggestion that a time limit might be built into this in respect of the trade union procedure. I do not say that that is the most satisfactory way, but it is one logical way of dealing with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to compensation or reinstatement not being available as a consequence of a situation in which an independent review body's decision is defied, there would still be recourse to the tribunal to deal with those points. I should have thought that on both those scores there could be a meeting of minds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difficulty is that, if a time limit is imposed, that is a matter for the rules of the individual trade union. But the terms of reference of the independent review committee state that, before considering an appeal, it must be satisfied that the individual has exhausted all internal union procedures. They may take several months, as we know. Then one has to go through the IRC procedures. The IRC has been criticised for the length of time that it takes to arrange hearings. I do not subscribe to those criticisms, because some delay is inevitable, and one must take account of the fact that its procedure involves conciliation before resort to a formal hearing. One can see how time stretches out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But let us suppose that it all comes right and the complaint is established. The independent review committee says "Yes, you have been unreasonably expelled." Unfortunately, that declaration is not acted upon. One must then go to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>506</span>
employment appeal tribunal, which has to decide the question of compensation. Indeed, one must first go to the industrial tribunal for the declaration, and that will be afforded only on evidence. It cannot take the finding of the IRC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are real difficulties. It is not lack of desire to help, and certainly not any desire to denigrate the value of voluntary procedures, that leads me to the view that we cannot accept the amendment. If we can be helped on this, I shall listen to further argument with an open mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Under-Secretary will look at this again. To persist in the present wording would undermine the voluntary procedures within unions. It would be an open invitation to ignore the procedures and to go straight to the tribunal—if there were many cases, they would clog up the tribunals—rather than deal with them through voluntary procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How many cases will there be? We asked the hon. and learned Gentleman if he could give specific cases of people being expelled. There were not very many. He put forward a hypothetical case of the unlikely ambulance men. I shall not embarrass him by referring to that again. It was the most unconvincing that I have ever heard. Prompted, he remembered Mr. Thompson and the dyers and bleachers. As I understand it, that was dealt with satisfactorily through the IRC. So the only case that he can tell us of—the only atrocity story that we need worry about—was dealt with satisfactorily through the IRC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The case of Mr. Thompson was dealt with satisfactorily by the independent review committee because it was found that the rules of the union had been broken by the union. The result might have been different if it had gone to the tribunal. The tribunal would have been specifically barred from acting in the way that the IRC did, which was to order reinstatement because the union had broken its rules. The tribunal, faced with those circumstances, would not have been allowed to do that. It would not have been allowed to consider that the union had acted unreasonably only because it had acted in contravention of its rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, that is a misapprehension. The subsection provides
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0774">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>507</span>
merely that the question of whether the rules are broken shall not be decisive, though it will be taken into account. It appears from the account of the Thompson case that the IRC regarded it as decisive. But what is special to that case is that the rules were broken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention. I wonder whether this is just as it appears on the surface or whether there could be something slightly more sinister behind it. Is it expected that in future there will be many appeals against procedures in closed shops? Is this to be a major attack on the closed shop—in which case there will be numerous appeals—or do we merely expect the usual number of cases?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we ask how many there have been, we find that there have been so few that no one can remember them. I think that there have been four in recorded history. The one case that was brought to light was dealt with satisfactorily through the IRC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have sympathy for the Minister when he says that the trade unions could take a long time. I should have no great objection to his seeking to put a time limit on the trade union's voluntary procedure. He might be willing to reconsider things on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Needham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I draw the Committee's attention to what it seems to me we are trying to achieve? The reason for going along the voluntary path is that it is more likely than the legal path to lead to an amicable solution. We aim to ensure that the individual involved—Mr. Thompson, perhaps—will be able to go back to his job or will have another job and find himself again happily employed. There is a strong argument for voluntary procedures because at the end of the day that is most likely to be accepted by his colleagues and it is his colleagues with whom he has to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To preclude that or to allow him another course of action may make him financially better off in the short term but may make it more difficult for him in the long term to return to where he would wish most to go. Therefore, it seems to me important to try to follow the path of voluntary action and not to stand in the way of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point made by my hon. and learned Friend about the time element is certainly valid. Would it be possible to put an element of timing in it? The other point
	<span class='label label-info column'>508</span>
is that the longer it takes to go through the voluntary procedures, the greater will be the compensation the union will have to pay out in the end if it is found to be wrong by the tribunal. There is, therefore, a pressure on the trade unions, surely, in their own interests to move as fast as they can since if they do not they will lose considerable sums of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, on the two cases it seems to me that, first, the voluntary method is best because it is most likely to help the person involved, and second, because there would be pressure on the union to settle to save its funds, a time limit is worth considering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. As he says, there is pressure on the trade union to expedite the matter through the voluntary system for the very reasons he has mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was sorry that the Under-Secretary was not able to accept the spirit of the amendment and tell us that he would try to find a form of words to meet it. Some of his objections do not stand up. When talking about the time problem, I understand him to be saying that the appeal tribunal had a time limit placed upon it by this clause. I cannot see where a time limit is imposed on the tribunal to resolve a complaint brought before it. The only time limit I can see is the limit imposed on an applicant or complainant in putting his complaint to the tribunal. That is a three-months limit, which can be extended if the tribunal feels that it would be reasonable to do so. As far as I can see, there is nothing in the clause which says that the matter must be resolved by the tribunal within X weeks or X months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend is right in that, and if a tribunal has heard a case which then goes on appeal to the EAT, we can be talking about a considerable time. Quite apart from the voluntary procedures, on the Government's proposition it could in some cases be a long time before a final decision was reached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Member like to deal with what would be a suitable time limit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is quite right, because if we once get into the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0775">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>509</span>
realm of further appeals it can last a very long time indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman puts to me that I ought to suggest what should be a proper time limit. May I throw back to him his own form of words in subsection (9)(	<i>a</i>) which refers to applications for membership—
	<br><blockquote><p>"if an application for membership of a trade union has been neither granted nor rejected before the end of the period within which it might reasonably have been expected to be granted if it was to be granted".</p></blockquote>
If that is a suitable form of words for an application for membership being deemed not to have been granted, a similar form of words would, surely, be acceptable to him as a time limit for the trade unions to deal with an application that is current.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition objected to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has converted us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman appears to forget that we did not raise any real objection to subsection (9)(	<i>a</i>). There was an amendment, but we were mostly concerned about subsection (9)(	<i>b</i>). I do not recall any of my hon. or right hon. Friends saying anything about paragraph (	<i>a</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether he likes it or not, that is the Minister's preference as a form of words in that case, and surely it would do for this as well. I do not feel that he has made out any proper objection to accepting the principle or the spirit of our amendment. Clearly, at least one of his own hon. Friends feels that he ought to do so. I hope that even at this late stage he will tell us that he is able to accept the spirit of it and thus avoid the necessity for a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Madel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to comment on what has been said about a time limit. I gather that there would be no objection to a time limit being put down because it would be an encouragement to the trade unions to proceed by the voluntary process before going to the industrial tribunal and using the mechanisms of law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One point we are wandering around is what would be a reasonable time limit. Earlier in the clause, subsection (6) says:
	<span class='label label-info column'>510</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"A tribunal shall not entertain a complaint under this section unless it is presented to the tribunal before the end of the period of three months beginning with the date of the refusal or expulsion."</p></blockquote>
My own view is that three months is too short, for two reasons. We have been round this track on the Employment Protection Bill. First, if the three months starts on 1 July, that is no good at all. Summer holidays intervene, certain towns and areas close down. Another important point is that June, July and August are the months of trade union conferences and, as I know from my experience of trade unions, the union apparatus is very much tied up with organising a conference. I gave 1 July as an example because that three months would take in September when the TUC conference is held. This also is a time-consumer for the trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one further reason why I think three months is too short. Amendment No. 36 itself reads in part:
	<br><blockquote><p>"who has not exhausted any appropriate internal appeals procedure of that union".</p></blockquote>
The union may change its appeals procedure. It may decide to look at it, and that may be a fairly lengthy process. Then it would have to go to a rules revision conference, and there might have to be a special conference for it. The TUC also might like to look in due course at the workings of the independent review committee. That itself would take time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intervene only because of the discussion about time. I would say that six months is a minimum. It may need to be more. Three months is too short, especially for the reasons I have given. Matters never occur in a nice logical order. Difficulties often arise in July, in this place as well, and therefore three months is too short. Six months is about right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that if we can find the right form of words, we should like, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) rightly said, the voluntary procedure to be automatically used first. We can then move on, provided that there is reasonable time for the voluntary procedure to be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the observations of the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Madel) indicate that we may be moving some way towards a consensus. Even if the Under-Secretary is not able to accept the pellucid logic of my hon. Friend
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0776">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>511</span>
the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) about a reasonable period, which he used on a previous occasion, may I suggest—I shall not argue about the length of the period; the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, South has strong views and we can argue about that another time—that it would be open to the hon. and learned Gentleman to accept amendment No. 36 with the addition of some such words as "provided that no person may be precluded from making a complaint against the trade union under this section within X months of his invoking the internal appeals procedure of that union". Is there not a possible way out there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the care that has been taken by the right hon. and hon. Gentlemen in the speeches that have been made. They have illustrated very clearly the points that arise. I am very sympathetic to those who say they do not want to undermine self-regulatory procedures; I reiterate that and I hope that it is accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, I am concerned that we should not force somebody to accept a period of exclusion from a union—with the consequence that that has for him in a closed shop—because he has to go through what may be lengthy voluntary procedures. That is the dilemma which we face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the day, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) says, if he wins all the way along the line and ultimately goes to the tribunal he will get more compensation. That is all right, but money is not the whole thing. What about the intervening period where there is no work? That is something that must be borne in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also influenced by the fact that no Government since the institution of unfair dismissal has thought it right to apply a parallel provision there, to say that the right to go on to an industrial tribunal and to claim compensation for unfair dismissal must wait upon the following through of all the union procedures in that case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are no union procedures on unfair dismissal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg the Committee's pardon. I should have said internal procedures, not union procedures. I am referring to agreed procedures for follow-
	<span class='label label-info column'>512</span>
ing disputes with employers, and so forth. That is something that should be borne in mind. However, it has been put forward that the proposal might be acceptable if there were to be some provision—some qualification, as the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) said—that nobody should be precluded from following his rights before the industrial tribunal, and ultimately the employment appeal tribunal, if after a certain period of months the voluntary procedures had not been carried through to a determination. That is obviously worth considering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have set out in a fair manner the opposing forces and considerations that have to be weighed by the Government. I believe that the right way for me to approach this is to say that we shall consider what has been said and see whether it is possible to qualify the provision in a way similar to that most recently suggested by the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I must say that I do this without commitment. I am very much influenced by the need to ensure that there is a relatively speedy access to the tribunal that can award compensation, because justice delayed is justice denied. That, at the end of the day, may prove to be the predominating factor in the consideration that we give to the proposal. We shall consider the points that have been made, and especially the possibiliy of introducing a time limit for the operation of voluntary procedures. However, any such time limit would in many cases quite seriously curtail the length of time that is sometimes taken, and I think that it might well exclude the operation of the independent review committee, because the IRC cannot by its own terms of reference take hold of a case until the union's voluntary procedures have been completed. It may have that consequence, and whether that is desirable or not is another matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is fair enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that that is fair enough. At least, we would not be precluding the voluntary arrangements within a union. If it is clearly understood that these are genuine anxieties, then on that undertaking perhaps it may be possible for the amendment to be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

All members of the Committee are well aware of the difficulty regarding the time factor. One point that has not perhaps been taken into account is that the cases that are being dealt with by the tribunal—going through the machine—may well be speeded up if we are able to reduce its backlog through having more cases dealt with by the unions and therefore not getting into the tribunal machine at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Over the years the courts—particularly the Court of Appeal under Lord Denning—have shown great ability, ingenuity, skill and inventiveness in finding a whole new range of unlawful acts, in creating a new range of torts with which they can, and have, granted injunctions and awarded damages against trade unionists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that this is an appropriate occasion for tracing the history of the coming into being of the 1974 and 1976 trade union and labour relations Acts. I have a feeling that later on in our discussions those Acts and the law in relation to them may be discussed more and more. The fact is that those Acts were put on the statute book as a result of the courts inventing these new torts, so that trade unionists who had previously thought they were acting in a lawful manner were deemed to have acted in an unlawful manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that the High Court or the Court of Appeal may not say that acts in breach of clause 3 or in breach of clause 6 were in themselves unlawful acts, and which by being so declared would therefore become torts, the courts thus being enabled to grant an injunction or to award damages against trade unionists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the case of a breach of clause 3, where union members threaten their employer that they will strike unless someone with whom they are working is refused admittance to the union. In such a case the official and union members are protected at present, as I understand it, by section 13 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act because they acted—these are the magic words—
	<br><blockquote><p>"in…furtherance of a trade dispute</p></blockquote>
in threatening to break or interfere with their employment contracts. I think that must be the case. But if the High Court or Court of Appeal decided that a threat to compel or actual compelling of an unreasonable exclusion from a union was unlawful means in the law of tort, therefore creating a new tort, a new form of civil wrongdoing, trade unionists would lose the protection of section 13 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act. They would no longer be protected by it. In view of the fact that the Government intend to take away the immunity in respect of breach of commercial contracts, and in view of the fact that it would cer-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0778">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>515</span>
tainly be easy for the courts to invent an unlawful means and thereby hold that a trade union was in breach of a commercial contract indirectly, these words are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I say anything further, I should be interested to hear the Minister's observations. Surely he wants to make the law clear. He does not want to open up a new range of torts which the trade unions cannot understand. He surely does not wish the courts to penalise trade unions in the form of damages, or in granting injunctions when they are carrying out what they certainly consider to be normal and lawful parts of normal trade union activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be very interested to hear the Minister's views. As I read the law, the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the avoidance of doubt"</p></blockquote>
are necessary otherwise a loophole is opened up which only subsequent legislation, after certain industrial wrangling, can overcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that this matter needs careful examination. However, I believe that the problem, in the end, resolves itself into a fairly simple compass. In clause 3 we are talking about a right not to be unreasonably expelled from one's union. We are concerned also that that right shall have an enforceable remedy. If one is given a right not to be expelled unreasonably, then it follows that if one is expelled unreasonably from one's union, something unlawful has occurred. With this amendment we are now considering a proposal that would declare that a threat to do that which would be unlawful shall not itself be an unlawful act, nor shall it amount to unlawful means for the purpose of founding an action in tort itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two considerations here. First, it is surely very unlikely in practice that a threat to expel, in circumstances that would be wholly unreasonable, would be made. It is very unlikely that somebody would be able to produce evidence to a tribunal that he has been threatened with expulsion in circumstances that would plainly be unreasonable. I believe that to be very unlikely. However, let us suppose that such case can be envisaged. Then it has to be asked why it should not carry with it the remedies that the threat of any other unlawful act carries in our law. Why should somebody be made to wait until
	<span class='label label-info column'>516</span>
that threat is carried into execution, with the consequence in a closed shop that he loses his job and loses his ability to earn his living, particularly when it is much harder to get reinstated in one's job once it has been lost? One has been replaced by a successor. Is it not better law that one should have the opportunity in these unlikely circumstances to say to the court "This is threatened. This is what they say that they are going to do to me. They are going to deprive me of what section 3 of the 1980 Act confers on me, namely, a right not to be unreasonably expelled from my union. They say they are going to do this. It would plainly be unreasonable. Please stop them from doing it by injunction."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the difficulty I see in the way of the amendment. Having put it in a fairly short compass, I will expand upon it. The effect of the amendment is to make clear that an act done in contravention of the new right of an individual in the circumstances of the closed shop not to be unreasonably expelled or excluded from a trade union shall not be regarded for the purpose of establishing liability in tort as the doing of an unlawful act or the use of unlawful means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the basis of experience, to date with existing statutory rights, the amendment seems unnecessary. In any case, if an individual tried to test the existence of a liability in tort, there would be great difficulty in showing that the conspiracy or the intimidation was to expel or to exclude unreasonably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is unnecessary because it seeks to provide for an extremely unlikely eventuality. In theory, there may be some legal doubt as to whether breach of a statutory right can be regarded as an unlawful act or unlawful means for the purpose of establishing liability in tort. But there are a large number of rights created by statute in which this sort of problem might arise—for example, unfair dismissal, maternity or guarantee pay. Yet neither in the 1974 nor the 1975 and 1978 Acts was it felt necessary to deal with the point. While the possibility of establishing liability in tort cannot be ruled out, it was so ruled out by Lord Denning in Cory Lighterage and the TGWU in 1973, which was a case involving unfair industrial practices under the 1971 Act. That is one authority, and I think the only authority, but nevertheless there may be doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, because of the existence of rights under other legislation, if it were
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0779">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>517</span>
thought necessary to remove any possible doubt, which the Government are not persuaded is the case, this would be more appropriately done by way of a general provision covering them all than by a specific provision covering this particular right. Otherwise, although a theoretical question in respect of this particular statutory right might be laid to rest, greater doubt would be created elsewhere. The hon. and learned Gentleman is signifying his assent to that proposition. The question would be asked "Why is there not a similar provision in respect of this other right?", but the case has not been made out for undertaking such a course for the sake of certain theoretical problems which may not in practice arise, or could arise only very seldom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, moreover, difficult to envisage a situation where an individual would wish to test this issue by suing in tort. Intimidation on the picket line is perhaps the most realistic example, although here also the difficulties are formidable, in particular establishing that the threat was to expel unreasonably. At present, an act that is done in contravention of an individual's common law rights not to be expelled from his union contrary to rule or the requirements of natural justice might be regarded as unlawful intimidation. So far as is known, however, there have been no attempts to seek to establish this, nor has any provision ruling out the possibility been felt necessary. This perhaps illustrates that threats are not made in this form, that it would be difficult to establish that a threat of this nature had been made, or, if any had been, in practice to prevent it. The same can be said of threats of unreasonable expulsion or exclusion. In the period of about 18 months to which I have already referred, when section 5 of the 1974 Act operated, no attempts were made to injunct threats of expulsion by way of arbitrary or unreasonable discrimination, which was the criterion applied by section 5. Certain cases were brought, and I have reminded the Committee of them today, but no attempts were made to injunct threats of expulsion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6. 30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been argued in Lord Wedderburn's pamphlet that industrial action which contravened the new statutory rights might be held to be itself illegal. This is not so. A strike to secure the dismissal of an
	<span class='label label-info column'>518</span>
employee held to have been unreasonably excluded from a union would not infrigne this right not to be unreasonably excluded. He has the right not to be unreasonably excluded. He has that right irrespective of what action his fellow employees take, and they cannot deprive him of it. Inducing a breach of contract of employment is the means by which such a strike is brought about. Any possible effect upon the man's statutory rights does not come into it as the means used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that I have had to take a little time in a perhaps slightly turgid exposition. I come back to what I said at the outset, that there is doubt here on the law. The only authority of which I am aware, the Cory case, goes against the proposition which the hon. and learned Gentleman seeks to guard against.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also unlikley in practice that this situation will arise. But if it does arise and if the Cory authority is not found to be reliable, I am not aware of really persuasive reason why, if a threat to do something unlawful is made against a union member, he should not have recourse to the redress which, in other fields of the law. he has, and why he should not be able to say " I want this stopped, please, before it takes effect and I am thrown out of my union and thence out of my job."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, although I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for the way in which he has proposed the amendment, the Government are not persuaded that it would be right to accede to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point that the hon. and learned Gentleman has made, that this doubt arises in many clauses of the Bill and in a sense it would be better to put in a blanket "avoidance of doubt" clause. Certainly I do not think that the hon. and learned Gentleman, with his skill, could not find drafting faults in the amendment. I am not as sanguine as he is about the inability of the courts to find an unlawful act in something that they might think unlawful but that the trade unions might regard as perfectly in order. I would like him to study carefully what he has said. I am grateful to him for giving such a full exposition. He says it was turgid. If it was turgid, it was very full and detailed. It is an important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the fact that the hon. and learned Gentleman admits that there is a doubt, I would not wish to urge my right hon. and hon. Friends to press the amend-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0780">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>519</span>
ment. Perhaps we could come to it on another occasion. I would like him to look at it very carefully. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 42, in page 5, line 27, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(12) Any tribunal, including the Employment Appeal Tribunal dealing with any application under this section or section 4 below shall not include any person appointed as a representative of employers or organisation of employers</p></blockquote>
The amendment is obvious and requires little explanation from me. Its intent and justification should be equally clear. What we are talking about in this clause is the relationship and the possible conflict between an individual and a trade union. Why employers should in any way be involved in this conflict, and its resolution, I cannot understand. I doubt very much if the employers themselves would want to be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I see it, to have the industrial tribunal as at present constituted making decisions on the matters that we have been discussing is rather as if the body which is to choose the Liverpool team to play in the FA Cup against Tottenham had to have upon it a representative of Tottenham. It is clearly daft that the employers should be brought into this. Clearly, they are in an adversary position. By that I do not mean that employers and trade unions are inevitably inherently at loggerheads, but there is essentially an adversary position here, which I am sure the employer would not see as being helped in any way by he or his representative being brought willy-nilly into a situation which he probably feels does not involve him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, with those few remarks, that the good sense of what we propose will be accepted by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not quite as simple as the right hon. Gentleman suggests. What is inherent in this proposal is that the members of industrial and employment appeal tribunals, who are nominees of the CBI, are not capable of dispassionately and impartially determining the issue under clause 3. The criterion is reasonableness, and it has to be determined according to the equity and general merits of the case. It is a pretty serious expression of no confidence if Parliament says that in this
	<span class='label label-info column'>520</span>
particular part of its jurisdiction employers' representatives are not able to be trusted to employ the criterion of equity or to determine the general merits of the case, and that they are not able to determine or to discern what is reasonable and what is unreasonable. It is making substantial and dangerous inroad upon the tripartite basis of the tribunals, to which the right hon. Gentleman himself paid tribute at our last sitting, if we say "Here is something they really can't be trusted with." It is not too difficult to think of circumstances in which employers might be tempted to advance the same proposition and say "Here are cases in which the trade union representatives can't be trusted."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real thing that we have in our hands here is a precious system for dealing in an impartial and relatively informal way—not sufficiently informal, I am afraid, in many cases—with the disputes that arise in modern industrial life. We have managed to construct a very precious system—although it is certainly capable of being improved—of tribunals which by and large have the confidence of all concerned and which are founded upon representatives from the employers' side and from the trade union side, and have at the head of the triangle an impartial, independent and professionally qualified chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once one starts to say "I am afraid that in this part of your jurisdiction you as employers' representatives can't really be trusted", one has inserted a wedge, and there will be those who will wish to drive that wedge further and to say "Here, too, afraid, you really ought not to be allowed to sit." Where would it stop? Would it perhaps extend to the chairman? Someone might say "I am afraid you cannot be expected to know anything about this, chairman, because after all you have never been a member of a trade union, so we must have as the chairman of the tribunal only a union representative." That would do grave damage to this relatively newly created but quite successful structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will reflect that it is not quite as simple as it may have appeared when he put the case for the amendment. I understand those who, when talking about whether it is reasonable to throw someone out of a union or not, to exclude him from a union, would say "Who could know better than trade union members?" I dare say that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0781">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>521</span>
it is right that nobody would know better about it than trade union members. I am prepared to argue that. But that is not to say that those in the tribunals at the moment do not know enough about the concepts of equity and of reasonableness to be able to fulfil their duties in this part of their jurisdiction just as well as in any other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must tell the hon. and learned Gentleman that he has been totally unconvincing. He has failed to recognise that in nearly all their other jurisdictions the industrial tribunals and the employment appeal tribunals are dealing with matters that arise essentially from the employer versus employee relationship, from the trade union versus employer adversary situation. The only possible exception is where the industrial tribunals are carrying out what was their initial function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman says that the tribunals are relatively new. Their jurisdictions are relatively new, but the tribunals were in fact established consequent upon the passing of the Industrial Training Act 1964 to make decisions about industrial training levies. It might be argued that because the employer pays a levy, the trade unions are sitting on a tribunal which is primarily an interest of the employer. That is wide open to question. The composition of training boards themselves, which determine the levies, reflects the two sides approach of industry—trade unions and employers together jointly represented amongst others on the industrial training boards. I cannot think of any other situation where the tribunal would be dealing with matters arising essentially from one side of the two interests primarily represented within the tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman is quite right about the composition of the tribunal. It is composed and structured in the way it is in order to reflect and have regard to what I have described as this two sides of industry dichotomy, this adversary situation. We have an entirely different field here—something totally new. It would be offensive to most trade unionists, if not all of them, to have employers sitting on a body which is not merely, as the hon. and learned Gentleman would have it, making decisions about equity but is also interpreting and making recommendations
	<span class='label label-info column'>522</span>
about the rules of a trade union. That is what we have in this clause. The tribunal will also perhaps make recommendations about when the rules are wrong and should be changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman said this morning that when the tribunal found a situation where the rules were unreasonably onerous upon a particular applicant before it, perhaps the union ought to be told by the tribunal to change its rules—with the employer sitting alongside one of his learned friends and the poor trade union representative in the minority. I do not criticise those who participate in tribunals. The hon. and learned Gentleman is quite right to remind the Committee of my support for the work the tribunals do and the whole concept they represent. That does not mean to say that because I am enthusiastic about the idea of industrial tribunals I should be inhibited from saying that I do not think they have a proper role to play here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The corollary of what we have proposed here as an amendment in clause 3 was that which was contained in my amendment, which was not called for debate—amendment No. 45 to clause 4. I am making no complaints, Mr. Goodhew, but you have not called it. It is clearly a matter for your good judgment and your discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we adopted a rather different formula—the suggestion that we might have a special committee. The hon. and learned Gentleman said that we do not want to start messing about with tribunals in the way that I am proposing. That in no way diminishes the logic and force of the argument I presented to the Committee. He could equally usefully and constructively respond by saying "None the less, we shall look at whether there is not a case for an entirely different and new body to deal with this problem on which there would not be employers who we feel ought not to be involved in internal trade union affairs."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we came before this Committee with amendments designed to give trade unions a role in the internal affairs of employers' associations, what kind of reaction should we receive? We shall be told that it was absurd. Yet that is tantamount to what the Government is saying to us—that in one of the most sensitive areas, the interpretation of the rules of a union, the employers have a role to play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0782">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>523</span>
The Government are bringing forward a recipe for further conflict and ill feeling. I ask them to bear in mind the embarrassment and the invidious position of an employer sitting on one of these cases where the tribunal makes recommendations about a union rule implying adverse criticism. It will lead to all kinds of difficulties for the union Those outside interested in the decision of the tribunal will not know who voted which way within the tribunal. That is not known outside: it is contrary to the way they proceed. It may well have been a 2 to I vote, but nobody will know whether it was the employer and the chairman or the trade unionist and the chairman who constituted the two. Suspicion would immediately arise. The difficulties an employer already often faces in relation to a particular trade union will be intensified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be other difficulties which we have not sought to tackle arising from the differences of approach between unions. I touched on this at an earlier sitting. We have to be frank about the difficulties that may well arise from the tensions that sometimes occur between a craft union and a general workers' union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Difficulties may arise from a representative of a general workers' union sitting on a tribunal dealing with the rules of a craft union and being all too eager to see inroads made. I shall not dwell on that, but if that difficulty exists one has only to think how much greater the difficulties will be when an employer dragged into that kind of situation may well have a good, sensible employer's vested interest in being critical of the rules of a union which have an adverse effect on the conduct of his undertaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am seeking to diminish the scope for conflict. The whole process is objectionable to us. We are registering these general objections now and we shall register them by voting on clause stand part. But on the assumption that we shall have this imposed on us and on the trade union movement anyhow, I am anxious that the Minister should be saved from stepping into pitfalls that he may be unaware of. He may be versed in the law but he does not have the close association with these practical problems of industrial relations that some of my hon. Friends have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman's experience in this field is well respected and known to be enormous. Is it
	<span class='label label-info column'>524</span>
not felt in the whole structure of industrial tribunals that both trade union representatives and employers' representatives are honourable men or women, and that one of the great strengths of the industrial tribunal is that they each look at the problems of the other side that may arise, often in different ways, with an open mind and with that balance of approach which comes from having someone from the employers' side and someone from the employees' side?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We talk about exclusion from trade union membership, but it is not the exclusion of an employee or a potential employee from trade union membership genuinely and properly of interest to employers in principle? Could the right hon. Gentleman deal with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I have dealt with it by pointing out the difficulties that are likely to arise both for the employer and for industrial relations, with the heightening of suspicion about the role that an employer may have played in a particular decision. Of course, he may not; no one is likely to know. The decision is handed down and there will be the assumption that the employer has played a role. He will have to live with that afterwards, and he will raise suspicions and diminish the confidence that I want the industrial tribunals to enjoy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If one accepts that it is right that there should be an enforceable remedy when one is unreasonably excluded from one's union, there follows the question of what tribunal, forum or court shall determine the issue. It is not enough for us simply to say that if a person is unreasonably flung out of his union he should have a claim. We must go on and say how that claim is to be decided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the right hon. Gentleman has to take consultation and so on but I want him to understand what is in the Government's mind on this, and I am trying to express it briefly. In the first instance, it was in the Government's mind that the High Court should have jurisdiction here, and we certainly do not go along with the expressions of lack of confidence in the High Court that from time to time nowadays are heard from the Opposition. I was sorry to hear even my old friend the hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) say that the courts had
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0783">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>525</span>
shown great skill in finding new torts, as though they wanted to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the approach that we take towards the way that the courts go about their business of protecting the liberties of people under the law. But we had regard to a certain unease that we know exists concerning the bringing of the civil courts into issues of industrial relations. Accordingly, we thought that on balance, and without acceding to those criticisms, it would be better for this jurisdiction to be held by the industrial tribunals and by the employment appeal tribunal. Why?—because of their familiarity with the industrial world. So the choice really limits itself, on the one hand, to the High Court—or, I suppose, one could say the county court though I dare say that that would not be regarded as very different in character—or, on the other hand, the industrial tribunals and the EAT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one says that the EAT or the industrial tribunal has to be specially constituted if it is to have this jurisdiction, that must be justified, and it needs a very special justification because one undermines the reputation for impartiality of not only the tribunal but its members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What was the justification put up by the right hon. Gentleman? He says that this is an internal trade union affair. But it is not. This is at the root of the issue. If it were an internal trade union affair there would have to be no consequence for the employee other than that he remained, or did not remain, in the union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point of this jurisdiction and the right that the Bill is intended to confer is that it applies only in the context of the closed shop. So it cannot be said to be a purely internal union affair as to whether an individual fellow-citizen should be able to pursue the only trade that he knows when he can pursue it only in a closed shop organised industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the right hon. Gentleman has to advance the amendment on the basis that we are dealing solely with an internal trade union affair and it should be the prerogative only of trade union members to decide it in the tribunal, but that must fail. That is fundamental. I suggested that one would be driving in a wedge because other people would say that they, too, must have special consideration for particular types of claim. Conceivably, women might argue that men should not sit on tribunals
	<span class='label label-info column'>526</span>
hearing cases relating to discrimination on grounds of sex. Why not? Once the principle has been conceded that one must have only people who really understand the delicate nuances of a particular case, one has opened a dangerous door.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There might be similar arguments when a racial case is heard, because the tribunals have jurisdiction there. A coloured man may say "I want a coloured tribunal". It does not do any service to those who sit on tribunals to put forward those arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that I am right in saying that 96 per cent. of all the cases that are heard by industrial tribunals are determined unanimously. This seems to be a measure of the way in which those who sit on these panels put aside partisan prejudice or any bias that may come from their own particular interests. It ought to be sufficient proof that the tribunal members, once they are chosen, sit as impartial judges and not as representatives of any special faction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances, I feel quite confident in recommending my hon. Friends to vote against this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may add this, since I recognise the anxiety that the right hon. Gentleman expressed about certain representatives of employers—they are chosen not from the CBI but from the Retail Consortium and three or four other representative organisations of employers—possibly having some special interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say with complete assurance that the Committee can be entirely confident that the presidents of tribunals would select the members of the panels to hear these rather unusual cases with the greatest care and with the greatest concern to ensure that there was patent and obvious impartiality. Any employer's representative who found himself with any interest or axe to grind would declare it and remove himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore think that we are faced with an important issue, not quite as simple as first appeared when the right hon. Gentleman spoke, and we must firmly resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
