<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>EMPLOYMENT BILL</h1></div>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we commence our proceedings, I should make it clear to hon. Members who may not have discovered it already that copies are available of the Government's working paper on secondary industrial action, which is published today. The Secretary of State wishes to rise on a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. James Prior)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I say, Mr. Goodhew, how pleased we are to see you back in the chair?<br><br>
On a point of order, Mr. Goodhew I wish to make a statement to the Committee. Later today I shall be publishing a working paper setting out the Government's consultative proposals on the subject of secondary industrial action. The working paper makes clear that we are continuing with our review of the law on trade union immunities, and we intend to publish a Green Paper later this year as a basis for public debate. It also contains proposals for changes in the law which the Government believe are urgently necessary in the light of the recent House of Lords judgment, particularly in the case of Express Newspapers versus MacShane. When we have completed our consultations I intend to table an amendment to the Bill. As I undertook to do—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could my right hon. Friend speak a little louder?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we have completed our consultations I intend to table an amendment to the Bill. As I undertook to do, I have made available copies of the working paper for all members of the Committee. Copies will also be available in the Library of the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eric G. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Goodhew, I am grateful to the Secretary of State for giving the Committee a little notice before the document is for publication. It would be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 428</span>
out of order to debate it now, I presume, Mr. Goodhew, but could the Secretary of State help the Committee by rising on a further point of order to tell us when he expects his consultative period to come to an end, because that will vitally affect the consideration of the clauses? For example, will it take four weeks, or six weeks? Can he give us any indication?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Goodhew. The consultation period is due to end on 21st March. For the convenience of the Committee, the consultative document sets out all that would be likely to be contained in any future clause that would be moved to be added to the Bill. The Committee should now be able to proceed with its work in the knowledge that it has all the facts that are available in front of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Goodhew. With respect to the Secretary of State, what he has said is anything but satisfactory. I had some difficulty at the outset in hearing the words he uttered, and I thought I heard him say that he would table the clauses later this year. Would he give us some indication of when "later this year" is? I appreciate that next week is later this year, but as we are in some disarray over the conduct of the Bill, in that half-way through the Bill we are to have a consultation on new proposals to it—which is not in accordance with the way the House normally does things—and given that the Government have been in office since May of last year and that the Employment Bill has been one of their prime considerations—indeed, someone suggested that it was one of the major issues on which they fought the last general election—one would have assumed that they would have some idea about the road on which they were embarking when they printed the Bill in the first instance.<br><br>
Could the Secretary of State give us further explanation on the question by my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley), as to how long the consultation period will be? Are we talking of a period of three weeks, four weeks, six weeks, eight weeks? At what stage are we likely to consider the clauses? Is it the Secretary of State's intention that the new clauses will be tabled separately from the Bill, will be tabled on the Floor of the House, and will be debated
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0733">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 429</span>
by the whole House, or is it his intention to table new clauses which will at some stage be brought to the Committee. That has great bearing on the length of time that the Committee will need to sit.<br><br>
Last week we passed a sittings motion, and we now have four sittings a week. In view, however, of the time scale of which the Secretary of State is now talking, it is absolutely necessary for the Committee to meet for four sittings a week?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot debate this at length. I have allowed a certain amount of discussion on the basis of points of order. Let me assure the hon. Member that there is nothing unusual in new clauses of amendments being put down during the course of the Committee stage. If the chairman were to refuse to accept such new clauses of amendments, the Opposition would be in a very bad way, and hon. and right hon. Members would be round his neck in no time. I want to assure the hon. Member that there is nothing unusual about that. The Secretary of State may wish to say what the time scale is, but we cannot debate it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate, Mr. Goodhew, that tabling new clauses is something that happens to most Bills, but, with respect, tabling consultation papers half-way through a Bill is not the normal practice of the House. Consultation papers, at least in the few years that I have been a Member of Parliament, are normally tabled months before the Bill is printed, not half-way through it.<br><br>
May I then ask the Secretary of State [<i>Interruption.</i>] With respect, I would sooner hon. Gentlemans opposite sometimes had a go in the Committee; then we might proceed on a more amicable basis. I ask the Secretary to give us some idea of the time scale, and to tell us whether it is necessary for the Committee to go on with the extended sittings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise if hon. Gentlemen did not hear everything I was saying. There was a lot of noise at the time, I suspect because hon. Members were coming into the Committee. I apologise if they did not catch the exact words I was saying. I said that when we have completed our consultations I intend to table an amendment to the Bill, and I have told the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley),
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 430</span>
in reply to his point of order, that the consultations will be finished by 21st March.<br><br>
In answer to the hon. Gentleman's other points, it would then be proposed that we put down a new clause for discussion within the Bill. I would thought it for the convenience of the Committee, and for the House, if we discussed how best to proceed on this through the usual channels and came to a decision on that. Certainly the new clause is well within the scope of the Bill, and, as you yourself have said, Mr. Goodhew, there is nothing unusual about a new clause being tabled to a Bill. In fact, what we are seeking to do is give the Committee a chance of looking at a consultative document well in advance of the new clause being tabled.<br><br>
My intention would be that the new clause should be tabled well in advance of being taken by the House, if that were the desire of hon. Members, and it would be better at this stage if we reserved how best to meet the convenience of hon. Members in all parts of the House of Commons before we come to a decision. I should like to leave it like that for this morning, consult about it, and report back to the Committee at a later stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Goodhew. May I ask my right hon. Friend to clarify the point about the tabling of the clause. Are we to understand that no decision has been made whether it will be tabled for discussion within the Committee or tabled so that it will first be discussed on the Floor of the House?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a matter where we have to suit the convenience of the House, and is something which I should like to discuss through the usual channels before reaching a final decision. The Government wish to do what is the best thing from the point of view of the whole House, bearing in mind that this is a matter which arouses deep passions and is very important. I know that the House itself will wish to have a chance of discussing this point. I should like to leave that, however, until we have had further discussions.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I join the right hon. Gentleman in expressing my pleasure, Mr. Goodhew, which I am sure is shared by my right hon. and hon. Friends, at your return to the Committee.<br><br>
During the course of the discussion on Thursday afternoon last on this amendment and the amendments that have been chosen to be grouped with it, the hon. and learned Gentleman the Under-Secretary paid tribute to the value in the whole field of industrial relations of the Bridlington agreement and the procedures which are carried out under that agreement. Of course, in saying what he did on that occasion, he was expressing a view which is held universally. Whatever different views people may take about other aspects of industrial relations, I do not know anybody who is not convinced that we should all be very much worse off if there were no Bridlington agreement and if the procedures at present carried out under the Bridlington agreement had to be substituted by some other form of procedure.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 432</span>
However, what we are concerned about on the Opposition side of the Committee I think it came out very clearly in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant), who moved the amendment is that without amendment the clause as it now stands would strike a grave blow and, perhaps, a mortal blow at the Bridlington agreement and its procedures.<br><br>
At the end of our proceedings last Thursday, to my horror and that of the whole Committee, the Under-Secretary intervened to move the adjournment of the debate when I was describing some of the circumstances in which the Bridlington procedures are brought into play. Of course, they are most often brought into play in connection with disputes between unions. We all recognise that all disputes are at best a necessary evil and at worst an evil, and I think we would all agree—certainly those of us who know the problem at first hand—that of all disputes the ones that are most difficult and cause the most trouble, sometimes for not very great cause, are inter-union disputes. Machinery which deals with, and nearly always succeeds in solving, such disputes without rancour and without ill-feeling is, as the Under-Secretary suggested, very valuable machinery which we should not lightly put at risk.<br><br>
At least some Conservative Members—probably not the Under-Secretary but some Conservative Members—have a distorted view about the whole subject because they see it in terms entirely of the closed shop. I said at our last sitting that closed shop situations form a very small minority of the cases which are dealt with under the Bridlington agreement, and it is, if I may say so without offence, a bit silly of Conservative Members always to be harping on the minority of cases and not paying attention to the vast majority. The trouble is that with some of them the closed shop has become no longer a matter of argument but a sort of ritual, tribal incantation. They are obsessed with it. They talk about it in almost voodoo terms, tribal hate chant, totem pole, evil eye, cult terms. It is an absolute obsession, and they cannot get away from it to look at what life is like really.<br><br>
If I may recapitulate in only a sentence or two—because I do not want to delay the Committee—the point I was making when we concluded our proceedings last Thursday, the most common case that comes up
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0735">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 433</span>
under the Bridlington agreement is something like this. There is a shop, a department, a factory, or whatever it is, in which 60 per cent. of the employees belong to a trade union which I shall call trade union A. There is some recruitment in the department, perhaps because of expansion, perhaps to replace people who have left, and there are recruited into the same department, the same area of work, the same job area, a number of people who are members of union B. These chaps come in and discover that there are a number of people in the department who are not members of a trade union and, being themselves trade unionists, and good trade unionists, they think that it would be a good idea to go about recruiting some members there.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
Here we have a situation in which there is one union with a majority of the employees in its membership—indeed, having in its membership all the employees who are members of any trade union at all—which is recognised—this is the important thing—by the employer as being the instrument with which he bargains, with which he negotiates, with which, he reaches agreement. Now we have a second union coming into this area and starting to recruit, and a dispute arises between the unions and off they go to the TUC.<br><br>
As the Under-Secretary will know, before the formal Bridlington procedures are set in train, there is always an attempt to deal with the matter by informal means, by conciliation, by getting everybody round a table and chatting, and in a remarkably high proportion of the cases that succeeds in disposing of the matter without the need to go through the formalities of the Bridlington procedures. But, in the final issue, there are the Bridlington procedures.<br><br>
There, the matter is heard by a quasi-judicial body provided by the TUC, or under the auspices of the TUC, and a finding is made. That finding is binding upon the parties. The finding might well be, in the case which I have just been describing, that union A should continue to be recognised as the bargaining agent, that union B should not seek to become a bargaining agent in that area, that it should not seek to recruit, and sometimes even that it should shed that small number of its members who are there in that department and transfer them to the other union.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 434</span>
I am not altogether clear—perhaps the Under-Secretary will tell us if he seeks to catch your eye, Mr. Goodhew, later on in the debate—whether under the clause as it is now drafted the members of union B would have a grievance and a claim in those circumstances. I suppose it all hinges on "reasonably" and "unreasonably". Who knows what would be considered to be reasonable? It is anybody's guess. I cannot guess, and the Under-Secretary cannot guess, whether anybody would say in judgment that it was reasonable for union B, in the last instance, to expel those two or three members because it had been told so to do under the Bridlington procedures.<br><br>
If that was held to be unreasonable and the members concerned had a claim, that means that nobody ever again would be able in that sort of circumstance to resort to the Bridlington procedures, and if we cannot have resort to the Bridlington procedures we shall finish up with a standup knock-down fight situation in the factory. Indeed, that stand-up knock-down situation has existed in a number of cases and has led not to very big disputes but to some very nasty and bitter disputes which employers, above all, are anxious to avoid.<br><br>
If the effect of the clause were to wreck or seriously to damage the Bridlington procedures the hon. and learned Gentleman would find nobody complaining more bitterly than employers and employers' organisations. I know that the hon. and learned Gentleman is not hide-bound and that he looks at things on their merits. I invite him to consider whether there is not a real possibility that the clause as it stands could have that effect and whether the amendment moved by my hon. Friend and the amendments related to it would prevent it from having that effect.<br><br>
What I am saying is not fanciful. It derives from seeing in practice how Bridlington works, the sort of circumstances that arise. All sorts of circumstances arise. I quoted the circumstance that I think is the most common. It is a serious point, and I invite the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. and learned Gentleman to look very closely at it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) for his speech and for the careful and very reasonable way in which he has put forward his arguments.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0736">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 435</span>
It would not be helpful if I were to reiterate the broad points that I made during our last sitting, but I think it is necessary that I should once again make clear that the Government see great value in the Bridlington procedures. I entirely agree that some of the most impracticable and damaging disputes are those which arise out of competition between unions out of the blurred margins or frontiers between recruiting areas and so forth. They are damaging not only to the members of the union concerned but to a much wider area—those who employ members of the unions concerned, and so forth. Therefore, it is very valuable that the trade union movement has developed the Bridlington disputes principles and procedures. I give the assurance that there is absolutely no intention in the Government's mind to undermine those procedures.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asks if we are satisfied that this clause will provide safeguards of that sort, that it will not undermine the Bridlington procedures. The answer is: yes, we are. But I should like to explain why we take that view.<br><br>
The key to the clause is the concept of what is reasonable and unreasonable. The Government take the view, and are widely supported in this, not least among trade union members, that it is not sufficient to enable a union member who believes that he is unjustly or unreasonably excluded from his union in a closed shop simply to get a declaration from some independent body that that is indeed the case, or even a recommendation that he should be reinstated.<br><br>
The Government take the view that he ought to have an enforceable remedy. That is why we have drafted clause 3 and incorporated it in the Bill in the way that we have. It provides a new remedy against a union in those circumstances, and one which is enforceable by a claim for compensation against the union concerned if the complaint is made out. The jurisdiction lies with the industrial tribunal in the first instance for the declaration. If that declaration is granted, the union then has an opportunity to act upon it. If it does not act upon it within the period set out in the clause, the complainant goes, if he wishes, to the employment appeal tribunal and says, "Compensate me, please. Grant compensation because the claim has been made out, a declaration has been granted, but the union has not acted upon it."<br><br>
The key is the concept of what is un-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 436</span>
reasonable. As I indicated last time, that is not an unusual or a novel concept for industrial tribunals. It is what they deal with more than anything else. I think that 83 per cent. of all industrial tribunal work is concerned with unfair dismissal, and we know that at the centre of that is the concept of what is reasonable and unreasonable. I say that as the first ground for reassuring the hon. Gentleman, that there is nothing here to undermine the Bridlington procedures.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman then helpfully reminded us of the illustration that he gave at our last sitting of the work force which is 60 per cent. organised as members of union A and 40 per cent. unorganised. Then a few keen members of union B start to recruit, and a dispute arises. In the circumstances which the hon. Gentleman put forward of the Bridlington procedures being operated and, as a result, union B being required to expel two or three members, that would be a matter for the industrial tribunal and, on appeal—if an appeal were made—the employment appeal tribunal.<br><br>
But I should be very surprised if any tribunal in those circumstances said that this expulsion was unreasonable. That would be so without any code of practice. But, as has been made clear, my right hon. Friend proposes to issue a code of practice, after consultation with ACAS, on the operation of the closed shop, and that code of practice will certainly contain practical guidance as to the significance of the Bridlington agreements, the disputes principles and procedures. That reinforces the view that I have just expressed as to the attitude that an industrial tribunal would take in those circumstances.<br><br>
That, by itself, would not be sufficient to justify resisting these amendments, in particular the first amendment by the hon. Gentleman. If no harm were to be done by that amendment or these amendments, I do not think it would be worth—if I may put it this way—resisting them. But the difficulty about the amendment is that it is not only unnecessary for the reason that I have suggested, that any tribunal will have regard immediately to what the Bridlington disputes procedures may have produced—it will in any event—but, by specifying that it shall have regard to this, one runs into the old problem of interpretation—that if Parliament has thought it right to include this, why did it think it right to exclude the other?
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0737">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 437</span>
Accordingly, we think it is not only unnecessary but positively dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary of State says "to exclude the other". I am not clear what he means by that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If one says one "should have regard", there are circumstances where one can visualise that it may be proper to run the risk. But if Parliament has in one clause said that one should have regard to this, circumstances arise in which the question is asked, "Why did it not say 'have regard to the other'?" There are certain circumstances where this type of drafting is desirable—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Regard to what?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—have regard to the procedures that have been followed, or any other relevant circumstance. One could have regard to an innumerable number of relevant circumstances when deciding whether or not expulsion is unreasonable. But it is not generally desirable to include one circumstance out of a number that would be relevant, because it gives rise to that sort of question.<br><br>
I revert to the illustration given by the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow. I am reminded that in the circumstances which he posited there would not be any closed shop, if there was a 60 per cent. and a 40 per cent. This jurisdiction is hinged upon a closed shop situation. But that is perhaps at the margin, because the point that the hon. Gentleman was putting forward was whether the industrial tribunal would go against the Bridlington agreement.<br><br>
Taking into account what I said last time and what I have tried to say in response to the points made today, I hope that I have made the Government's position clear on this. If the amendments are to be pressed, I must advise my right hon. and hon. Friends to resist them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a clear difference of view between the two sides of the Committee on this matter. If the hon. and learned Gentleman had told us that he would accept the first amendment and the last amendment in this group, we should have regarded that as a helpful response and would not have wished to press the other amendments. But I think that he is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 438</span>
being very foolish in rejecting the whole package, as it were. Having had a little time to look at the arguments, particularly the arguments that he put at last Thursday's sitting—he has not added to them this morning but has merely reiterated them—I think they are full of holes and contain considerable inconsistencies.<br><br>
11 a.m.<br><br>
When I moved amendment No. 24, I tried to explain that it was an attempt to safeguard agreements between employers and unions, and between unions and unions and dwelt on the Bridlington agreements in particular. I cannot agree with the hon. and learned Gentleman that his approach will not undermine Bridlington.<br><br>
The Bridlington agreements were hammered out over a period of 40 years. The TUC's "Disputes Principles and Procedures" gives the history; I shall not weary the Committee by going right through it. But it points out that, subsequent to 1939 when the Bridlington congress adopted these recommendations, they have been amended three or four times. Certainly they were supplemented in 1969. They were codified and brought together again in 1973, when there were some amendments to the principles. In 1976, the congress again revised some of the rules. The booklet which I am holding, which superseded the 1976 publication, was drawn up following the approval of the 1979 congress, when a number of important changes were made. So it has been amended and updated in the light of practical experience by the trade union movement. We have heard already from the hon. and learned Gentleman how much he values the light of experience when we have talked about other matters—in particular, codes of practice.<br><br>
All that we are seeking in the amendment is that tribunals should "have regard" to these agreements. We are not trying to impose a binding situation on them. We say that they should have regard, and that is the extent of the obligation that we are trying to create. The hon. and learned Gentleman agreed with me about the desire for self-regulation in the trade union movement. He wants this kind of statutory fail-safe procedure to fall back on.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman quoted paragraph 610 of the Donovan Commission is report in favour of his argument. He could have gone on to quote paragraph 612. I shall not read the para-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0738">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 439</span>
graph, which is very long, but it is the one which spelled out the desirability of having an independent review body. The TUC subsequently set up that independent body. I referred to that in moving the amendment.<br><br>
I am surprised that in his reply the Under-Secretary made no reference to the TUC body. He has expressed no opinion on its workings. I tried to spell out how I believed it had operated, and successfully operated. The Under-Secretary has given no indication that the Government believe that there are shortcomings in the operation of the body. He has given no cases in which the TUC committee has fallen down on the job and been unsuccessful, or produced an unsatisfactory outcome. He would find it difficult to do so, and that is probably why he has not commented on it. But he may want to come back on that.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman says in the end that this sort of thing would not be enough and that when there is a declaration there must be statutory backup. But Donovan pointed out that if a review body's decision was defied by a union it was open to the complainant, if he felt that his rights were still being withheld, to make use of the general law for breach of contract. That was the Donovan solution, and certainly nothing in Donovan is on all fours with the Government's present proposals. In any case, we have moved on from there because we have this independent review body, which has worked pretty effectively.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary also made heavy weather of the supposed conflict, as he saw it, with clause 3(11) if the amendment were accepted. The amendment would not prevent an individual, as he suggests, from exercising his right of appeal. I come back to the point that I have just made. All we say is "having regard to". I cannot read that subsection (11) would be overridden in that way. But if there is doubt in the Under-Secretary's mind, he has a simple remedy. It could not be more than a matter of a simple drafting amendment—a form of words—if the Government feel that it is important. I do not think it is, but we could overcome it without great difficulty if there were real anxiety.<br><br>
I do not see how we can be certain that tribunals will take into account existing agreements. I am inclined to agree with the hon. and learned Gentleman that it is unlikely that they would not do so. But he says that they will. His words were "in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 440</span>
every case". He cannot know that. He can only assume it, and it is a dangerous assumption. But if he is right, why not put it in? Why not make sure of it? That is all we ask.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary made a great point of the business of "reasonable" and "unreasonable". I cannot see how the amendment would affect the view of the tribunal in that situation. All we say is that it should have regard to existing agreements. There is nothing binding in that.<br><br>
I do not want to add to what I said earlier about amendments Nos. 37 and 39, but I should like to say a word or two on amendment No. 43. The Under-Secretary has effectively told us that we cannot really trust tribunals to make a judgment over existing agreements. But he now tells us that we must trust them in this situation. This final amendment provides an opportunity for this Committee, not the tribunal, to say clearly what we think is reasonable or unreasonable in these circumstances. The Under-Secretary did not argue the case very far. He could not think on Thursday afternoon, and he cannot this morning—with a situation in which, as I put it, everyone will be in agreement—the unions, the employers and the workers—about which union has membership rights when an awkward customer insists on joining a different union—of circumstances in which a tribunal would think that that individual was behaving reasonably. His argument is unconvincing. He said, as the <i>Official Report</i> records, that we in the Committee should not mislead ourselves into thinking that we can produce better law than the departmental draftsmen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I did not say that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall quote the hon. and learned Gentleman's precise words. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"However, I am anxious that the Committee should not mislead itself into thinking that it is producing better law than the clause as it stands produces."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 14 February 1979; c. 423]</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is different.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what the difference is.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not have said anything so impolite as to suggest that the Committee could not in any way improve the Bill, but it would be misleading to think that this amendment in this instance improved the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Despite the hon. and learned Gentleman's narrowing of the argument, that is precisely what we are here for—to make changes where we think we can improve on the drafting.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, on clause 1, in principle. That is the history of these Committees—to make changes of this kind.

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 25, in page 4, line 32, leave out from "case" to end of line 35.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to 'discuss the following amendments:</span></p>
<p>No. 23, in page 4, line 32, leave out from "and" to end of line 35 and add—
<br><blockquote><p>"The exclusion or expulsion of a worker from membership of a specified union or one of a number of specified trade unions under the conditions of subsection (1) above shall not be deemed</p></blockquote></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 442</span>
<p><br><blockquote><p>to be unreasonable if the worker is of a description different from that or those of the majority of the members of that union or does not possess the appropriate qualifications for such membership.".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 22, in page 4, line 32, leave out from "in" to the end of line 35 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"accordance with the requirements of its rules".</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These amendments are directed to that part of the Bill which proposes that an industrial tribunal may require a trade union to act in defiance of its own rules. That is something deeply offensive and absurb which seems to us to impose on the trade unions an obligation or requirement that is never, to the best of my knowledge, imposed on any other professional institution, club or company in the land.<br><br>
Amendment No. 25 is aimed to remove the power that would be given to a tribunal to do what I have just described. Amendment No. 23 is more limited. If the Government are not prepared to accept our arguments on the more general point, perhaps they will be persuaded to accept the more limited case. Amendment No. 22 is a reinforcement of the first amendment.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo), inadvertently or otherwise, was making exactly the same argument, but in his more</span></p>
<p>eloquent and erudite way, last Thursday and, without suggesting that the brevity of my address to the Committee represents the totality of our argument, it might be sensible for me to sit down now and allow my hon. Friend to resume from where he was in full flight on Thursday last.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I gladly take advantage of my right honourable Friend's invitation. I dropped a danger in a previous debate and anticipated improperly the material of the amendment now before us. That was an abuse of the Committee, for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0740">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 443</span>
which I apologise. I should be adding to the abuse if I went over the same ground again, so I do not propose to do that. I can make the point quite shortly.<br><br>
No other organisation would be required statutorily to breach its own rules. I said that if there were—and there is not—a Tower Hamlets Conservative club, and somehow or other I succeeded in getting into membership of the club—perhaps with a false beard and a change of name—and the club committee discovered that this bearded man it thought was Mr. Joe Bloggs, a good Conservative, was in fact Ian Mikardo, a notorious and rabid red revolutionary, it would doubtless say "This chap does not qualify for membership of the club because rule 4(2) says that membership shall be confined to members of the Conservative Party in good standing and therefore he is to be expelled". Nobody would say that that was bad behaviour on the part of the Tower Hamlets Conservative Club.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
If there were—which there is not—a Tower Hamlets association of total abstainers of which one of the conditions of membership was that members should not touch alcohol at any time in any form and in any quantity, and it discovered one day that one of its members had been convicted at Thames police court for being drunk and incapable, it would say "He is in breach of the qualifications for membership" and it would put him out. Nobody would try in a statute to prevent its so doing.<br><br>
Why should trade unions be treated differently from and worse than any other organisations in this regard? One could create some awfully difficult situations in trade unions if one statutorily hallowed a breach of rule. That is what the clause does. It gives blessing to people who break the rules of a union. Is that what the hon. and learned Gentleman wants? Does he want to contribute to that sort of anarchy which could arise in the trade union movement and have great repercussive effects on relations between trade unions and employers, the sort of anarchy which would arise if breach of rules not merely ceased to be disreputable but actually became hallowed? Nearly all trade unions have a qualification for membership.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend has told us that before he came to us he was a toolmaker and was a member of that section—I am not sure which one—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 444</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Section 1.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Section 1 of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers which is open only to persons who have, and who have provided evidence of having, a certain level of engineering skills. My union has rigid qualifications for membership set out in a long and detailed rule.<br><br>
But it can easily happen that a chap applies for membership of a union. The normal procedure is that he applies to a branch and he is nominated and seconded by members of that branch. Some branch committees are more rigid than others in looking at the chap's background and qualifications, and it could be discovered after a while that a member was not entitled to membership because he did not have the qualifications laid down by the qualifications rule. It might well be that he had ducked under that rule in order to avoid membership of a union that he ought to be a member of and was qualified to be a member of.<br><br>
There could be great difficulties if the union expelled that member. I fancy that the hon. and learned Gentleman will say "I would say, and I think that any tribunal would say, that it was reasonable to expel him". I would say that, too. But not all hearings will be bound by the personal view of the hon. and learned Gentleman or my personal view. There is a danger in leaving the thing loose.<br><br>
I should have thought that the intention of the clause and what the Government are seeking to achieve by it would not be materially damaged if lines 32 to 35 after the word "case" were left out. It ought to be open to a union to argue "We acted reasonably because we acted in accordance with our rules; that is to say, we acted as our members want us to act, because if they did not they would presumably seek to change the rules by the methods open to them under the constitution of every trade union". I am not exaggerating when I say that there is a substantial element of danger in those few lines. The hon. and learned Gentleman ought to have a close look at it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have little to add to the persuasive argument advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo). We commiserate with him on his ineligibility for membership of the Bethnal Green total abstinence club.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0741">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 445</span>
I should like the Under-Secretary to deal particularly with the word "requirements" in subsection (5). It does not say
<br><blockquote><p>"only because it has acted in accordance with"</p></blockquote>
its rules, but
<br><blockquote><p>"it has acted in accordance with the requirements of its rules."</p></blockquote>
In other words, we are talking here not about a rule which is discretionary or permissive to the union or its executive but about a rule which is mandatory, a rule which in certain circumstances requires the union to expel or to exclude. This is the most important factor in the whole issue.<br><br>
If the subsection is left unamended, we are placing the union in a position not merely of using discretion in a certain way—in other words, reducing its discretion and compelling it to act in a certain way—but we are also compelling it positively to break its own rules. This is ridiculous. I do not understand how it could work.<br><br>
Am I not right in thinking that there have been a number of cases settled in the courts in the past where individuals have successfully taken action against unions because they have been excluded contrary to the rules of the union? We are now turning that law on its head and saying that no longer can an individual rely on a particular decision being made in accordance with the rules of the union. We are saying, on the contrary, that that is not a reason for a decision arising out of a tribunal. It may well be that precisely the opposite will happen—even a rule which a union is required to observe it will now be required not to observe. That is a point which needs to be clearly put.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once again, we are entering a minefield in which, far from improving industrial relations or improving the strike record of British industry, we are in grave danger of considerably worsening the situation. I suspect that one of the reasons for this is that the Tory Party as usual embarks upon its determination to "do something about the unions" without recognising the facts of industrial life. Over 12 million citizens have joined trade unions, for one reason or another. That is a considerable proportion of the population, and, adding the families and dependants of those members of trade unions who are interested in the work and activities of unions, one is talking about at least half the population.<br><br>
Anyone entering this field who wants to do something useful and beneficial should
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 446</span>
recognise that we are talking about an awful lot of human beings with an awful lot of human failings, and generally speaking—whether one is talking about the working men's club, the local darts club or whatever—there will always be disputes about the rules and what the rules mean, whether someone has acted in accordance with the rules, or whether the individual should be expelled from the club or the organisation. Once one is in that situation, there are invariably heated arguments and strong feelings.<br><br>
I think that we would all accept that wherever groups of people get together there are bound to be blots and blemishes but, looking at the history of the trade unions and the organisation which they have built up, any reasonable man, when he considers the number of people who are members of those trade unions, must recognise that they have created an incredible record of peace and harmony, with, I fully concede, the odd blot or blemish.<br><br>
Anyone looking at the clause and the amendments to subsection (5) will recognise that the words after "case" in line 32 are a potential recipe for disaster. If one recognises that a trade union has built up its rules over many years, with a variety of amendments from time to time as cases and problems arise and the union concerned looks at the difficulties and amends its rules accordingly, one cannot then say:
<br><blockquote><p>"On a complaint under this section".</p></blockquote>
with regard to unreasonable exclusion or expulsion from a trade union the question whether the union
<br><blockquote><p>"had acted reasonably or unreasonably shall be determined in accordance with equity and the substantial merits of the case".</p></blockquote>
that is fine up to that point—
<br><blockquote><p>"and in particular a union shall not be regarded as having acted reasonably only because it has acted in accordance with the requirements of its rules or unreasonably only because it has acted in contravention of them."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that one theme that will run through the Committee—it certainly applied to the Employment Protection Act and the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act—is the rules of the AUEW, my own trade union. In that union we have built up, in layman's terms, an organisation which is equal to or parallel to the English rule of law and justice. For instance, if the executive council decides, for whatever reason, to expel a member from the union, it does not then follow that there is no appeal. In the AUEW, which is also the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0742">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 447</span>
union of my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker), we have, above and beyond the executive council, a final appeal court which is made up of lay members appointed specifically for that purpose. In effect, it is the House of Lords of the AUEW, the final body that one can appeal to in our union.<br><br>
A member who has been disciplined—it need not necessarily be expulsion, because a member can be fined, criticised or admonished in accordance with the union's rules—has the right to appeal to that final appeal court. If the final appeal court, in considering the member's alleged offence and examining the rule book of the union, finds that that individual is not guilty, that is the end of the matter. He is found not guilty and the executive committee is overruled.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend reinforce the point that the final appeal court is bound by the rule book itself to consider every appeal that comes before it strictly in accordance with and in the light of the union's rules? It is not allowed to depart from the rules—the law, as it were—to make decisions on grounds of fact or merit. It must be in accordance with the rule book of the union.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. He has rightly reinforced and spelt out the point that the final appeal committee of the AUEW does not allow its personal opinions to enter into its deliberations on the member's alleged offence. It looks strictly at the union rule book. It looks at what rule the member is charged under and it decides on the basis of the union's rule book. In other words, it acts in direct contravention of what subsection (5) goes on to say. It is purely in those terms that the final appeal court examines the disciplinary action which has been taken against the member.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
In that context, once the decision is arrived at, it is binding on not only the executive council but on every other section of the union. The sentence is either confirmed or dismissed in accordance with the union's rules. We ensure that our rules are brought up to date continuously by a separate body which meets every three years—the rules revision committee—which considers suggested changes to rules submitted by the branches and districts. That committee meets quite separately from the executive
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 448</span>
council. The executive council has no right to change rules: it has the right to put proposed amendments to the rules revision committee, and the rules revision committee is then charged with changing the rules in accordance with the members' wishes and the proposals that have been put to it.<br><br>
The executive council cannot change the rules if it does not like the verdict of the final appeal court on a member who has been disciplined. It has no rights whatsoever in that respect. It has a job to do which has been laid upon it by the members of the union.<br><br>
I submit—this is the thrust of my argument, and I do not want to labour it too long—that it would be far better to encourage unions to bring their rules up to date in accordance with modern standards or the practices of other unions. In fact, in the structure of the trade unions that is invariably what they strive to do.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman is in danger of creating a difficult situation for his Government in the future if this subsection goes through unamended. I assure him and his hon. Friends that they should not think for a moment that an individual who runs into problems with his union is always a highly principled or deeply motivated man. Invariably they will find, if they take the trouble to examine these matters, that the individuals who seek to leave a trade union or to create trouble within a union in the context of clause 3 are in fact men of little principle.<br><br>
I shall cite one example of the sort of thing which can cause problems on the workshop floor. That is where these things will be interpreted—on the workshop floor with the men and women who are shop stewards and convenors faced with this sort of situation almost on a weekly basis. Sometimes one almost needs the wisdom of Solomon to try to solve some of these cases.<br><br>
I had a situation when I was a convenor where the practice in the machine shop was that invariably the machines were designated in accordance with the craft sections of our own union. For instance, in section 1 of our union only men who are skilled and have served five years' apprenticeship at the trade can operate certain machines. Then there is a separate section, the semi-skilled section, section 5A, and in that section they operate less complicated machines. Then there is a third category of machine which requires
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0743">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 449</span>
very little skill and workers in a separate section of the union can operate those machines. It sounds complex but, in fact, it causes very few problems.<br><br>
It sounds complex but, in fact, it causes very few problems.<br><br>
I had a situation where, quite unwittingly and without any malice, one of the chaps, a young chap, who was a labourer in the machine shop, was involved. When one of the machines became vacant, the foreman, doing the chap a good turn, offered him a job on a machine. Of course, the chap was delighted to make that progress from being an unskilled labourer to being an individual with some skills operating a machine. The problem was that, once the man started on the machine, it was discovered that he was not a member of the AUEW but was a member of the Transport and General Workers Union. One could quickly see the potential problems which were about to be created in that sector.<br><br>
I do not want to go right through this because it would take quite a long time to explain the many problems over the 48 hours which at one stage threatened a strike of the entire machine shop. Suffice it to say that the two convenors, myself and the Transport and General Workers' Union convenor, managed to sort it out amicably with a bit of friendly persuasion from our district officers. The Transport and General Workers' Union allowed the individual to leave that union and join the AUEW.<br><br>
Under the Bill as drafted on the question of unreasonable exclusion or expulsion from trade unions, one can easily see that in such situations as that we could have a nasty inter-union dispute on our hands.<br><br>
The more the Government try to draw the rules as tightly as possible, the greater they are in danger of placing a noose round their own necks which will hang them, as they found to their cost in their industrial relations legislation. The hon. and learned Gentlemen should think again about subsection (5) and recognise that most trade unions draw up their rules for sound reasons—sound historical reasons—after many years of considering industrial practice, considering the relations they have with other unions within the same plant and within the same works. The hon. and learned Gentlemen should recognise that our amendment is beneficial and helpful and they would be well advised to accept it.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 450</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I welcome you back to good health and back to the Chair, Mr. Goodhew. I am sorry to add that I fear that I may be incubating a somewhat similar malady to the one from which you suffered, and one consequence is that I am losing my voice, though I am certain that the latter circumstance will be borne by hon. Members on the Government side with their customary equanimity and fortitude.<br><br>
But, while my voice lasts, let me say that I am completely opposed to the whole Government approach on this matter. I exclude two hon. Gentlemen who opined in <i>The Times</i> yesterday and seemed to be talking considerable sense, but I fear that the Conservatives have among their number in high places—perhaps it would be invidious to point out the high offices they hold—some who take a more rigid, doctrinaire and inflexible attitude and who adhere to quack economic and monetarist theories which promise, I think it was called, three years of austerity. We all know what we are talking about, and in these circumstances the workers tend to look to their trade unions for protection.<br><br>
The results of that are now apparent around the country. Certain people in the Conservative Party—I have already excluded some—say that it is all quite simple. We just pass some laws and that will deal with the problem. That is far too simple. The effect would be to undermine the trade unions. That is basically what they want to do—to weaken the power and strength of trade unions. I put it to hon. Members on the Government side that that is dangerous and it could well lead to their undoing, as it has on previous occasions. They ought to be seeking the co-operation and understanding of trade unions rather than alienating and antagonising, as they are, many of our fellow-citizens.<br><br>
We now see ordinary British people, like ourselves, who have never been engaged in any trade union activity of this description, taking part in such activity. It seems to me—I offer this as advice to the Conservative Party—that it is elevating what one of my colleagues calls "punk monetarism" above the traditional political skills that we normally associate with the Conservative Party. Those political skills seem to have deserted them.<br><br>
We know that in this country there is no right to strike. What we have are immunities from actions which otherwise would be illegal. These immunities were originally

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 451</span>
given by people such as Disraeli, and there was the tradition followed by Sir Walter Monckton, RAB Butler and Harold Macmillan. But what we have now is what I would call an infantile perversion of Marxism, to elevate economics above politics in this way.<br><br>
I shall read the words of Sir Winston Churchill as quoted in <i>The Times</i> last week, on 15th February:
<br><blockquote><p>"Trade union organisation is very important, and the more moderate its officials are, the less representative it is; but it is the only organisation with which the Government can deal. The curse of trade unionism is that there is not enough of it, and it is not highly enough developed."</p></blockquote>
I urge the Conservatives in their own interest—why should I give them advice?—to go back to their previous skills and philosophies. All I would say is that to bring out our fellow-citizens who have never taken actions of this sort is a remarkable achievement within nine months of the present Government's life.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Needham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could tell the Committee the date of those words by Sir Winston Churchill. I have a feeling that it was probably in about 1911, when Mr. Churchill was Minister of Labour in a Liberal administration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is true that Sir Winston was a national leader and not a party hack. He tended to move from the Liberals to the Tories. I should not like to say in what particular dispensation that was, but certainly the Tory Party after the war was proud to have his name at its head. This article was printed on 15th February, and the hon. Member may like to refresh his memory.<br><br>
We have heard a lot in the press about something called the Militant Tendency in the Labour Party, which has tried to make workers militant. They have not been very successful, but certain colleagues of hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite have within nine months achieved far more in making peaceful British workers militant than has the Militant Tendency.<br><br>
I return now to the point about union rules dealt with so eloquently by my hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Evans). I joined my trade union 33 years ago, and during that whole period I have worked in closed shops. I have never worked in anything but a closed shop. I have never felt in any way intimidated by
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 452</span>
that fact, or that my liberties were curtailed. I felt the opposite. I felt that my employers were powerful people and that if I had a personal argument with their lordships—most of them were Lords, or very rich men—I should come off worse. But because we had 100 per cent. trade unionism I felt more secure.<br><br>
I did not feel intimidated, and the 100 per cent. trade unionism was accepted as natural and the norm. It had existed for centuries, which must make it a rather conservative institution—British and conservative with a small "c". It originated from the guilds. I believe that the 1971 Act made the closed shops in my industry void, but I can tell hon. Members that it never had the slightest effect in our industry. I cannot think of one instance where it made our closed shops, our centuries-old, 100-per-cent. trade union arrangements, in any way different. I do not know whether anyone here can point to such an effect now.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
More and more groups of workers will have the same aspiration. They are emulating the learned and chartered professions. I believe that the legal profession is a closed shop. I would not go as far as Arnold Bennett, who said 65 years ago of the legal and medical professions that
<br><blockquote><p>"their two great unions are among the most vicious opponents of social progress in Britain today".</p></blockquote>
I do not go that far, but I have always thought the legal profession basically a closed shop. <i>The Times,</i> on 5th January 1980, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The professions have emerged from the 1970s with their considerable privileges and monopolies largely unscathed. The Royal Commission on Legal Services recommended a strengthening of the near-monopoly of conveyancing enjoyed by solicitors."</p></blockquote>
It then went on to say what the Government had given to the doctors. I shall not read it all, but it included the statement that
<br><blockquote><p>"There is an obvious attraction too in the self-regulation of means of entry."</p></blockquote>
If it is right for the legal profession and the other learned and chartered professions to have self-regulation of the means of entry and the like, why it is wrong for workers to have the same? No doubt, all hon. Members have been bombarded, as I have, with material from employers and others. If groups of workers and groups of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0745">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 453</span>
employers wish to come to voluntary arrangements, why should they not be allowed to do so? For example, I have a paper here from the General Council of British Shipping, and no doubt other hon. Members have had the same document. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"However, as far as the closed shop is concerned, GCBS would wish to maintain its existing agreements with the unions without alteration."</p></blockquote>
That is what is wanted there.<br><br>
We are talking of trade union rules. Let me explain what happened when I joined my trade union 33 years ago. That is a long time ago, but it was an important affair when we were initiated into our union and I can remember it now, which shows how important it was to us. We were proud to join. One could not just wander up and join but had to have a proposer and seconder, and had to give an explanation to the chairman of why one wanted to join. The chairman read a little homily and lecture in which he gave one a rule book and explained its importance. He urged one to live one's life according to that rule book, jealously to guard one's reputation in the union, and to abide by the rules. He virtually said, "Regard that book as your bible, and if you go by that you will not go wrong". It protects everybody.<br><br>
There was an occasion when I did something unorthodox. Some trade union officials proceeded against me under the rules and purported to apply a penalty against me. I was able to look at the rules and bring to their attention that they had broken their own rules. Immediately they lifted the penalties against me. So it is a protection for the members against the officials. It is a protection for everybody.<br><br>
An interesting thought occurs to me. Under clause 1, did we not provide that there would be Government funds for ballots to amend the rules? If members of our union wish to change the rules, they can do so. They can move resolutions through their chapels and branches. If the executive council wants to change a rule, it has to come to the members for a ballot vote. We can then apply to the certification officer and the Government will give us taxpayers' money to ballot the members on changing the rule. Having democratically agreed, with taxpayers' money, to change the rule and having a new rule, if the union broke the rule app-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 454</span>
arently a member could go to an industrial tribunal and get it overturned. That must be nonsense.<br><br>
I contacted counsel on this point to ask him what he thought. He has written to me today saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"A provision which allows an industrial tribunal to override a trade union's rule book is a recipe for internal chaos... There are serious difficulties in practice in forcing a member upon a trade union branch whom the branch is unwilling to accept."</p></blockquote>
Regardless of the second part, I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman to give his thought to the first part, because I think that that is important. It is wrong to proceed against a union for carrying out its own rules. To do so would undermine the authority of trade union leaders.<br><br>
In our industry the unions maintain workshop discipline. The management are very pleased that we do so because it means that they do not have to. Let me give examples. A member could be negligent in his work. Every time there is an edition change on a newspaper, a new set of cylindrical plates is brought round to be clamped on the cylinder with the new copy. A negligent member could put the wrong plate on the cylinder. After that is done, before the machine runs on at speed someone should check the folios. Again, he could be negligent.<br><br>
It has not been unknown for a paper to go out with, say, two pages 10 and no page 9. Imagine a customer of a well-known paper getting two pages 2 and on page 3. He might well feel aggrieved. It has happened. We would have that member before the chapel committee, he would have to answer for his conduct and he would be given a punishment. Normally, it would be something like placing him for a period of time on a more menial job, taking away his seniority. Possibly he would be losing money and doing a more menial job.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Such as taking pictures for page 3.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It could be—but something degrading and menial, something to which he would object violently. If he objects, we are very democratic. He could appeal against the chapel committee to the full chapel. If he lost the case there, he could appeal to the branch committee. If he lost the case there, he could appeal to the executive committee
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0746">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 455</span>
and the governing council. There is a series of appeal procedures through which he could go.<br><br>
Another case we have, regrettably, is where there could be disagreements that could lead to violence. People have actually swapped punches. We cannot have that with a great deal of running machinery. That case would be brought before us. Under our rules, the member can be fined, expelled or otherwise dealt with.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mark Wolfson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a little lost and would value some clarification from the hon. Member on where he sees union responsibility and management responsibility. As I understood it, the two examples that the hon. Gentleman has given are being taken up in this situation by his union, but where does he draw the line and say that perhaps this should be a management responsibility and that, if the management does not fulfil it properly, that is its problem rather than his own?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Member has raised that point. This is the dilemma. Under our present rules, in a self-regulating arrangement, a voluntary arrangement with management, we operate these procedures with the agreement and to the satisfaction of management. This comes precisely to the hon. Gentleman's point. Are we no longer to be allowed to do that under our rules and maintain workshop discipline?<br><br>
We say to the employer "There shall be 100 per cent. trade unionism. If we offer you labour at good rates of pay, you are entitled to have qualified labour doing the job properly. We will see that our people do the job properly. We will discipline them." If we find that a member has a grievance against the union because we do that, and he goes to a tribunal and we are overturned, our reaction will be to wash our hands of the whole thing. We shall say that no longer will this be our duty, but it will be the function and prerogative of management; from then on, keeping discipline will be the management's job and not ours.<br><br>
Our role then changes round. When the management wants to discipline someone, we go along to protect the member. That is the answer to the hon. Gentleman's question. Instead of the member accepting his punishment, we go along and say to the employer "We think that you have been far too severe with this member. We are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 456</span>
very sorry. We do not agree. We shall take industrial action to protect him." Therefore, it will be a cause of industrial dispute.<br><br>
At the moment, because it is voluntary and self-regulating and the employer is happy to see us keeping discipline, things go very well. But if we no longer have the protection of our own rules, we shall say to the management "You have an additional burden. Every time you discipline one of our members we shall come along to protect him." The employers do not want that, but it is what would happen.<br><br>
Let me give two more examples, one from my own industry and one from another. I read in last week's newspapers that Bill Sirs of the steel union gave what he called an instruction to his members. This was when the safety men, in desperation, said that they would come out and not maintain safety in the blast furnaces. Only men driven to desperation would think of saying or doing a thing like that. Had they done so, millions or perhaps hundreds of millions of tons of capacity would have been destroyed.<br><br>
So under the union's constitution the general secretary is entitled to issue an instruction to his members, "You will not do that. You will do something else." If the members say that they will not do that—it is the same in our union—the executive can issue an instruction and the member must obey it. But if he does not, and if the union cannot then take disciplinary action against its members, where shall we be?<br><br>
I am certain that everyone applauded Bill Sirs in carrying out the union's rules and giving an instruction to those members.<br><br>
My last example is from my own union. We had a case where <i>The Times</i> newspaper was moved from one set of printing machines to another set. Because of the arrangements there, these machines were not cleaned properly. After each run of a publication, the machines are supposed to be cleaned so that the new people who come along work on fairly clean machines. This was not being done, so the chapel had a grievance and started to take certain action.<br><br>
The thing dragged on and on, and actions increased and escalated. The national officials came in and gave the chapel an instruction to work normally. For the first time that I can remember in the history of my union, the chapel demurred, because it was so upset. It said, "We are not accepting the instruction." That would have caused a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0747">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 457</span>
crisis on <i>The Times</i> before the famous crisis.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
Here was a trial of strength on an interpretation of the rules between the executive and the chapel. The executive expelled the entire chapel and took its members' cards away. That is the ultimate deterrent—to fine, expel or otherwise deal with. It then said that all members could be readmitted to the union if they came before the union executive in groups of two or three and agreed to abide by the authority of the rule book and the executive council.<br><br>
That they all did, and the union executive gained the plaudits of the press and of the employers because it was delivering an agreement which it had made with the employers. But it is very serious to expel someone, to take his card away and say, "If you behave in that way you will no longer work in that industry."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They were trade union bully-boys.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. They were trade union bully-boys. But the comment in the press was to give plaudits to the general secretary of my union for being tough. I must say to the hon. and learned Gentleman that to undermine the authority of the union leaders in carrying out the rules is very dangerous.<br><br>
Another printing employer is known in this country—D. C. Thomsons. It is one of the biggest printers in Scotland. There there are no trade unions at all. The hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) nods in agreement. I believe that it is true—the hon. Gentleman will nod again if it is—that in order to work there one has to sign a piece of paper that one will not join a trade union. That is the situation in one of the biggest printing firms in the United Kingdom.<br><br>
The Bill gives no redress to a worker who cannot get a job because he is a trade unionist. That is an anomaly. If an employer refuses to engage someone because of his union membership there is no redress. But a non-unionist is given a right of action against the union if he thinks that it has acted unfairly. The fact that a unionist is given no rights against a reactionary employer is an anomaly, and I should like to learn what the hon. and learned Gentleman has to say on that.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 458</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) on making a speech of such length when he is failing in health. We look forward to his restoration to health with something not far short of awe.<br><br>
It might be for the Committee's convenience to remind it of the effect of these amendments. Then I shall deal immediately with what I recognise to be the genuine anxieties to which the subsection gives rise. I fully understand what has led right hon. and hon. Gentlemen to take the objections that they have taken. But I believe that those apprehensions are founded upon misunderstanding.<br><br>
The effect of the amendments, taken together, is to remove the declaratory statement in Subsection (5) that "the question of whether a trade union had acted reasonably or unreasonably" in excluding or expelling an individual shall not depend upon whether the union did or did not act in accordance with its rules. The question for the tribunal is whether the expulsion was unreasonable. Then is added, for explanation, that that question shall not depend upon whether the union acted in accordance with its rules or not.<br><br>
The amendments remove that. That is their purpose. The first one that we have been dealing with, amendment No. 25, does not add anything in its place. But amendment No. 22 would have the effect, by contrast, that the question would be decided on whether, in addition to considerations of equity and the substantial merits of the case, the union had acted in accordance with the requirements of its rules. In other words, that completely reverses the explanatory part included in subsection (5).<br><br>
Amendment No. 23 would have the effect that a union's action would not be deemed unreasonable if the excluded or expelled individual was different from the majority of the members of the union or did not possess the appropriate qualification for membership.<br><br>
The Government advised that these amendments should be resisted because subsection (5) is mainly declaratory. It has the purpose of making clear that the reasonableness of a union's action in expelling or excluding is to be decided in accordance with equity and the substantial merits of the case. That is a criterion or test with which the tribunals are already familiar. Secondly, it makes clear that, in particular, the reasonableness
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0748">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 459</span>
of a union's action shall not be decided only on whether the action was in accordance with its rules.<br><br>
The second part is for clarification, because it follows from the first. If the test is expressed to be whether the exclusion or expulsion was reasonable, a tribunal ought to know that compliance with the rules is not decisive of that question. But it is clear that some difficulty or uncertainty might arise in the minds of the tribunal's members. Therefore, it is thought wise—the Government have accepted this advice—to state explicitly in the subsection this provision in order to remove any doubt that what the clause establishes is a new substantive right for individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Giles Radice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. and learned Gentleman say whether any problems have arisen in the way that he is describing might happen? Has he any cases in mind, or is this a hypothetical danger which the Government are trying to cater for?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not a. hypothetical danger. I think I am able to cite some rather good authority for this which would be regarded as persuasive by right hon. and hon. Gentlemen. It gives me an opportunity of referring to the work of the IRC, which the hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans), or perhaps his hon. Friend, referred to on the last amendment.<br><br>
Of course, the IRC does work which is very valuable, and we hope that it will continue. The annex to the report of the General Council of the TUC to the 1978 congress, which deals with the work of the independent review committee, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"But it is certainly not true, as has been inaccurately reported, that the Committee's main criterion is whether the union has followed its rule book, rather than whether its action was reasonable in the circumstances. Once satisfied on the preliminary question that the rules have been observed, the Committee always goes on to inquire into the merits and reasonableness of the case presented both by the union and the complainant. Were it not to do so the Committee would be in dereliction of its duty. Anyone with personal experience of cases heard by the Committee knows that this is the case. The Committee wishes the General Council, Congress and the public to be reassured on this critical point, in view of the misrepresentations of its work that have appeared."</p></blockquote>
That provides, from a source that the hon. Gentleman would regard as impeccable, the answer to his question, that cases do arise where the question whether or not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 460</span>
in justice somebody should be expelled from his union, or excluded from a union, does not depend upon whether the rules of the union have been followed. This is a truly important point, because I reiterate what has been said by hon. and right hon. Gentlemen on the Opposition side of the Committee about the experience that that committee brings to its work and the value of the work that it does.<br><br>
The same point was probably in the mind of the right hon. the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Foot) when he was Secretary of State in 1974 when the first Trade Union and Labour Relations Act was passing through the House. He said on 30th July in column 503:
<br><blockquote><p>"the sensible test for expulsion is whether it is fair and reasonable by ordinary commonsense standards."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 30 July 1974; vol. 878, c. 503].</p></blockquote>
He did not say that the test for expulsion that is fair and proper is whether the rules of the union have been unfair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. and learned Gentleman will accept that if we take subsection (5) and delete all the words after "case" in line 32 we are meeting his point, because it would then read:
<br><blockquote><p>"On a complaint under this section, the question whether a trade union had acted reasonably or unreasonably shall be determined in accordance with equity".</p></blockquote>
Surely, that is the point. That is the whole thrust of the argument that we have been presenting to the hon. and learned Gentleman this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the argument but I have already said why it is thought necessary—and the Government have accepted the technical advice that they have received—to go on to say that, notwithstanding that a union has complied with its own rule book, that shall not decide the issue of whether it has been reasonable. It is thought to be necessary to express that in a plain and explicit way.<br><br>
Amendment No. 25 simply deletes the passage which is complained of, but one of the other amendments, No. 22, reverses it and says that it shall be "in accordance", and that, of course, if a very important point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. and learned Gentleman would now address himself particularly to the other half of the words whose exclusion from the clause he is resisting—namely,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0749">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 461</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"unreasonable only because it has acted in contravention of them."</p></blockquote>
At this stage he is only taking the case where a union has acted in accordance with its rules but may, in his view, still be acting unreasonably. Can we now look at the case where a union has quite positively broken its own rules in excluding or expelling a certain individual and the Government are saying that that is not a good reason why that individual should be re-admitted?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will deal with that straightaway. The important point to remember about this clause is that it reflects the wish of the Government and the belief of very large numbers of trade union members that there ought to be a right, enforceable by compensation, in the case of somebody who has been unreasonably expelled from his union. This is the concept—unreasonable expulsion or unreasonable exclusion.<br><br>
I do not wish to weary the Committee by referring once more to how familiar this concept of unreasonableness is to the industrial tribunal. It is quite separate from the point raised by the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther), who asked about the cases where an expulsion is today by the common law held to be unlawful because the rules have not been complied with. That is a quite different criterion, and will I try to explain it in simple terms.<br><br>
If somebody complains that he has been expelled from his union, to which he belongs as a matter of contract, he is entitled to complain that that is not a valid expulsion because the union has not followed its own rules, and a court will agree with him if he makes out that case, because a union can only do to one of its members—a member tied to it by contract—that which its own rules, which form part of the contract, permit it to do. Therefore, if it fires him in breach of its own rules, it has broken its contract. But the criterion is: what does the contract between the union and its members provide for? However, we are not talking here about giving somebody a remedy for breach of contract. We are talking here about giving somebody a remedy for something quite outside the contract that he has with his union; namely, unreasonable expulsion. This is a new concept.<br><br>
I believe that hon. Members on the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 462</span>
Opposition side of the Committee who have objected to the provisions of the clause are really objecting to that new concept. I understand why they should, but they cannot expect us to agree with it. If I were to object to the concept of unreasonable expulsion or exclusion, I would seek to place my whole faith in the rule book. But because I am in favour of the concept of giving a new remedy for unreasonable expulsion, I cannot place my whole faith in the rule book.<br><br>
I would like to give an illustration of the type of rule that could be found—I do not say it often would, but it could be found—which, if it were to be decisive of the issue of whether expulsion is reasonable or not, would lead to injustice. We could have a set of rules which made no provision for an expelled member to put his case against expulsion to anybody, or we could have a rule which required a member to obey all the instructions of the executive, however reasonable or unreasonable, however lawful or unlawful, those instructions were.<br><br>
If he were expelled I doubt whether he would regard himself as having been justly dealt with if he were told that the issue as to whether he has been reasonably or unreasonably expelled has to be decided by reference to the rule book and the rule book is very strictly drawn and he has had it. It is that kind of situation that could arise that leads the Government to accept the advice that they have had that we ought to put explicitly into this subsection the passage which is opposed in these amendments. I hope I make that clear.<br><br>
We are saying that the test is reasonableness. Of course, amongst other things, the tribunal will look at the rules; it will look at the question of the rules, and at all other relevant questions and qualifications that come into it. The hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) began his speech this morning by saying that the question of qualifications goes to the root of an ability of a union to choose who it shall and who it shall not have. The hon. Member for Newham, North-East, with his long experience of the craft guild and the current union of printing industries, says that they have been doing this for centuries.<br><br>
Of course, that is right, and, of course, any tribunal looking at the question of whether an expulsion was unreasonable will look at the grounds for expulsion, and if those grounds were based upon the man
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0750">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 463</span>
not having the proper qualifications, that would, of course, be regarded as a very relevant matter. The code of practice will give guidance as to the importance of qualifications in this context of reasonableness. What we are saying here is that since the central criterion is that of reasonableness—reasonableness to be judged by the equity of the matter and the substantial merits of the matter—it cannot be right also to judge it by whether the rules have been complied with or not.<br><br>
To say a further word about qualifications to those who have said that surely it is right for unions to take account of a man's qualifications in deciding whether to keep him in or to expel him, or whether to admit him or not to admit him, of course that is right. I would expect in every case a tribunal to take that very seriously into account when applying the criterion, which the statute says it has to and the clause says it has to. But to those who say "Why should a union's rules be overridden? Why should a union, amongst all the voluntary organisations, a club or whatever, be singled out to have its rules overridden and to be told, for example, 'Although your rules say that you can expel somebody in these circumstances, in this instance I am afraid you cannot, and if you insist on it you must pay him compensation'?", I would draw attention to this fact that this provision applies only in the context of the closed shop.<br><br>
What is the significance of that? The significance is that if the hon. Member for Newham, North-East wishes to ply his trade in the printing industry, to all intents and purposes he has to be a member of the appropriate union, for reasons which he has explained to us. In a closed shop industry, if one loses one's union card one loses the right to ply the only trade that one may know. The hon. Gentleman would be all right; he can come to Parliament; but not everybody can do that. That is why the closed shop context justifies the singling out of a trade union, among other voluntary organisations, for the" overriding, if one likes, of its rules in these circumstances. What we are dealing with here are the circumstances in which we think it just and permissible for somebody to have his whole trade taken away from him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that we are getting nearer the nub of the matter when prejudice is coming to the surface of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 464</span>
argument rather than historical fact. The hon. and learned Gentleman spent half his period of reply raising hypothetical cases which may or may not happen. May I cite another hypothetical question? May I pose the case—which could well happen—of the union which, in accordance with clause 1, ballots its members on taking industrial action and having a strike? The members vote in favour of taking industrial action. However, one of the members in the closed shop decides not to follow that course of action and remains at work. Eventually the strike is settled. When the men return to work the member who blacked is expelled from the union for breaking the union's rules and not acting in accordance with the wishes of the majority. Would the Minister suggest that in that case the tribunal would find for or against the individual who had been expelled?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The tribunal will take all the circumstances into account.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure it will.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case the hon. Gentleman should be thoroughly reassured, because if he were not sure that it would take all the circumstances into account he would have grounds for serious anxiety. Amongst other things, of course, it looks at the rules It looks at them, but it should not be governed by them. There is more than a presentational reason for having the passage at the end of subsection (5) which is objected to in the amendments. The common law right usually depends upon showing a breach of rules. I have dealt with that already. It is, therefore, likely that the unions will argue by analogy that acting in accordance with rules is also a defence in relation to this new right not to be expelled unreasonably. Therefore, there is a need for the second limb of subsection (5). Its inclusion is not merely presentational.<br><br>
I do not want to weary the Committee further. It might have been helpful had I been able to put this explanation a little earlier. If hon. Gentlemen object to the concept of the right not to be unreasonably expelled, I can understand that they would wish to substitute for it the criterion of whether the rule book has been complied with. On the other hand, they must recognise that the Government attach great importance to this new right. If they do attach that importance to this new right

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 465</span>
and wish to see it on the statute book, I suggest that they must recognise that to govern that right by reference to a rule book, which may contain rules that are completely inequitable—I gave two illustrations of possible rules—would be to defeat the intention of the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman explain something to me? I cannot think of many people expelled from closed shops, although I have no doubt there have been a number which we could refer to. I can refer to only one, and I will do it briefly. I wonder whether the Minister thinks that as a result of this there will be a whole number of additional cases. In the one case that I have in mind, a member had persistently misbehaved himself. He had been warned about his future conduct. He had been barred from this and that office. He had been fined by the union, and so on. At the end of the day the union said "You really are beyond the pale; it is too much; you are expelled from the union." It meant exactly as the Minister said: he could no longer ply his trade.<br><br>
A journalist on a very well-known South London newspaper heard about this, thought it was the atrocity that has been described, and wrote a really stinging editorial on how atrocious it was that my union had denied this man his livelihood by expelling him. This was brought to the attention of the general secretary of the union, so the general secretary picked up the telephone and telephoned the manager of the newspaper and said "I have just read your editorial. If you will give this man a job I will give him his card back". Immediately the manager slunk under his chair because that man had so often, disgraced himself in the newspaper's office. He said "I will certainly never employ him". The general secretary said "I did not think you would". The manager called in the young cub reporter and gave him a dressing down and told him that one of the jobs of a reporter is to get the facts first and find out the nature of the individual. We heard no more about that. The man was a recidivist with a long history. That is why a union would expel him. There are not many such cases. Can the Minister instance many cases, or does he think that as a result of the new clauses we shall get many more cases where expulsions would be overturned?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 466</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the hon. Gentleman's restoration to health after a momentary relapse. I think not, and I hope not, because nobody wishes to see expulsions taking place. Certainly nobody wishes to see conflict within trade unions. Of course there are unarguable cases; there are unsustainable cases; but there are also, under the existing state of the law, cases where expulsion can take place in very unjust circumstances. This is the nub of it, I believe; that there are many instances of union members working in closed shops who object to instructions that may, for example, lead them to breach their own conscientious code or ethical code or to take actions which they believe fundamentally to be wrong but which they are constrained to do because of the fear of expulsion, which they believe would be unreasonable expulsion in those circumstances but in the face of which they would have no redress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Such as going on strike.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me give an illustration. This is a serious issue and one which certainly arouses anxiety. Supposing I am an ambulance driver, and a very loyal member of my union, and my union comes into dispute with the employer, and it says, "From now on, everybody shall stay in the ambulance station." I am perfectly content with that, and they say, "In no circumstances will you take your ambulance out." I abide by that, until the day comes when the infants' school down the road, say, catches fire, and I say, "I am not going to obey this instruction any more. I could not live with myself if I did", and I take my ambulance out.<br><br>
I take an extreme case to illustrate the argument. Thereafter I am branched, and all the rules are complied with. There is no breach of natural justice, no breach of the procedures contained in the rule book, but I am branched, and ultimately I am deprived of my union card. All the procedures are correctly followed. Under the existing law there are circumstances of that character which, if they led to expulsion, would lead any reasonable man to say that it was an unreasonable expulsion, but there would be no redress. It is in the fear of those circumstances that many people, I believe, suffer injustice today, and it is partly to meet that type of situation that we believe it right to confer
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0752">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 467</span>
this new right of redress for unreasonable expulsion.</span></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. and learned Gentleman help me, because I should like him to reply to a specific point? Before I put that, however, may I say that he has run a wild and implausible hypothesis if he thought that that was a good basis on which to introduce such a provision as this. He ought to have given us not a hypothetical case from the stratosphere of his mind, but some real examples. Perhaps he can tell us where this hypothetical ambulance man really was, and whether there has been a case remotely approaching that rather wild case he mentioned.<br><br>
More germane to the whole issue before us is that the hon. and learned Gentleman was arguing that there are union rules which impose unreasonable obligations on members, and it is those unreasonable obligations with which he is concerned, and which he is empowering the tribunal to put aside. I assume that it is the case that if the tribunal did require a union to set aside a requirement of its rules, it would subsequently be open to another member or members to go to the High Court because the union was acting in breach of its rules. What happens in that situation where we have a clear conflict, if not contradiction, between the trade union instructions on the one hand of the industrial tribunal and the possible decision of the High Court on the other. Will he explain that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A union faced with a claim for compensation for unreasonable expulsion, under the provisions of the subsection, would not be able to say, "You must regard this as being decided by whether or not the union has complied with its rules". That is what we are concerned with here. As to the circumstances that would follow, the consequence would be that the tribunal would say, "You have complied with your rules, and have sacked this man. You must pay him compensation". That is the jurisdiction we are discussing on the clause.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman asks what if a union, understanding this to be the law, is then sued by one of its members for not complying with its own rule book. I find it difficult to visualise what the course of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 468</span>
action would be. Nor do I find it one in the least likely to arise. I do not see how it could arise. In this circumstance, the overriding requirement is that there shall be a provision for redress and compensation if one is unreasonably expelled in a closed shop situation with the consequence that one is unable thereafter to earn one's living. That is the overriding need in the view of the Government.<br><br>
I am asked for examples, and I refer once again—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: From real life.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No doubt the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow will concede that the Independent Review Committee deals with cases from real life. If it does not, his whole case—a proper case—in support of the jurisdiction of the IRC falls. Of course it deals with cases from real life. [<i>Interruption</i>] I will deal with one question at a time, if I may, because I have listened to long and interesting speeches, and am trying to deal sensibly with the points. That is why it is important that the independent review committee says that
<br><blockquote><p>"it certainly is not true…that the Committee's main criterion".</p></blockquote>
—main criterion, even—
<br><blockquote><p>"is whether the union has followed its rule book, rather than whether its action was reasonable in the circumstances. Once satisfied on the preliminary question that the rules have been observed, the Committee always goes on to inquire into the merits and reasonableness of the case presented both by the union and the complainant."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman suggested that the possibilities about which I questioned him were so unlikely that he could not envisage any kind of situation arising that would give that. If I may bore him for a minute or two, I shall give him such an example. It has been touched upon twice in the earlier debates. It is the difficulties that could well arise from the rule book of my union, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) referred earlier. He touched on, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo), the thorny question of the qualifications for admission into the particular section of the union—different membership groups are in different sections according to their qualifications—and the difficulties of obtaining admission into the unions in section 1.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0753">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 469</span>
If I may correct my hon. Friend the Member for Newton, he has not got the position quite right. First, he rightly referred to the need to show that the applicant for membership of section 1 had served the requisite number of years in one of the appropriate skilled or less skilled trades of the union. There are also now qualifications about the state of one's health. One has to have two eyes, two hands, two legs, and that kind of thing. But it also lays down that applicants for admission to section 1 must be between the ages of 19 and 40.<br><br>
In our earlier discussions I have said that in particular establishments the skilled craftsmen insisted very often that they would work only with members of section 1—the green card holders of the union. My hon. Friend referred to section 5—the red card.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman turns away with a cynical air. But I must tell him that these are real experiences that I have had, in which someone who has served honourably and properly at the trade with all the appropriate qualifications until, say, the age of 35 perhaps gains entry to the House of Commons as a Member of Parliament and, on the assumption that the electors will keep him here for life, lapses his membership of the union. At a subsequent general election he finds that his electors have turned sour, and he wants to return to his former trade. But he is now over the age of 40. There are vacancies in which he could be employed and people are willing to welcome him back with open arms. He seeks admission into the union and is told, "We are sorry. You cannot go into section 1. You are too old. You are 41. We know that you have served your time. You are fit and healthy, a damned good toolmaker and all the rest of it, but you are now 41. Sorry, you cannot go into section 1." He says, "But the chaps down the road will not have me with any card other than a section 1 card."<br><br>
Presumably the hon. and learned Gentleman will say, "That is just the kind of situation for which I am legislating here. Surely it is unreasonable for that man to be denied that union card and thus denied employment. That is the kind of case that I shall empower the tribunal to listen to and, if need be, to say that that is an unreasonable requirement of the rule and set it aside."
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 470</span>
I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will agree that that might seem a reasonable kind of situation in which the tribunal should exercise the discretion that he will give it. Does the hon. and learned Gentleman wish to—?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to have a chance to reply before lunch.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not finished putting my case. If the hon. and learned Gentleman will allow me to finish the case that I am making—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had thought, contrary to all past experience, that the hon. Gentleman was running out of breath.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. and learned Gentleman was going to correct my reasoning up to that point. Apparently not. I assume that this is one of the situations he has in mind, a very real possibility and one that I have encountered, and that in those circumstances he would think it reasonable for the tribunal to exercise that discretion.<br><br>
Let me tell the hon. and learned Gentleman that if the union accepted that it had to accept a recommendation from the tribunal that it had applied an unreasonable rule or applied the rule unreasonably and, therefore, it was required to comply with the recommendation of the tribunal, there would, I am absolutely convinced, be a demand from members or perhaps officers of the union that the courts be required to give a ruling about the observance of the rule which puts an upper limit on the age of entry.<br><br>
It is for this reason. The upper age limit is set not in order to deny a person the right to exercise the craft that he possesses but because that membership section of the union carries with it a superannuation benefit. It is on an actuarial basis and the benefit in proportion to the contribution is determined on the assumption that the age of 40 is a reasonable cut-off point.<br><br>
If the hon. and learned Gentleman says that the whole thing is grossly discriminatory against the craftsman who wants to exercise his crafts and against whom there is no reasonable objection other than the fact that he is 41 years of age, the union would reply that the important thing is the designation that is on the union card and not the colour of it. The problem arises not from the union and its rule book but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0754">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 471</span>
from the behaviour of the individuals in the particular establishment, and no tinkering around with the rules will alter that. It is a real problem that has to be faced, but it will not be done by a tribunal setting aside the requirements of the rules.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has, I am sure, somewhere in there asked a question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. and learned Gentleman does not follow me and wishes me to make it clear, I am only too happy to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not put the right hon. Gentleman to further exertion on that point. Let me say this. The type of situation which the right hon. Gentleman posits is exactly the sort of situation that ought to be able to be decided by an impartial and experienced tribunal. He always puts these types of illustration from the viewpoint of the trade unions, and I wish the Committee to consider equally the viewpoint of those who work in a closed shop. The issue is never put by right hon. and hon. Gentlemen on the Opposition side of the Committee from their viewpoint. I am not asking that it should be looked at exclusively from their viewpoint, but I do ask that it be looked at equally from their viewpoint.<br><br>
I start, therefore, from the proposition that if a person works in a closed shop, he has, by definition, to hold a union card, and if he loses his union card he suffers grave and sometimes irreparable damage. All that we are asking is that there shall be a safeguard against that happening to him unreasonably.<br><br>
Right hon. and hon. Members on the Opposition side of the Committee are steeped in their experience, in many cases as convenors and as officials, in the case of the right hon. Gentleman, of trade unions; I understand their bias in favour of the trade unions and their looking at this difficult issue with that bias, I understand it, and I do not criticise them for it. I only ask that they do not require Parliament to demonstrate the same bias. That is what we are on about here.<br><br>
To go back to the point that was asked by the right hon. Gentleman as to what would happen if the union were sued by one of its members for not giving effect to its rule, I think that the answer is probably—and I answer it off the top of my head—that it has got to decide. If the rule book
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 472</span>
is drawn in such a way that the union needs, and indeed requires, to sack and expel its members in circumstances that an impartial tribunal would say were unreasonable having regard to the equity and the merits of the case, either they have to put up with that or change their rules. I would not have thought it was a very desirable situation to maintain a rule book whose enforcement leads to an independent and impartial tribunal, experienced in these matters, saying that the action is unreasonable.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
To go back to the point that the hon. Member for Newton raised, again he produced a hypothetical situation, as we all are asked to do, and they are valuable. The key to it seemed to me, on reflection, that the strike had been preceded by a ballot of the work force and that there was not a substantial majority in favour of that strike. If, in those circumstances, the member did not come out on strike, and that was in breach of union rule, I would expect that a tribunal would, in those circumstances, be strongly inclined—I do not put it any higher than that—to find that the operation of the rule book led to a reasonable expulsion. These are matters which all turn upon their facts and one cannot have a fairer—[<i>Interruption.</i>] I hope the right hon. Gentleman is not going to suffer the same <i>grippe</i> that has come over like a miasma from behind him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. and learned Gentleman that I am all right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is all right. He can still stand up. All these circumstances depend upon what is reasonable, and there can be no fairer concept than what is reasonable to be judged by the equity and the merits of the case.<br><br>
I have been asked for an individual instance. I remember now, although I had forgotten until I was reminded from behind, of the case of Mr. Joe Thompson, a member of the National Union of Dyers, Bleachers and Textile Workers, who was dismissed in November 1978 from his job as a dyer's operative with a textile firm following expulsion from the union. He was expelled after the discovery that he had worked a few months for a blacked firm 13 years earlier. He had had various jobs since outside the union's sphere of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0755">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 473</span>
interest. He complained to the TUC independent review committee, which heard his case in four sessions from February to May 1979. The committee found the expulsion invalid, being a breach of the union's own rules. It recommended reinstatement, and it advised the union to help him find a job in some other section of the textile industry, and he was reinstated in another section of the union, and he eventually found a new job in a textile mill.<br><br>
The point about it is that he there got a remedy. If he had not had a remedy, perhaps because the rule book had not been complied with, because there was not this factor of the rules being broken by the union—if he had not had a remedy from the IRC, or it was an incomplete remedy because there was no question of damages or anything like that, he would have had no remedy at all. It is that type of case that will be filled by this clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several Hon. Members</span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been asked time and again—I am very interested by all these noises and I want to hear them all—for a concrete illustration, and I remember the case of this man. That is a case where the independent review committee did a valuable job. But it is an illustration of the circumstances in which a man may be unreasonably expelled from his union and have no redress at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has been putting the case for something which he claims is necessary, and we are pressing him—I hope he does not think that we are doing so unduly—to be precise and to give us examples.<br><br>
The first hypothetical example the hon. and learned Gentleman gave us was about the mythical ambulance man. It is absurd to imagine that British unions would officially do that. We can rule that out. That was a nonsense.<br><br>
We then asked if the hon. and learned Gentleman could think of any other case, and, with his vast experience of this legislation for many years, he could not think of one until he was prompted by one of his officials and he thought of one case which was rectified outside these new provisions—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Radice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And was, in any case, in breach of union rules.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 474</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: and was in breach of union rules. Therefore, the hon. and learned Gentleman's case argues against him here. Unless he can come forward with something more substantial than that, this great bogy of the closed shop harming people will be completely unconvincing. The only thing that we could think of is that it will deal with strikes where trade unions genuinely call strikes, and then members can just ignore them. The hon. and learned Gentleman hedged away from that, but I ask him to agree that he has never put so unconvincing a case as he has so far.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman really must permit me to conclude this argument. I will do it in this way. I have, first of all, put forward the type of case to which the clause will or may apply. That is a hypothetical way of approaching the argument and a valuable way because it highlights the essence of the argument. If I am pressed for practical illustrations I will remind the Committee of a similar clause in the 1974 Trade Union and Labour Relations Act. Section 5 gave a right to a worker not to be excluded from membership and not to be expelled from membership of a trade union.<br><br>
The criterion there was whether it was arbitrary or unreasonable:
<br><blockquote><p>"The exclusion or expulsion of a worker from membership …shall not be deemed to be arbitrary or un reasonable if the worker is of a description".</p></blockquote>
But the criterion was if the expulsion was arbitrary or reasonable. That is not the criterion that we are adopting, but there were, during the currency of that legislation, 33 cases arising under it. Of those, 16 cases were ultimately withdrawn and seven succeeded, and of those seven I understand that four were cases in which the applicant worked in a closed shop. So this is not a hypothetical or a fanciful situation. That legislation, which was not on the statute book, I think, for very much longer than 18 months—it may have been two years—produced those cases, and they were cases in which the tribunal did not find evidently too much difficulty in applying that criterion.<br><br>
I have taken too long, I dare say, but largely in an effort to meet the points made by hon. and right hon. Gentlemen on the Opposition side of the Committee. I. conclude by saying that if we do not believe that there is any need to safeguard
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0756">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 475</span>
the interests of somebody who is unreasonably deprived of his union card in a closed shop, we shall see no virtue in this clause. But if, on the other hand, we believe that those safeguards are needed, to say that the question at issue shall be determined by whether the rule book of the union has been complied with, however unreasonable those rules may be, will be to defeat the purpose of the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to take up too much of the time of the Committee by going in to bat for a short second innings before other hon. Members have batted even once, and, indeed, so far as hon. Members on the Government side of the Committee are concerned, before they have even thought of getting a pair of pads in case they want to bat one day.<br><br>
I am induced by the speech of the hon. and learned Gentleman to rise again because it seems to me that his speech contained a number of misconceptions. The first misconception arose when he said he was sorry that he could not get in earlier to give the explanation, because that seems to assume that his explanation was so convincing that if he had been able to get in earlier that would have ended all further debate. I am bound to say that I think his speech is totally convincing in relation to one of the three amendments which we are considering together, and that is my own amendment No. 22.<br><br>
I think that the case the hon and learned Gentleman put up against that, reinforced by quotations which he made from an annex to the report of the Trades Union Congress and from observations of my right hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Foot), was an absolutely concrete case and enough to satisfy me—I hope my hon. Friends will agree with me—that I ought not to press amendment No. 22. I think he made out a complete case for saying that the question whether an expulsion is reasonable should rest entirely on union rules. He made out a case for saying that it is manifestly clear it should not rest entirely on union rules, and that disposes of amendment No. 22.<br><br>
But I do not think that anything the hon. and learned Gentleman said disposes of amendment No. 25. He kept on arguing that there should be a protection. All right—that would still be there if amendment No. 25 were carried. He kept on arguing that the hearing should confine itself to considering whether the expulsion was
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 476</span>
reasonable. All right—that would still be there if amendment No. 25 were carried.<br><br>
But what the hon and learned Gentleman has done now is to argue precisely the opposite case from the one which he argued when we were considering the previous group of amendments. What he then said was that if one mentions a particular part of the case, somebody in future will say "Why did Parliament include that and exclude something else?" and assume, therefore, that Parliament intended that the something else should be excluded. Why does that not apply in this case? If amendment No. 25 were carried there would still be the generality that the complaint should be decided according to whether a trade union had acted reasonably or unreasonably and it should be determined:
<br><blockquote><p>"in accordance with equity and the substantial merits of the case".</p></blockquote>
All right. We are all happy about that. Nobody would want it to be determined in accordance with inequity.<br><br>
Now the hon. and learned Gentleman wants to add one particular consideration; namely, whether the rules have been breached. If we do, somebody in a tribunal in the future may well say "Why did Parliament not also say 'in accordance with whether the man has behaved well or badly in relation to his union; in accordance to whether he has behaved well or badly in relation to his workmates'?" Why does the argument which the hon. and learned Gentleman used so clearly and so specifically in dealing with the previous group of amendments not apply in this case? Why does he really want this form of exclusion?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a perfectly fair question, and the answer to it is that where there is, in law, a conceivable doubt whether, for example, the application of rules or the compliance with rules may affect the question which the tribunal has to determine, it is for the convenience of tribunals and for the greater certainty of the legislation that that should be disposed of by an explicit provision. That is the reason.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not see why a tribunal tribunal might be worried by a reasonable doubt on this subject and not be worried by reasonable doubts on other subjects.
