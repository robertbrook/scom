	<div class='ul'>
	<li>"(1) Subject to the remaining provisions of this section any member of a company may in a representational capacity for himself and all other members of the company petition for or on behalf of the company to enforce any rights, duties or obligations owed by the company which could be enforced by the company itself or to obtain changes for any breach thereof.</li>
	<li>(2) No such petition shall be filed without leave of the court which may be obtained on application to a judge of the High Court.</li>
	<li>(3) Such petitioner must establish to the satisfaction of the court that he is acting in good faith and prima facie in the interests of the company in filing such petition.</li>
	<li>(4) If in the case of any company—
	<ol>
	<li>the Secretary of State has received a report under section 168 of the 1948 Act (inspectors' reports) or exercised his powers under Part of the 1967 Act or section 36(2) or (6) of the Insurance Companies Act 1974 (inspection of company's books and papers); and</li>
	<li>it appears to him that any ground exists by virtue of which a member could apply to the court under subsection (1) above,</li>
</ol>
he may himself (in addition to or instead of presenting a petition for the winding up of the company under section 35(1) of the 1967 Act) apply to the court by petition for an order under this section.</li>
	<li>(5) the court may if it thinks fit:</li>
	<ol>
	<li>make such order for security for costs as it thinks fit;</li>
	<li>make an interim order for costs in favour of such petitioner who shall be accountable to the company therefor in the event that the action is dismissed with costs;</li>
	<li>order costs to be payable to such petitioner as between a solicitor and his own client;</li>
</ol>
	<li>(6) Any petition filed by such petitioner shall not be discontinued, compromised or settled without the approval of the court.</li>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that at the same time we are discussing following amendments and new clauses:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>Government amendment No. 238, in page 57, line 24, leave out from 'that' to end of line 26 and insert
	<br><q><p>"the affairs of the company are being conducted in a manner which is unfairly prejudicial to the interests of some part of the members or that any actual or proposed act or omission of the company (including an act or omission on its behalf) is or would be so prejudicial.".</p></q></p>

	<p>New clause 16—	<i>Powers of the courts with regard to companies.</i></p>
	<p>New clause 17—	<i>Proceedings against those guilty of misconduct.</i></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Moreover, if there is a gleam of a case that in some direct or indirect way the company might be said to be interested, the court must allow the filing of the petition. I have now finished my sentence criticising subsection (3) of amendment No. 221, which I believe to be defective. I mentioned subsection (7) also in my remarks on Tuesday. I consider the precise meaning of the phrase 'well founded "in that subsection to be difficult to define. I shall be grateful if my hon. Friend will illuminate us on that because it occurs in the Bill as well as in amendment No. 221.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I couple that comment with my disagreement with the suggestion made by the Law Society that the court should have power to order a company to give information. A court could exercise this power only if it knew what information was being required. It is either that case, in which event the court would have to know what information was required, or the suggestion must be that the court can require the giving of any information at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that to be in the interests of either a petitioner or the running of a company. Indeed, it is not how courts proceed. They are able and prepared to proceed even if a petitioner outlines a case without evidence, on the basis that the petitioner is unable to procure evidence. It is during the proceedings of the court, through discovery, as I hope the right hon. and learned Member for Warley, West (Mr. Archer) will agree, that the necessary
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0168">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>301</span>
information and documents can be produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the mischief with which clause 47 is designed to deal? It is that section 210 in its present form is not a strong remedy. As one who was responsible for one of the leading cases—	<i>in re</i> Five Minute Car Wash Company—which was an unsuccessful application, I know to my cost that a continuing course of conduct has to be proved, and, although that has been limited by the cases, I have always agreed with the recommendation of the Jenkins committee that "unfairly prejudicial" is the right basis for a case. The people we are trying to help are not all the shareholders or, in the wording of amendment No. 221, "any member of a company", but a minority of members who are being unfairly treated. That is the mischief that we should be trying to put right. That is why I support the clause as drafted and not the Opposition's proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Reginald Eyre)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the rignt hon. and learned Member for Warley, West (Mr. Archer) introduced these amendments, he made clear that they were based on a recent article in the 	<i>Law Society Gazette,</i> which referred to the recommendations of the Ontario select committee on company law. The right hon. and learned Gentleman may be reassured to learn that the Government had already decoded the cryptic reference to the Ontario select committee which was made by the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr Davis) during his opening remarks at our first sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, however, a deeper mystery. The article referred to, and the amendments before us, do not deal with the relevant legislation which was enacted in the Ontario Business Corporations Act 1970. Section 99 of that Act differs in a number of material respects from the recommendations of the Ontario select committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are not here concerned with events in Ontario, interesting though they may be. We must deal with the amendments before us, complete with a printer's error which, as I am sure the right hon. and learned Gentleman will agree, renders amendment No. 221 at one point absurd. I assume, of course, that the Opposition intend the new subsection (1) to apply to the enforcement of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>302</span>
	<br><q><p>"rights, duties or obligations owed"</p></q>
to the company, not "by the company", as printed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I am obliged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments raise important and serious issues which deserve to be examined in detail. The starting point for considering them must, however, be the purpose of clause 47 as it appears in the Bill. As the right hon. and learned Member for Warley, West correctly said, this was based on the recommendations of the Jenkins committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Jenkins report gave considerable attention to the problems of minority shareholders. Paragraph 212 of the report sets out the following recommendations:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the need to demonstrate that the facts would justify the winding up of the company should no longer be a condition of intervention by the court;
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, section 210 of the Companies Act should be amended so as to extend it to cover
	<br><q><p>"cases where the affairs of the company are being conducted in a manner unfairly prejudicial to the interests of some part of the members and not merely in an 'oppressive' manner".</p></q>
Thirdly, section 210 should be amended
	<br><q><p>"to make clear that it covers isolated acts as well as a course of conduct".</p></q>
Fourth, that
	<br><q><p>"provision should be made enabling the court to restrain the commission or continuance of any act which would suffice to support a petition under section 210".</p></q>
Fifthly, the court should have
	<br><q><p>"an express power, where it thinks fit, to authorise the bringing of proceedings in the name of the company against a third party on such terms as the court may direct".</p></q>
This would enable the court to deal with cases in which the company itself has been wronged and the action which damages the interests of the minority shareholders is the company's failure to take action against the wrongdoer for example, if a director has misappropriated the company's funds and the other directors, who are also the majority shareholders, fail to take action to recover the money;
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sixth, that legal personal representatives and others—for example, trustees in bankruptcy—to whom shares are transmitted by process of law should be
	<br><q><p>"entitled to present a petition …under that section".</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>303</span>
Clause 47 as it appears in the Bill implements all those recommendations. The clause was taken direct from the Bill introduced in 1978 by the previous Administration, and was inserted into the present Bill in another place by the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now, at this very late stage, the Opposition apparently want to change course. The amendments which they have put down—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We took the view that this was a matter of considerable importance. In view of the considerations referred to in the 	<i>Law Society Gazette,</i> we believed that the matter required more ventilation than had been the case in the Committee on the previous Bill and justified further reflection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am bound to admit that although I believed at the time that the original clause in our Bill, to which I had obviously given a lot of attention, was satisfactory, my right hon. and learned Friend and I felt that we should test the Government on this. We do not have the back-up that the Minister has. The only way to do that was therefore to table these amendments and new clauses. Suffice it to say that I think that there is considerable merit in what we say. We hope, therefore, that the Government will not make a final judgment about the matter at this stage, but will give further thought to the proposals that we have made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand and appreciate what the hon. Gentleman has just said. However, I ask him carefully to consider this. The Opposition amendments are not concerned particularly with the rights of minority shareholders but are intended to confer on shareholders generally the ability to take action on behalf of the company, thereby overturning the long-established general rule, based on the case of Foss v. Harbottle, that the company alone can sue for a wrong done to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are not able to accept the Opposition amendments to clause 47 for two principal reasons. First, we are not persuaded that the rule in Foss v. Harbottle should be set aside to the extent implied in the amendments. Secondly, and more important we do not accept the reduction in the protection afforded to the minority shareholders—which, after all, is our main purpose in the clause—which adoption of the amendments would entail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>304</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall go on to explain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reduction in minority protection comes about because, as the Jenkins report clearly recognised, there are two separate categories of situation in which minority interests need to be protected. One is where there are direct wrongs to the interests of a minority, for example, where controlling directors abuse their powers to the detriment of minority shareholders not represented on the board. This type of situation tends to occur in private companies with a relatively small number of shareholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second occurs where there is a wrong done to the company itself and the control vested in the directors or the majority shareholders is used to prevent action being taken. It is only in this latter type of case that the rule in Foss v. Harbottle causes difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments that we are discussing are aimed solely at the second type of case identified by the Jenkins committee. The key provision in amendment No. 221 is the proposed new subsection (3), which would require a petitioner to establish to the satisfaction of the court that he is acting in good faith and prima facie in the interests of the company—I stress the phrase "of the company"—in filing a petition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a provision could not help at all in cases where the interests of minority shareholders are being prejudiced by the conduct of the majority. Indeed, in some respects the Opposition amendments would put minority shareholders back to the unsatisfactory situation which existed prior to the passing of section 210 of the Companies Act 1948.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I feel that it will help the Committee if we indicate some of our difficulties as we go along. Is his argument that if instead of seeking to amend the clause we had tabled a new clause, so that both provisions lay side by side, that proposal would have been preferable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) explained the circumstances in which the Opposition put down the amendments and asked for them to be considered in principle. After all, they break fresh ground to a consider-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>305</span>
able extent. I am trying to explain, in quite strong terms, why that approach is not appropriate and why it has limiting consequences for the main reforms intended in the provisions of clause 47.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Committee will not accept the defects in the amendments that I have briefly tried to describe, and I doubt that the Opposition really intended to advocate what, as I have explained, could be a retrograde step not in the interests of the minority shareholders whose position we are seeking to improve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main object of the amendments is to provide for the setting aside of the rule in Foss v. Harbottle. It is worth remembering that this rule is based on the fundamental principle of our law that the company is distinct from its members, that the business of the company shall be managed by its directors, and that the directors are answerable to the company, not to each individual member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also practical benefits which derive from that general rule, namely, that it prevents a multiplicity of suits by individual shareholders, and, more important, that where the proposed action concerns a matter which can be ratified by the general meeting, it is futile to embark on litigation about it except with the consent of the general meeting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general rule in Foss v. Harbottle has, however, been set aside by the courts in strictly limited circumstances, mainly relating to cases involving fraud. There has been criticism that these exceptions are too narrow, and one of the provisions of clause 47, namely, subsection (4), deals with such criticisms by giving the court the power, where it thinks fit, to authorise the bringing of proceedings in the name of the company against a third party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition amendments go very much wider than the provisions of Clause 47(4) (	<i>c</i>) in the Bill as printed. They would enable an action to be taken by a shareholder not merely when the conduct complained of was "unfairly prejudicial" to some of the members but in any case where he could convince the court that he was acting in good faith and in the interests of the company. This makes it much more likely that such an action could be brought to challenge the judgment of the directors of a company, who also were acting in good faith.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>306</span>
The strong criticism of the amendments, developed in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Baker), strengthened our reluctance to bring in a provision which could be used to question the judgment of directors, in substitution for the provision in the clause which would enable an action to be brought only when the directors were considered to be acting in a manner which was unfairly prejudicial to the minority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also rather surprised to see, in the proposed new subsection (7) in amendment No. 221, that the powers of the court to make such order as it thinks fit are left at large, rather than being confined to the remedy which the company would have obtained had it taken the action itself, as in clause 47(4) (	<i>c</i>) of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, if we set on one side the unsatisfactory way in which the main amendment deals with the rights of minority shareholders—this is a serious point which I hope the Opposition will consider, quite apart from the defects in drafting, which are understandable—what we are discussing is a far-reaching amendment which would also introduce two radical new procedures into our law which would need careful consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concept of a representative action embodied in the amendments is an unfamiliar one in our law. So also is the idea that a court must give prior sanction to the bringing of an action. These are not matters which it is proper to decide on at short notice, even in such a distinguished and knowledgeable Committee as this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Flattery will get the Minister nowhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Gentleman might be heavily affected by that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such matters need to be given full and wide consideration before being introduced into legislation. I feel sure that, on reflection, the right hon. and learned Member for Warley, West and the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) will recognise that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Stevens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of short notice, I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State recognises that all those public bodies and organisations which, collectively and severally, have been giving us advice on the Bill, and which will not have had an opportunity to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0171">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>307</span>
consider the new clauses until 48 hours ago, will have an opportunity before the Bill comes to the House and be listened to if they make representations to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point with which I entirely agree. We try very hard to ensure that all the factors that he mentioned are properly taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I have discussed this matter informally with the Minister, I think it ought to be on the record that I echo the view just expressed by his hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Stevens), because, with all the good will in the world, the Committee will not be able to do justice to the vast number of amendments and new clauses with which we are faced. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take that into account when seeking to organise the Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to assure the hon. Gentleman that I shall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn briefly now to new clause 17. It reproduces almost exactly the wording of section 333 of the Companies Act 1948, but section 333 applies only where a company is in liquidation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are aware that there are arguments for extending both section 333, and the related section 332, to situations other than those involving liquidation, and we are sympathetic to the need for changes in these provisions. We do not, however, believe that such changes should be linked with actions by disaffected shareholders, as proposed in this new clause. I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will accept this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government propose to review the operation of both section 332 and section 333 of the 1948 Act in the light of the work of the Cork committee, which is at present carrying out a comprehensive review of insolvency law. The report of the Cork committee is expected towards the end of 1980, and it is hoped to incorporate some at least of its recommendations relating to company law in the 1980–81 Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all the reasons which I have given, namely, that the amendments do not deal satisfactorily with the problems of minority shareholders, that they would expose honest directors to the risk of litigation, and that they would introduce radical new procedures into our law without
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>308</span>
proper consideration, the Government cannot accept the Opposition amendments. Clause 47, as drafted, should go a long way to ensure that minority shareholders get a better deal, without permitting shareholders to challenge the decisions of directors in a wide variety of circumstances. I therefore recommend the Committee to reject the amendments.

I come now to new clause 16, which the right hon. and learned Member for Warley, West specifically referred to when moving amendment No. 221. I understand that it is based on a recommendation by the Law Society. It could be considered quite separately from the Opposition amendments on clause 47 but, naturally, I shall deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main purpose of clause 47, as I have explained, is to remove many of the legal obstacles to a successful action by a minority shareholder whose interests have been unfairly prejudiced. We are particularly concerned to provide a means of redress where there is a clear and obvious detriment to minority shareholders. We do not, however, want to encourage shareholders to be enabled to go on fishing expeditions with court backing to discover whether or not their interests may have been prejudiced. I was interested in the remarks in this connection of my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North, which came from practical experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a danger that provision of the kind envisaged in new clause 16 would open up another route by which disaffected shareholders could harass directors by persuading the court that there might be information held by the company which would, if they knew about it, enable them to take action. There is a difficult balance to be struck between, on the one hand, the need to give minority shareholders an effective right of redress where their interests have been unfairly prejudiced and, on the other, the undesirability of opening up the affairs of companies to detailed scrutiny by shareholders who are merely disgruntled and persistent complainers. I believe that clause 47, as drafted, gets the balance about right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must give credit to the Jenkins committee, and to the hon. Member for Hackney, Central, who was the Minister responsible for preparing the 1978 Bill from which clause 47 has been taken. I should prefer clause 47, which was widely welcomed when introduced, to be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>309</span>
tested in the courts before we decide whether steps are necessary to protect the interests of minority shareholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer now to Government amendment No. 238. This is necessary to correct a small defect in the drafting of subsection (2) of clause 47. As the subsection is at present drafted, the Secretary of State would no longer be able to petition in relation to oversea companies which could be wound up here, whereas this is now possible under section 35(2) of the 1967 Act and section 210 of the 1948 Act, which clause 47 replaces. The amendment corrects this, and I hope that the Committee will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is certainly no dispute between the two sides of the Committee that we should not rush into amendment of what are clearly most complicated and delicate matters. There is always a problem when moving amendments in Committee. We are always confronted at fairly short notice with ideas that are being tossed around. I echo entirely the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that we all ought to have further opportunity to reflect on these matters, and, I hope, to consult on them, and it might be sensible to return to them on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all learning as we go along. I confess that I had not heard of the Ontario Business Corporations Act 1970. We learn something new every day, and I shall now go away and see whether there is a copy of it in the library.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not wholly sure that I follow the Minister's argument that, because we already have clause 47, it would be sensible to see what the courts make of it before we amend it. It is not as though it is already on the statute book. We are discussing two alternative ways of arranging the statute book, and there is no greater argument for waiting to see what the courts make of the present draft than for waiting to see what they make of an alternative draft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that clause 47 originates from the Bill presented by the Labour Government. But both my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, Central and the present Secretary of State have said on separate occasions that they wonder whether clause 47 goes far enough. I should have thought, therefore, that it was common ground that it was worth exploring whether the clause goes far enough. That was the purpose of the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. and learned Gentleman explain what mischief in clause 47 the remedies under discussion are designed to put right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that, but it might make more sense if I were to answer it at this stage so that members of the Committee may be clear in their minds. I think that I dealt with the point at our last sitting—the reference is col. 289 of 	<i>Hansard.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present clause would impose upon a petitioner the burden of proving conduct that is "unfairly prejudicial". I indicated at our last sitting that that might give rise to two problems. First, the words "unfairly prejudicial" will become a term of art. We do not yet know how widely or narrowly the courts will construe them. To frame a section of a statute in a form which requires some question of fact to be proved affirmatively restricts to some extent the powers of the court to give relief. Instead of requiring that something should be established in that way, ourproposal would leave the matter to the discretion of the court without its having to be satisfied on any matter of fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the mischief as we saw it. We proposed to deal with it by giving the court a discretion instead of compelling it first to arrive at a finding of fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other problem that we saw in the present draft of clause 47 arises out of the same necessity for establishing as a fact that there has been conduct which is unfairly prejudicial. At present, so often the directors have all the relevant information and the unhappy shareholder does not. That was the point of new clause 16, among other things. It is one of the difficulties with the present clause 47.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I also say that we are grateful to the Minister for pointing out the printer's error in amendment No. 221. The word should indeed be "to" and not "by".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's difficulty about amendment No 221 seems to be that it would restrict the existing clause. I appreciate that argument, although I should not wish to assent to it without further consideration. But that argument would disappear if we decided to put our proposals forward as a new clause rather than as an amendment to the existing clause. Our provisions would then be side by side with the existing clause. Clearly, that would entail some revision in the drafting,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0173">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>311</span>
but if the Committee thought that, in principle, that would be a sensible way to proceed, it would remove the Government's objection as put forward by the Under-Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But should we want the wording of the existing clause, of amendment No. 221 and of new clause 17, all side by side? Clearly we should not. Some revision in the drafting would be required. We shall have to look at how many of the provisions would be desirable and how many would duplicate others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue in principle was succinctly put by the Under-Secretary. He asked whether shareholders should be able to challenge decisions taken by the directors, when directors are appointed for the precise purpose of taking decisions. I accept that there is a problem here. But the whole 	<i>raison</i> of clause 47 is that one cannot leave these matters entirely to the directors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To the hon. Gentleman's question about whether the shareholders should be able to challenge decisions taken by the directors, my answer would be "Yes, if the court thinks that that is appropriate." I do not know how far apart on principle that leaves us, but I suspect that it does not leave us all that far apart. That, I think, is the matter of principle on which we have to reflect between now and Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's other criticism, I think, was that our wording gave the court powers which were too wide, because it gave the court a very wide discretion as to how it would deal with a problem once it was satisfied that the problem existed. I was a little puzzled, because I thought that that was what the existing clause 47 did and that it was a very sensible thing for it to do. That seemed to me to be a point in its favour. Subsection (3) provides that—
	<br><q><p>"If the court is satisfied that a petition under this section is well founded it may make such order as it thinks fit for giving relief".</p></q>
Admittedly, subsection (4) then sets out some of the powers which may be exercised but expressly says that that is not intended to be prejudicial to the very wide wording of subsection (3). It is therefore not clear to me why that should be a criticism of our proposals, which seem to me totally to accord with the Government's proposals in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was again a little puzzled by the hon. Gentleman's comments on new clause 17.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>312</span>
He seemed to be saying that he understood that the new clause was based on section 333 of the 1948 Act, but that that section applied to insolvency, whereas the new clause proposed to extend the remedy to a situation which had nothing to do with insolvency. He is, of course, quite right. He has completely apprehended the purpose of the new clause. He went on to argue, however, that the Government would therefore wish to look again at section 333 but that as the Cork committee is currently considering the law of insolvency they would not wish to amend the section until the Cork committee had made its recommendations. I understand that, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, as the hon. Gentleman said, the whole purpose of our new clause is to extend this remedy and this approach to situations which have nothing to do with the law of insolvency. I therefore fail to see how that can depend in any way on the recommendations of the Cork committee with regard to insolvency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to new clause 16. I appreciate the danger that the words
	<br><q><p>"The Court shall have power to order a company … … to give information"</p></q>
might tempt people to embark upon fishing expeditions. All of us who have practised in this matter know the kind of arguments that are used from time to time when applications are brought. But I am not sure that I share the view of the hon. Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Baker)—even if I fully apprehended it—that there is a problem in that until the court knows what the information is, it does not know whether to order its disclosure. One can formulate a request for information without knowing what the answer will be. The courts order discovery every day of the week. What is there in new clause 16 which goes any further than what the courts normally do on applications for discovery?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying—and I think that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will agree—that a court will listen favourably to a petitioner's application on the basis of a prime facie case without its being supported by any evidence. Provided that on the face of it there is a case, the court will say that there is a case to be heard and that in the course of hearing that case it will order the relevant information to be produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause, however, seeks in effect
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0174">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>313</span>
to give any petitioner the right to go to the court and say "I am a shareholder. You, the court, give me any information I ask for. Then I will decide whether I can establish a case and whether I wish to do so." I can see that there is an argument for that. But I believe that it would open a Pandora's box which would cripple the running of any company. That was the point that I was trying to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for elaborating the problem that was in his mind. But he knows as well as I do that High Court judges are not naive. They do not lend themselves to any frivolous application, or to any type of fishing expedition, just because somebody asks them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our new clause proposes to give power to the court to consider whether it was a proper application to make, whether reasonable need had been established for the making of it and whether the information required is relevant in dealing with the problem. If the court is satisfied on all those matters and thinks that it is proper in all the circumstances, having heard all the arguments against, it may grant the application. That does not seem to me to open up a Pandora's box.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not see where the amendment gives the court even those bounds in its draft or application. In subsection (3) it simply says that the court has to answer the petitioner if
	<br><q><p>"he is acting in good faith and prima facie in the interest of the company".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about two different provisions. I thought that he was referring to new clause 16, which concerns the application to the court to order a company to give information. If he is speaking about amendment No. 221, we have gove over that argument before. The point is that if a petitioner can establish that there are good reasons for bringing an action on behalf of a company, we say that the matter should then be totally within the control of the court. I thought that the argument was about new clause 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore it does not seem to me that any Pandora's box will suddenly be opened. All we are saying is that an application for discovery can be made before other proceedings are launched, precisely because the shareholders are not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>314</span>
in possession of the information which would enable them to launch those other proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, we can have lengthy arguments about such matters, and so far the Committee has avoided that. Speaking for my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, Central and myself, I simply say that we wish to consider the matter further. We want to consult the various bodies that are advising us. It may be that we can, even have some discussions with the Government between now and Report. Perhaps we should all reflect further and do some more reading on the subject and consider the matter at length. We have been given references this morning that were not available to us previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend, who is an experienced tactician—or perhaps who has a nasty suspicious mind—has pointed out to me that, before we ask leave formally to withdraw the amendment, he would like the Under-Secretary confirm that that course meets with his approval.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was rather distressed when I heard the right hon. and learned Gentleman's description of his Friend's state of mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinto Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not that I do not trust the Under-Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having listened carefully to all that the right hon. and learned Gentleman said, I believe that he appreciates that there is a great deal in the arguments that I developed in detail. I do not wish to repeat them and exhaust the Committee unnecessarily. We must all think carefully about the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the right hon. and learned Gentleman came to the Committee in a fresh and eager state of mind, wishing to embark on further aspects of company reform. However, I submit that clause 47, as prepared by the hon. Member for Hackney, Central—I am glad to pay tribute to him for that work—takes us well along the road. We should be grateful for that, because there are enormously complicated and wide-ranging implications in all the other matters that we have discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, we are prepared to discuss those matters further and we shall consider the points put by hon. Members opposite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 196 adds a new subsection to clause 48, which seeks to amend section 108 of the Companies Act 1948, which requires the publication in various ways of the name of the company. If the Committee will bear with me, I shall quote part of section 108 of the Act to illustrate how the clause and amendments would amend it. It provides that every company
	<br><q><p>"(	<i>a</i>) shall paint or affix, and keep painted or affixed, its name on the outside of every office or place in which its business is carried on, in a conspicuous position, in letters easily legible".</p></q>
It is to that paragraph that amendment No. 196 refers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 108 of the Act continues.
	<br><q><p>"(	<i>b</i>) shall have its name engraven in legible characters on its seal".</p></q>
I may come back to that in connection with one of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It continues:
	<br><q><p>"(	<i>c</i>) shall have its name mentioned in legible characters in all business letters of the company and in all notices and other official publications of the company, and in all bills of exchange, promissory notes, endorsements, cheques and orders for money or goods purporting to be signed by or on behalf of the company, and in all bills of parcels, invoices. receipts or letters of credit of the company".</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0176">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>317</span>
I read that in full because it is a comprehensive provision for the responsibility to be placed on companies to show their name on all business papers and documents. All that is quite apart from the requirements of paragraph (	<i>a</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a penalty clause in section 108 which perhaps I ought to have amended in my amendments. If amendment No. 196 is accepted, that would need some amending but perhaps it can come later, if necessary. There is quite a severe penalty for not having the name of the company affixed or painted outside a business. If a person who was enthusiastic about the collection of fines chose to take prosecutions against every company which had not affixed or painted its name outside its place of business, I imagine it would be a matter of a few million pounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This part of section 108 of the 1948 Act is far more honoured in the breach than in the observance. But the one place where it is honoured is by the banks. Members of the Committee will have received a communication from the Committee of London Clearing Bankers pointing out that 11,000 offices or branches in England and Wales display brass or—more commonly now—stainless steel plates which show the name of the bank—that is, the full name including the word "Limited" or the abbreviation "Ltd".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When those banks become public companies, or continue to be public companies, under this legislation they will be obliged to add to their names either "public limited company", in full, or the abbrebiation "PLC". The banks inform us that a replacement plate costs £160, and if one multiplies that by the number of new plates that will need to be cast, an expense of £1,760,000 must be met. That is merely for the banks. But one can envisage the position if repeated throughout those companies which will become public companies, and with shops, commercial premises, and so on. The expense of complying with section 108(1)(	<i>a</i>) of the 1948 Act will be enormous and to no useful purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is anyone likely to be decived by the fact that Lloyds Bank Limited still has "Lloyds Bank Limited" outside every branch and does not put up outside "Lloyds Bank Limited PLC"? Will anyone be deceived into thinking that Lloyds Bank, the National Westminster Bank, or Barclays Bank are private limited
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>318</span>
companies? Incidentally, if a bank did put "PLC" after its name, that is equally likely to confuse as it could also stand for "private limited company"—but perhaps we shall come to that on a later clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has any estimate been made by the companies concerned of what it would cost to make the change in situ and not to have completely new plates?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As for the clearing bank, they have merely quoted the figure for new plates. They evidently consider that it would be inadequate to scratch "PLC" on the existing plates. Some of us are good at graffiti of that sort—perhaps I shall get myself engaged by the clearing banks to do it for them. However, the banks do not consider that such an alteration would be elegant. Nevertheless, even that alteration would be rather expensive if it is to be clear. It must be in a conspicuous position in letters easily legible, according to the 1948 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, paragraph (	<i>a</i>) is broken so many times in law that we could do away with it altogether. We would still have paragraph (	<i>c</i>), which obliges a company to make its name perfectly clear on all formal and informal documents, and on any papers which come before those whom it deals. Those are the objects which will tell the public whether the company is a public limited company. I suggest that we could rely on section 108(1)(	<i>c</i>) of the 1948 Act and dispose of paragraph (	<i>a</i>). Amendment No. 196 does that. It would also be achieved to some extent by my amendment (b) to Government amendment No. 76.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of amendment No. 196 adds the provision that
	<br><q><p>"it shall not be an offence to exhibit outside the office or place in which a company's business is carried on the name of that company before re-registration under section 8 of this Act if it was an old public company."</p></q>
If one removes paragraph (	<i>a</i>) and says it is no longer necessary to exhibit one's name outside a place of business, one has to go on to say that it will be no offence if another name is exhibited provided that the other name is that of the company before re-registration. The principle is already accepted in subsection (3) of the clause and,indeed, in my hon. Friend's amendment No. 75.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the amendments to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0177">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>319</span>
Government amendments Nos. 75 and 76.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 75 relates to an offence committed by the company—
	<br><q><p>"in circumstances in which the fact that it is a public company is likely to be material to any person".</p></q>
and so on. It is the words "likely to be" to which I object—dealt with in amendment (a)—and to those in the following phrase of amendment No. 75
	<br><q><p>"it uses a name which is likely to give the impression that it is a private company."</p></q>
That I deal with in amendment (b), which substitutes for "is likely to" the words "may reasonably".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, my hon. Friend's amendment would read—
	<br><q><p>"in circumstances in which the fact that it is a public company is material to any person, it uses a name which may reasonably give the impression that it is a private company".</p></q>
The word "likely" is used in subsection (2) of clause 48. I believe this to be an unfortunate word, difficult to construe, and it is difficult to understand what is intended by this provision. It would be far better for those who have to obey it to know clearly, it must be shown to be one way or the other, that material not likely to be material; and not is likely to give an impression but may reasonably give that impression.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps that may be a matter of drafting but, on the other hand, I think that difficulties may arise if prosecutions result and we leave in the word "likely."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to Government amendment No. 76, which is my hon. Friend's redrafting of clause 48(3):—
	<br><q><p>"Where, within the re-registration period, an old public company applies to be re-registered under section 8 above as a public company, then—

If the company gives its own name before re-registration it is relieved of any offence. My amendment seeks to add in to that the relief from section 108(1)(	<i>a</i>) of the 1948 Act, the one to which I referred previously, about having one's name painted or affixed outside the office where the business is carried on. I do not need to elaborate that argument because I have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>320</span>
already referred to it in dealing with amendment No. 196.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One matter arises out of my hon. Friend's amendment No. 76. As I see it, it relieves the public company, for a period of 12 months after its re-registration, of having a seal with the full name on it. I suggest that this is not a necessary relief. I submit that one thing which the company ought to do immediately it has its new name, that is, its old name plus "public limited company," is to have its seal changed. That is a formality which has to be used in order to give legal title from time to time to the company's disposals or acquisitions. I see no difficulty in having a new seal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give an example. If a company disposes of some real property and puts its seal on the deed, it will be necessary for future purchasers looking at the title to that property to inquire whether, if the seal does not include "PLC" on it, the seal had been affixed within 12 months of the re-registration. The purchasers would have to search the companies register to find out when it was re-registered and calculate the date. It would give a considerable amount of trouble in the actual title to the property. I suggest that the company ought not to be excused from having its new seal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My purpose in suggesting amendments to the Government amendments to clause 48 is to simplify matters as much as possible. My hon. Friend has gone a little way in simplifying them in his amendments and I hope that my amendments may be accepted so that we may go a little further in simplifying the procedure for re-registration of the new old public companies, if I may put it that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it may be for the convenience of the Committee if, in seeking to reply to the questions raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), I begin by explaining the purpose and effect of Government amendments Nos. 75, 76 and 77. The amendments are concerned with the time to be allowed for public companies to make the changeover from their old to their new name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This question was raised in another place, and the Government undertook to introduce amendments to the clause to ensure that the provision did not cause
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>321</span>
industry unnecessary difficulties and expense. I am sure that we all agree with that approach. The amendments are on the basis outlined in another place on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 48 as drafted makes it an offence for a company to trade under a misleading name, whether it be a non-public company using the designation "public limited company" or a public company using a designation which suggests that it is a private company. However, the clause permits old public companies re-registered as public to continue to use their old name during the six months following re-registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the representations we have received, it was clear that this timescale for the changeover of names by public companies was not sufficient. The amendments we propose therefore make significant changes to the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take, first, amendment No. 75. We consider that the offence of a public company using a name which implies that it is a private company should be restricted to circumstances in which its status is likely to be material. This would mean that if a public company used its old name in circumstances where it clearly would not matter to anyone that it was a public company, it would not be committing an offence under the clause. However, in circumstances where it was likely to matter, public companies would not be allowed to use their old names once they were re-registered. We consulted quite widely on the proposed amendment and this change was welcomed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is that while I think that the Government's goal on this matter is seeking to achieve the right kind of balance, there is a great area of uncertainty in construing the relevant words
	<br><q><p>"likely to be material to."</p></q>
If it were a more important issue, it could promote all kinds of anxieties. That is not likely in practice to be quite so important, but does the hon. Gentleman not think that those are rather unsatisfactory terms that are likely to give rise to a good deal of uncertainty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Inevitably, when a change of this kind is made under the main provisions of the Bill there are bound to be transitional difficulties, of all of which we are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>322</span>
trying to take reasonable account. There is the further point raised by the hon—. Memeber for Hackney, Central (Mr. Clinton Davis) about interpretation of the amendments. We shall proceed carefully and try at every stage to produce as much clarity as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 76 allows a more generous time for companies to make the changeover from their old to their new name for the purposes of the Companies Act and other legislative requirements. The amendment deals separately with the requirements of section 108 of the 1958 Act and those of provisions of other legislation. Therefore, I shall deal with them separately as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 108 relates to the publication of a company's name outside its place of business, on its seal, on its business letters, notices, official publications and so on. We propose that 12 months should be allowed for the changeover of names by public companies for these purposes. It was widely accepted to be an appropriate length of time to allow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding the point raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby on the nature of the wording of the seal, which I agree is important evidence of company approval, we received representations that it might cause difficulty to make the change in the seal immediately on re-registration. I suppose that it would be difficult for all companies to change the situation immediately. That is why we thought, on the basis of consideration, that it would be right to include the requirements with regard to the seal in the provision which allows 12 months for adjustment. Having said that, we shall carefully consider the matter again on the basis of the points that have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the amendment provides that three years would be allowed for interchangeability of the old and new names for the provisions of other legislation. This means that labelling regulations, which require the correct name of the company to be shown, would apply to those three years as if the correct name of the company was either its old or its new name. This is an important relaxation, as many projects covered by such regulations are subject to a fairly long lead time for production and it would cause unnecessary expense and problems for industry if only a short changeover period was allowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may add at this stage that amendment No. 77 is purely a drafting
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>323</span>
mendment. The amendments we propose are not so much technical as practical improvements to the Bill. They make significant changes to the clause, as I have explained, and the changes we propose have been widely welcomed. I hope, therefore, that the amendments will be acceptable to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to amendment No. 196 and sub-amendments (b) and (c) to amendment No. 76. These all relate to section 108(1)(	<i>a</i>)of the 1948 Act. As I understand it, amendment No. 196 and sub-amendment (b) to amendment No. 76, as moved by my right hon. Friend, are alternatives, with sub-amendment (c) being consequential on sub-amendment (b). Amendment No. 196 suggests that section 108(1)(a) of the 1948 Act should be repealed. Sub-amendment (b) to amendment No. 76, on the other hand, would provide that any provisions of section 108(1)(a) shall apply as if any reference in that provision to the name of the company were a reference to the name of the old public company before or after re-registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first question is, therefore, whether it is desirable to retain section 108(1)(a) at all. The proposal that it should be repealed was, in fact, a recommendation made to us by the Committee of London Clearing Bankers. Perhaps it would be of interest to hon. and right hon. Members if I outlined the background to the suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When this Bill was introduced in another place, the Committee of London Clearing Bankers pressed us to extend the time given in the clause for old public companies which become public companies to make the changeover to their new name. The committee asked for a period for all purposes of 12 months, which indeed was the length of time it had asked for in representations on the 1978 Bill. One of the reasons the committee gave was the difficulty of replacing the stainless steel or, sometimes, brass plates outside banks within six months. My right hon. Friend quite properly dwelt at length on the difficulties in this respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to say that in our proposed amendments under consideration today, we have fully met the Committee of London Clearing Bankers' request in respect of the 12-months time scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we now reach a position in which this morning. like Oliver, the committee has come back and asked for more. It has asked that we remove the provision
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>324</span>
in section 108(1)(	<i>a</i>) completely. I can quite see that it is in human nature that when one has got what one asked for—and indeed, having seen some other people get rather more; for in our amendments we are allowing a three-year changeover period for provisions other than section 108, though we think that is right;—it is tempting to come back and ask for more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background, perhaps we might now look at the substance. The provision in section 108(1)(	<i>a</i>) goes back to the Companies Act 1862. Section 41 of that Act is a relevant provision, and I quote it:—
	<br><q><p>"Every Limited Company under this Act, whether limited by shares or by guarantee, shall paint or affix, and shall keep painted or affixed."—</p></q>
unless it is within the use of the word "scratch", as suggested by my right hon. Friend—
	<br><q><p>"its name on the outside of every office or place in which the Business of the Company is carried on in a conspicuous position, in letters easily legible."</p></q>
It seems to us that this requirement on a company to show its name outside its place of business is both necessary and sensible. It is not an onerous requirement, although it may not always be obeyed. However, I point out to my right hon. Friend that outside the place of business does not necessarily mean the premises themselves. Of course, for reasons of their own, there is a strong reason why the banks wish to display their names outside the premises in a prominent way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe it is a sensible requirement and, on balance, we would be losing a worthwhile and sensible provision if it was replaced. Indeed, we have not received any other representations suggesting that it should be repealed. I realise that it could be expensive for the banks to fulfil the requirement if they chose to do so with brass plates, but there are less expensive ways of doing it. That, of course, is for them to decide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They have got a lot of brass.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby will no doubt want to report that comment to the clearing banks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost involved is the main argument put forward by the committee of the London clearing bankers in the memo-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0180">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>325</span>
randum which was sent to this Committee in support of the sub-amendment. However, the committee also suggested that, prior to the 1948 Act, there was no obligation on a company to mention its name on business letters, and so on. That was provided for in section 108(1)(	<i>a</i>) of the 1948 Act. But if is misleading. The 1862 Act provided not only for the publication of the name of the company outside its place of business, but that,
	<br><q><p>"every limited company should have its name engraven in legible characters on its seal and shall have its name mentioned in legible characters in all notices, advertisements and other official publications of such company, and in all bills of exchange, promissory notes, endorsements, cheques and orders for money or goods purporting to be signed by or on behalf of such company and in all bills, parcels, invoices, receipts and letters of credit of the company."</p></q>
That provision, based on the 1862 Act, was repeated in section 93 of the 1929 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The small change made by the 1947 Act—it was not the 1948 Act, which was a consolidation measure—was to substitute the words "business letters" for "advertisemen" in the equivalent provision of the 1929 Act. The reason for the insertion of "business letters" in the 1947 Act was that the Cohen committee said that there were certain doubts about whether the term "official publications" covered business letters. Therefore, this was not a major change in the provisions on the publication of a name, and can hardly be prayed in aid of the Committee of London Clearing Bankers argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will agree that, as this is a useful provision which has not caused any other concern, we should retain it as part of our company law, and that my right hon. Friend will not press amendment No. 196.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the question raised by our amendment No. 76, with the associated amendment (b), that is, whether old public companies which become public companies should be allowed in perpetuity to have either their old or their new name outside their place of business. I think that we should be quite clear about what this would mean. The directive says that the names of public companies must be different from that of private companies. In the Bill, this is achieved by the provisions for re-registration as public companies and the adoption by public companies of the designation "plc".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>326</span>
I think that we must recognise that if we said that public companies could use either such a name "public limited company "—which is distinguished from a private company's name—or its old name "limited", which is indistinguishable, we would not be complying with the directive. I do not think, therefore, that we can allow a public company for ever and a day to meet the provision on displaying its names outside its business by showing a name which leads one to suppose that it is a private company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To say that public companies must have names which distinguish them from private companies, but then to go on to say that they can continue on a permanent basis to use some other name which does not distinguish them is to flout the directive. I am sure that my right hon. Friend will agree that we should not do that. There is an enormous difference between a limited, transitional relaxation justified on practical grounds, which is what we have proposed in our amendments, and the unlimited, permanent derogation contained in the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend again refer to what he said about the use of the company's seal, because I agree with what he said about putting names outside of buildings? I believe that is absolutely right, and that it would be misleading, apart from not complying with the directive. However, to allow the wrong name to be used on a company's documents would be quite wrong, and I do not believe that the argument about the expenditure involved in changing seals is the same argument as that about expenditure on advertising the company's name outside of premises. Therefore, I believe that we may safely require the seal to be changed as of the day of the change of name.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point, which is eminently reasonable and practical, it strongly supports the point made earlier by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby. I assure my hon. Friend that we shall again look at this matter of the seal and its special significance for the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we may now turn to sub-amendment (a) to Government amendment No. 75. The sub-amendment suggests that the offence of a public company using a name which implies
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0181">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>327</span>
that it is a private company should turn on whether the fact that it is a public company is material to any person, rather than is likely to be material, as is proposed in the Government amendment. This suggestion was put to us by the Boots Company Ltd., the Confederation of British Industry, and the British Multiple Retailers Association. The reason for it is that it was thought that the wording proposed in Government amendment No. 75 would give rise to semantic and theoretical arguments and uncertainty as to when a risk of liability might arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one looks at the new offence with which it is concerned, one sees that it is really very narrow. It is where it was likely to matter to someone that the public company was such, and was not private. Such circumstances are likely to be relatively few, and will arise only where different rules apply to public and to private companies, and the person misled would be prejudiced by the belief that the company he was dealing with was private when, in fact, it was public. Hon. Members are aware, for example, of the different rules for public companies in the Bill on the issue of share capital and so forth. As I said, there are by no means many circumstances in which it would matter to someone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it must be recalled that the purpose of having such an offence—trading under a misleading name—is to protect people who would otherwise suffer from not realising that the public company was such a company. I do not think, therefore, that it is too much to expect of public companies that they should be a little careful in this respect and ensure that they avoid creating such confusion where it might be important to someone. This is all we would be asking of them, and I do not think that it is at all unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment proposed by the Government would not, I think, give rise to the academic disputes that were feared by the CBI and others. The status of the company would have to be shown by the prosecution to be "likely to be material", and I should perhaps stress that any prosecution would, of course, have to establish the offence beyond reasonable doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one further reason why we prefer the wording of amendment No.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>328</span>
75 as it stands. It is that one has to bear in mind the possible case where, quite beyond any company's reasonable expectation, and despite the exercise of reasonable care by the company, the use of its old name proved to be material to someone. I do not think that any of us would want to impose criminal sanctions in such a case. However, that would be the result if we were to accept sub-amendment (a).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all these reasons, I think that the wording in amendment No. 75 is preferable. I do not think that the much narrower offence that we are now proposing will cause any problems for public companies which take the care that one would expect of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) is worried by the use of the word "likely". I believe that it is used quite often in taxation legislation, and the courts interpret it and feel reasonably happy with it. So I do not share my right hon. Friend's worry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that observation. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) will take account of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I should like the Committee to look at subamendment (b). As far as we can see, it is purely a drafting change. Instead of the reference to using a name which is likely to give a certain impression, my right hon. Friend suggests that we refer to using a name which may reasonably give that impression. It is almost a matter of taste. However, we think that subamendment (b) would read a little more awkwardly and we are therefore not inclined to support it. I hope that my right hon. Friend will consider that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that I am therefore recommending that we do not accept any of these subamendments. However, I hope that my right hon. Friend and other members of the Committee will agree that the reasons I have given are good. I accept the views that have been expressed about the matter of the seal, and I promise that there will be further consideration of that aspect. I hope that in the light of my remarks my right hon. Friend will not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my' hon. Friend for what he said about the question of the seal. After ail, it stands apart from the other provisions. The seal is not likely to mislead the public, but it could cause great difficulty if it is not correct. I am therefore glad that my hon. Friend will look again at that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to amendment No. 75 and the use of the word "likely" in two places, I think that the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) used the correct word. He said that there are anxieties about the interpretation of the amendment. There is no doubt that there are anxieties, judging by the representations we have received from outside the House. There are two questions in respect of the use of the word "likely" as used twice in the amendment. By using it twice in that way, the offence can be committed in purely hypothetical cases. I suggest that it is all wrong that we should create an offence on pure hypothesis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the subsection itself:
	<br><q><p>"A public company other than an old public company shall be guilty of an offence".</p></q>
The amendment seeks to say:
	<br><q><p>"in circumstances in which the fact that it is a public company is likely to be material to any person"</p></q>
It will not be necessary for the prosecution to prove that it has been material to any person at all; merely that it is likely to be material. I should have thought that, if we are to create an offence—and quite a serious offence—it should be a definite fact and not a hypothetical case as to whether it may hypothetically be material to that person. It should be a firm statement that it is an offence if the matter is material to that person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of the amendment says:
	<br><q><p>"a name which is likely to give the impression that it is a private company."</p></q>
Again, that is purely hypothetical. Someone goes into the witness box and says "This is likely to give the impression that it is a private company". Either the matter gives the impression or it does not. I have even turned that down in my subamendment and said "may reasonably" give that impression. I suggest that that is more acceptable in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>330</span>
law than the word "likely". My hon. Friend said that the word "likely" is used in taxation. Heaven forbid that we should" use the drafting of the Taxes Act in company law. The drafting of the Taxes Act is a matter of art in itself, apart from the drafting of any other measure. I should hate to adopt any of the drafting of those Acts in any other Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to section 108 (1)(	<i>a</i>) of the 1948 Act. I assure my hon Friend—and I think that he will recollect—that I did not plead, as the clearing banks did, that there was a material alteration in the law at that time. I studied law, I fear, a considerable time before then, and I recollect in my student days learning the provision about companies' names being on their notepaper—in fact, I remember having to make certain that the name was on all the documents when I had the job of forming new companies. I did not plead that point, therefore. I know that it was a minor amendment in 1948. There is no reason for retaining this provision merely because of its antiquity. I know that it goes back to 1862, but the fact that it is not now observed is surely a substantial argument for saying "Do not let us repeat it now".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that we had representations on this matter from the clearing banks, and perhaps my hon. Friend is right to say "We gave them 12 months; now they want the lot". They are Oliver Twists who come back for more. Let us forget about the banks for the moment. What about commercial premises, firms which would perhaps prefer to have their one name rather than elaborating on the full name? They may wish to be known as Wimpey's, for example, or whatever name it may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about shop facias? We have become familiar with just a name across the front of a shop without "limited" at the end of it. Indeed, in many places where business is carried on, the nature or name of the goods sold—for example, in tobacconists' and so on—is more prominently displayed than the name of the shop or the company which runs the shop. In fact, sometimes it is not displayed at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One must take this right across the board and not concentrate only on the clearing banks, which happen to have put up a god case and to show that if
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0183">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

they are elegant in affixing or painting the names of banks outside their premises they will have to provide new plates at a cost of £million, which will all go on to our bank charges in one way or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that my hon. Friend should look at this again, although I say at once that I accept his point about relief in respect of use of the old name. It would be misleading, and therefore I do not press my amendment on that
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I want now is deletion entirely of the provision about having to affix and paint the company's name outside the premises. I do not think that in modern conditions it is necessary to make the absence of that an offence by the company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) has made, I must go hack to my earlier remarks and ask him again to consider that there is a further reason why we prefer the wording of amendment No. 75 as it stands. One has to bear in mind the possible case where, quite beyond any company's reasonable expectation, and despite the exercise of reasonable care by the company, the use of its old name proves to be material to someone: None of us would want to oppose criminal sanctions in such a case. However, that would he the result if we were to accept my right hon. Friend's amendment (a). I therefore ask him to consider that carefully and not to press it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

His subamendment would impose a criminal sanction in such a case. This is unlikely but it sometimes happens. I must ask my right hon. Friend to consider that carefully.

On the outstanding question about notices outside places of business, I still feel that there is particular difficulty for the banks. I accept what my right hon. Friend said, that there is a tendency to use forms of advertisement in the use of names, and I agree that the situation now is not entirely as it was in 1862, but I ask him to consider this point, especially with regard to banks. What ever the provision at law, the banks will be intent on putting their name outside. their premises. There are good reasons why banks want to do that, and I imagine that they will continue the practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the basis of the requirement that if they put their name outside the premises it has to comply strictly with the requirements in the Bill, as amended, with regard to the nature of the name, I do not see how the banks can be relieved of that obligation. This problem arises, especially for banks, out of the nature of the directive and the change of name. For those reasons, though I.sympathise with the banks because they' are in a special position, they would any way be obliged to do it however we

The circumstances of banks, which arouse my sympathy, are special, and I am sorry that they have this obligation, but I do not think that we can change matters in any way that would be helpful to them with regard to this provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be clear to the Committee by now that it is incumbent upon a public company to show that it is not a private company. That comes in the second directive and is repeated in the Bill. It can show that either by having in full after its name the words "public limited company" or, according to clause 50 to which my amendment applies, using the letters "p.l.c."—an extremely inelegant form of addition to a company's name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any initials as an abbreviation are unpleasant. Other people have found an abbreviation, such as "Inc." in America, or—one can only pronounce this as "Pippety"—"Ppty" in other countries. They are not elegant, so I sought an abbreviation of "public limited company" using a word rather than initials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said on a previous amendment, initials can be misleading. "Plc" can stand for public limited company or private limited company. Indeed, it can stand for public lavatory convenience or plastic loo chain or anything like that. Unfortunately, if we try to abbreviate public limited company as "Inc." or the other name I mentioned, we get down to "Pub" and I did not think it appropriate to have that after, say, the name of a bank—"National Westminster Bank Pub" or even "Lloyds Pub".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have therefore tried to merge the words "public," "limited" and "company" into one word, and it came out as the very pleasant Latin word "publico." After all, these public companies are 	<i>pro bono publico,</i> so let us have the word "publico" after their names.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one point on which I should like to explore the Government's thinking on the matter of penalties. One of the penalties available under the Companies Act for aberrant directors applies under section 188 of the Companies Act 1948, relating to disqualification. Those provisions were strengthened in the Companies Act 1976 and the Insolvency Act 1976.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>337</span>
It occurred to us that it might be wise to ask the Government to reflect on this matter, although we have not tabled an amendment. If the courts are to utilise the provisions of the 1976 Act as well as the 1948 Act to a greater extent than they have previously, it might be advantageous to have a register of disqualified directors. That should not be a very onerous task. It would enable people to identify such persons far more readily than at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a court disqualified a director, it would be simple for the court to be able to notify Companies House of the position. A register should not prove to be a burdensome or bureaucratic piece of machinery to operate. I should like to know the Government's thinking on the general principle that I have adumbrated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman has suggested and see what would be the practical effect of preparing such a register and how it could be used to help people who might be misled in some way. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be satisfied with what I have said. We shall certainly consider the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<ol>

The amendment makes small changes to subsection (2). Clause 54 provides for the "authorised minimum", that is to say, the minimum issued capital required of a public company to be altered by, means of a statutory instrument. An order under the clause would be subject to an affirmative procedure. Subsection (2) seeks to provide the vires for the order to deal with the necessary mechanical issues.

To that extent, there is a similarity with what had to be laid down in part I. Having reconsidered the powers pro- vided in subsection (2), we have come to the conclusion that they do not work as a matter of mechanics. The amendment, therefore, replaces the present subsection (2) with a more realistic and workable provision. It is, to that extent, a drafting amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments make small changes to the definitions of the term "employees' share scheme". Amendment No. 192 extends the meaning to cover schemes which encourage or facilitate the holding of debentures by employees. The relevant reference in the Bill to employees' share schemes is in paragraph 11 of schedule 3, which amends section 55 of the 1948 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have explained, the Government have proposed an amendment to the latter provision. It is also sensible in this context to treat debentures to be held under an employees' share scheme in the same way as shares held under such a scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>340</span>
Government amendment No. 193 is a drafting amendment mainly to bring step-children as well as children under 18 in paragraph (b) of the definition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should he grateful if my hon. Friend would give us more enlightenment as to the precise significance of Government amendment No. 192, which seeks to include debentures with shares in employee share schemes. I have not given as much attention as I should to the provisions made for encouraging employee share schemes, but I am dubious whether we ought to facilitate the issue of debentures in such schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not hostile to the idea of such schemes being promoted and encouraged with tax concessions and in other ways, because it is a good idea to encourage wider share ownership and more general participation in the success of industry, but I do not particularly welcome the use of employee share schemes if they are primarily seen by management as a way of providing a new source of capital which is so dispersed that it does not threaten the controlling interest of the directors, or where the rights of employees are strictly limited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, debentures are not a popular form of investment for the obvious reason that inflation steadily erodes the asset and most people prefer to put their savings into equities which give them some reasonable hope that their income and capital will move along with the depreciation in the value of money and they will not suffer too badly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If employee share schemes are to invest in debentures, there will be friction when employees discover the character of the asset which their employers have given them. A debenture holder suffers from the erosion of capital through inflation and repayment is easy because the lender has been forced to accept a steady writing down of his capital with the passage of time. Is it fair to employees to use their savings in that way? Does it not frustrate the whole idea of an employee share scheme, which is to give employees an added incentive to improve the success of the business?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debenture, being characteristically an investment at a fixed interest, is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0188">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>341</span>
payable ahead of all other classes of share. It does not particularly matter to the debenture holder whether the company does well or badly, because the rights of the equity shareholders and the other classes of capital rank under the rights of the debenture holder. Therefore it seems to be a dubious provision that we should be making it easier for employee share schemes to spread into the issue of debentures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, when I look back—I may have been too hasty—to clause 14, which is the point at which the question primarily arises, I notice that subsection (6) states that companies may simply adopt an ordinary resolution in order to vary their articles to launch an employee share scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to place obstacles in the way of employee share schemes, but if it is contemplated that we may be permitting the creation of a class of capital ahead of all other shares in the business on behalf of the employees, ought there not to be more provision to warn the other shareholders than an ordinary resolution? Ought we not at least to have an ordinary resolution on special notice, even if we do not insist on an extraordinary resolution?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have for some time felt that we need a new class of dynamised debentures which would be founded on the principle that the distribution would be tied to the value added in the company. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary may laugh, but it will only encourage me to dilate on the subject at greater length. My concept of a dynamised debenture is an asset which ranks ahead of the equity, which has been too much cultivated during the period of the cult of the equity, and yet is able to live in a climate in which inflation is still continuing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the dynamised debenture, as I still prefer to call it, had a distribution which was tied to the value added and the increase in the net worth of the company, that would protect the investors by giving them a direct interest in the success of the firm. At the same time, however, the payment on the debenture would not fall due so long as the company was active, even if it were not profitable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, I hope that my hon.

If that is the effect of the amendment, as it appears, it will be highly undesirable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At first sight, the amendment may look a little strange. However, I assure the Committee that there is good reason for it. The amendment relates to amendment No. 194, which has not yet been reached. That amendment relates to paragraph 11 of schedule 3, which in turn amends section 55 of the 1948 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All these provisions relate to defining what amounts to an offer of shares or debentures to the public. Right hon. and hon. Members will recall that clause 15 prohibits private limited companies from offering shares or debentures to the public. I do not want to anticipate the debate on amendment No. 194, but I must stress that it is an important issue as it will vitally affect the ability of private companies to raise capital, whether by issuing shares or debentures, from existing shareholders and employees. Amendment No. 194 proposes that, among other things, an offer—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not discussing amendment No. 194.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I appreciate that Sir Stephen. I shall limit my remarks to the proposed amendment, but for the purpose of explaining it I need to make brief reference to another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that other amendment an offer under an employee share scheme should not amount to an offer to the public. However, without amendment No. 192 an offer of shares would fall within the employee share scheme exemptions, but an offer of debentures would not do so because of the limited definition of such schemes. That is the reason for amendment No. 192. I hope that that explains
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0189">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>343</span>
the amendment. If, when we debate amendment No. 194, the Committee decides on some other approach which makes amendment No. 192 unnecessary, we can remove it on Report. I doubt that will happen, but, if so, we can return to the matter on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not presumed to refer to the reservations which my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) expressed when he referred to debentures. I fully understand his reservations about debentures in the present circumstances. It is possible that in the course of economic history a situation will arise when circumstances are different and debentures can be a favourable form of investment, as they have been at other times. But I do not presume in any way to debate that because there will be an opportunity to consider the matter on a later amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) has raised an important point. We are in difficulties. I appreciate that the merits of this arise on a later amendment. Here we are dealing with the definition of the employees' share scheme. This already has a meaning given to it in the amendment to which my hon. Friend referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accept the amendment now, we are prejudicing the discussion on amendment No. 194. We would here be accepting that an employees' share scheme shall be a scheme for encouraging or facilitating the holding of shares or debentures—not shares and debentures. If we accept this definition in future an employees' share scheme need have nothing at all to do with the equity of the company. It could be merely a scheme for the company to borrow money—to raise a fixed loan and not to dispose of its equity capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have in front of me two well-known employees' share schemes that are used as models for other schemes. They make no mention of debentures and they are fairly modern schemes. No one seems to have thought of that, and I do not wonder. I have never thought of it before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are schemes such as these examples in which there can be an issue of capitalisation shares—an issue of bonus shares. Are we to have an issue of capitalisation debentures? Will a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>344</span>
company issue some of its reserves to its employees in future to be treated as straight loans to the company? It raises entirely new questions if we are to understand employees' share schemes as being schemes which can operate quite apart from any equity interest in the capital, and interest which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington said, is an encouragement to the employee to see that his company is successful.

A debenture may well be an encouragement for the employee to see that the company is not successful in order that he may get his money back. He will have the right to put it into liquidation and get his money back—the whole of his money, unlike an equity share in the company. He has no incentive whatever to make the company successful when he is a debenture holder. It is just a straight investment. This raises a new point.

I pass to amendment No. 193, which is to insert, after "children", "or step-children". I wonder whether this definition of "children" includes illegitimate as well as legitimate children. Does it also include adopted children?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate fully the points raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) regarding debentures. Unfortunately, we shall not reach amendment No. 194, which would give us the opportunity properly to debate that matter, until a later stage. I ask my right hon. Friend and my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) to agree that we should make this amendment now on the understanding that at a later stage, if it is felt to be inappropriate, we shall certainly reconsider the matter. But that will be after we have had a proper opportunity to debate the broader principles which my right hon. and hon. Friends are raising now. I ask them to take the matter on trust until later in the proceedings. I hope that they will agree to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend asked whether the word "children" in amendment No. 193 included illegitimate children. I am advised that the answer to that is "No". He then asked if it included adopted children, and I am happy to say that the answer to that is "Yes". I hope that those two answers will satisfy my right hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a matter of distrusting my hon. Friend or a matter of discourtesy to him or anything of that sort, but I think that we are doing this the wrong way round. We are being asked to put something in the Bill which may remain there if we accept a later amendment; but if we do not accept that later amendment, it will be taken out on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the right way to proceed is to wait and see whether we accept that amendment and whether further amendments are, therefore, needed. Then we could put in on Report what we are being asked to put in now, if we accept that amendment. In my experience in dealing with Committee stages and Report stages of Bills, I have often found that I have precluded myself from raising something by agreeing to an amendment which has seemed a purely technical amendment at the stage then reached. I am highly suspicious of being prevented from fully arguing the further amendment on the Paper if we have accepted the present amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my hon. Friend to treat us with the trust with which he is asking us to treat him. I think that what I have suggested is the right procedure in this case—that he can amend this clause on Report, as he wishes to amend it now, only if we accept the later amendment which makes this amendment necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in a certain difficulty, because I naturally wish to comply with the hopes that my hon. Friend has expressed. But I have not had time to study the full implications of amendment No. 194, which, on a superficial reading, appears to apply only to private companies anyway. I join my right hon. Friend in appealing to my hon. Friend not to force us to accept at this stage the addition of these words "or debentures ", because in my experience there is nothing more permanent than the temporary. If this morning we decide to allow employee shares schemes to change their character and become employee debenture loans, we may find, when we are debating amendment No. 194, that we can only partially undo the damage that we have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, however, when we have more opportunity to look into the matter and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>346</span>
have had further time for consultation and study of the issue, we think that the addition of the words "or debentures" is appropriate, it can be so easily done on Report in a matter of minutes. But if the amendment is accepted this morning, I have fears that we may find ourselves in a tangle later. I ask my hon. Friend, therefore, not to press the amendment this morning in order to allow us time to appreciate the implications fully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Since all the assurances that I have given in that respect have not been satisfactory, and my right hon. Friend and my hon. Friend have expressed deep suspicion today, I feel that I have no choice but to withdraw the amendment. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 168 and 167 are drafting amendments which, in part, are needed to clarify the provisions of the Bill on the meaning of "cash and" non-cash asset" and partly as a consequence of the changes which are made necessary by earlier amendments, in particular, the amendment which simplifies clause 24(1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 168 makes clear that while the expression "non-cash asset"
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0191">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>347</span>
which appears in clause 26 covers any kind of property or interest in property other than cash, it does not cover the release of a liability for a liquidated sum which, while not strictly speaking cash, is for practical purposes the equivalent of a money payment and is treated as such throughout the Bill. This is already reflected in the definition of "transfer of a non-cash asset" in clause 56(2)(	<i>b</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 167 is needed to clarify what is meant by "payment up in cash" and "allotment for cash ", and the converse expressions "payment up otherwise than in cash "and" consideration other than cash ". The effect of the amendment would be that payment of cash to the company in question, or the giving of a cheque to it, or the release of a liability of its for a liquidated sum, or a promise to pay cash to it at a future date, will be treated as cash and will not, for example, require valuation under clause 24.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, any other kind of payment to, or release of a liability of the company or anyone else, and in particular a payment of cash to a person other than the company, while it may well be good consideration for an allotment of shares will not be treated as cash for the purposes of the Bill and will require valuation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These amendments do not change the effect of the Bill but are merely consequential upon the simplification of the drafting adopted under earlier amendments, and I hope that the Committee will accept them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 169, in page 64, line 8, leave out "land" and insert "any property ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment relates to the question of what is meant by a "transfer of a non-cash asset ". This phrase no longer appears as frequently as it did in the Bill as a result of previous Government amendments. However, it is still used in clause 26 and we therefore still need to define what is meant by it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As presently drafted, clause 56 states that for the purposes of the Bill any reference to the transfer of a non-cash asset includes a reference to the creation or extinction of an estate or interest in, or a right over, land and also a reference to the discharge of any person's liability, other than a liability for a liquidated sum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society has pointed out to us that there is no reason for confining the application of this paragraph to the creation or extinction of estates, and so on, in land. The Law Society argues that this would appear to exclude leases of chattels, patent and trademark licences and contractual rights generally, from the definition of the transfer of non-cash assets. We accept that point. Clearly, such things should come within the meaning of "transfer of a non-cash asset". To ensure that this is the case, the amendment replaces the reference to "land" in clause 56(2) with a reference to "any property".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may intervene briefly to make my customary protest about legislation by reference. The first definition in clause 56 states:
	<br><q><p>"'accounting reference period' has the meaning given by section 2 of the 1976 Act;"</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0192">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

I carry all kinds of things around with me—a driving licence, a banker's card and a diary, but I do not carry the 1976 Act. Do practitioners, shareholders, company directors and people who have occasion to want to know about these things have to go to a library, take down the 1976 Act and look it up?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point was made earlier by the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) that if we overlook a protest which we might make on an amendment we weaken our case at a later stage. I ought to have leapt wildly to my feet on amendment No. 241, in which we are told that a hire-purchase agreement has the same meaning as in the Consumer Credit Act 1974. I do not carry that around, either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This point has been referred to recently. It was mentioned at some length in the Renton report, and we all agreed about it at the time. We always agree in principle, and then draftsmen, no doubt under all kinds of pressures, insist on returning to legislation by reference. I shall not make a meal of it, but could we be told whether it is absolutely necessary, or could we be informed in the text what the text means without being sent off to do some research?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have much sympathy with the view expressed by the right hon. and learned Member. I feel that matters will be much improved after we have been able to move to consolidation. We referred to this on Second Reading and, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman knows, as we proceed with the complicated Committee stage of the Bill some amendments are intended to facilitate the move towards consolidation. We shall have substantial legislation in the next Session, with the 1980–81 Companies Bill, but I assure him that we have constantly in mind the need for consolidation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. and learned Gentleman is absolutely right about that, and we shall be happy indeed when we are able to move substantially along that road, much to the relief of practitioners who have to struggle with these problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect to my hon. Friend, who said that this will be put right in the consolidation Bill, I can draw on considerable experience
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>350</span>
late at night, with only the Solicitor-General on the other side of the Table, with no one taking the slightest interest, and Mr. Speaker calling one to order on every possible occasion on a consolidation Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say that if the draftsman repeats this in the consolidation Bill—it is, after all, his job, to repeat what is in an existing Act—there will be no chance to amend it there. So I join the right hon. and learned Gentleman in laying down a marker here. I should like to see—certainly in the definition clause—a repeat of the definitions, without having to look up another Bill. I have no faith in the promise that it will be put right in the consolidation Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that one cannot get it right after the consolidation Bill has been printed. The only amendment that is in order on the consolidation Bill is one which amends the date on which it will come into operation. That is the only thing one can argue when a consolidation Bill comes before the House, unless it happens to have in it some amendments which have been made by the Joint Committee on the Consolidation of Bills. It is quite impossible to amend a definition—if that is repeated—similar to that to which the right hon. and learned Gentleman has objected. I am glad, therefore that he has laid down the marker and I join with him in doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Joint Committee on the Consolidation of Bills will take note of what we are saying here and will not repeat this kind of definition with a consolidation Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult for me to give a full and adequate reply to all the points raised by my right hon.
