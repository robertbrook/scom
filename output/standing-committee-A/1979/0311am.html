	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>EMPLOYMENT BILL</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Goodhew. Since our last sitting the Government have tabled new clause 12 and an amendment to leave out the present clause 13, so one assumes that that new clause 12 is intended to replace the present clause 13.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find new clause 12 one of incredible complexity. In accordance with common practice, we have an explanatory and financial memorandum to the Bill. I doubt whether the explanatory memorandum which relates to the present clause 13 is an adequate guide to new clause 12. Trying to steer my way through new clause 12, I thought that it required the combined navigational talents of Vasco da Gama, Marco Polo and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States. I wonder therefore whether the Government intend to give us any guidance about new clause 12.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall have some time before we reach the new clause, and I hope that I may suggest through you, Mr. Goodhew, that the Government should look at the possibility of giving something like a Keeling schedule, because of the number of cross-references between the provisions of new clause 12, the provisions of the present Bill and the provisions of the 1978 Act. It might be useful to have something which would show these new provisions in the context of the 1978 Act, and I ask the Government to look seriously at that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the meantime, I hope that the Government will be prepared to give us some guidance on what new clause 12 means and, if there are any changes of significance and substance between the new clause and existing clause 13, what those changes are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition find themselves confronted with an additional difficulty. We have tabled some amendments to the existing clause 13. I am not quite sure, Mr. Goodhew, how you would suggest that we should go ahead procedurally, but I find it difficult to see how we can transfer those amendments to the present clause 13 into
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1048</span>
the context of new clause 12. I hope that the Government will give us some indication of what they will do to help the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has proved his prowess in navigating in very tricky waters in this Committee before now, but I understand his difficulty and I am sure that the Under-Secretary would like to help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment [Mr. Patrick Mayhew]</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Goodhew. I am happy to confirm that the procedure which has led to the setting down of new clause 12 has been discussed through the usual channels. I think that I can properly say that the purpose of the procedure—I acknowledge that it appears a formidable document—is, first, to permit the necessary amendments which the Government believe desirable to be more readily incorporated into the Bill than if we were to try to put them into existing clause 13. Second, the advantage of the procedure is that it gives the Opposition greater time to consider the new provisions which are sought to be added and to table whatever amendments they may wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that it is necessary to have an explanatory document I undertake that we shall provide one for the Committee in the same way as we have for the Bill as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the right hon. Gentleman's suggestion about a cross-reference to the earlier Act and I undertake to see what can be done there. It is a very sensible suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of amendments to the existing clause 13, the sensible course would be for that to be discussed through the usual channels. The Government wish the Opposition to have the widest opportunity to table amendments to the substantive provisions. That is best left to discussion through the usual channels. Indeed, it was specifically with the object of giving them the greatest opportunity in terms of time that we proposed to put this into a new clause, since that will be taken later than an amendment to clause 13 would have been taken. I hope that that makes it clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

right hon. Friend said, we are grateful for the assurances, but we need the explanatory memorandum rather earlier than normal, in time for us to put down amendments if we wish to, on the basis of that explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, certainly. I shall do my best to see that it is available not later than Thursday. I hope that that has not struck horror into certain other people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>CONTRIBUTION IN RESPECT OF COMPENSATION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 124, in page 10, line 33, leave out from beginning of line 33 to "to" in line 34 and insert

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I explain at once that if my appearance is a little more odd than usual it is because, having inadvertently left my spectacles in my flat, I have had to borrow those of my hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Evans). They are a further navigational aid and I am deeply grateful for his help, but I hope that I am not impeded too much in trying to explain the purpose of our amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had a preliminary run over the ground of clause 9 and some of the matters in our amendments at our last sitting on Thursday evening. I speak first
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1050</span>
to amendment No. 125, which calls for the Bill to state specifically:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) Where any trade union or person is to be joined"</p></blockquote>
in proceedings before the tribunal in which compensation may be awarded, the tribunal
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall afford such trade union or person the same opportunity as the employer to present to the tribunal arguments concerning the question whether the employer's dismissal of the complainant was unfair."</p></blockquote>
The Under-Secretary gave us certain assurances on Thursday, but I question whether assurances are sufficient. We have had to make the point again and again—and I know it from hard and sometimes bitter experience—that what we intend and what the Government intend is not necessarily the way in which an Act may be subsequently interpreted and applied. We ought to have written into the Bill a specific obligation to give the individual or the trade union concerned the fullest opportunity to present their side of the case, and to put arguments as to why they should not be joined in proceedings and why compensation should not be awarded against them. It should be at the stage not where the essential decision about whether the dismissal was unfair and about the amount of compensation and against whom it should be levied is being discussed but at the stage, if the trade union or individuals concerned are to be joined, where the merits of the issue are discussed in the first place. That should be written in as a specific requirement so that the trade union or individuals concerned do not merely have to say why they should not have to pay compensation but can say why they should not be joined in the action at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill talks about a "person", and of course we understand that the singular here includes the plural and it may also relate to persons. My hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) referred to hypothetical situations where as many as 30 people could be involved, and I intervened to say that it might well be not 30 but 300. I made some references to the Langston and Goad cases which arose under the Industrial Relations Act. I took the trouble last evening to refresh my memory about these two cases, and I looked up the Law Reports in the Library.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Langston was an employee of a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1066">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1051</span>
firm called CAV, a large manufacturing company employing many thousands, and his conduct provoked a demonstration involving hundreds of people. The legal action that arose in his case was between himself and my own union, the AUEW, engineering section.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Donaldson, then presiding over the Industrial Relations Court, described the demonstration as comprising several hundred people and pointed out that many of them were not even members of the AUEW, engineering section. He quoted the senior shop steward who disclaimed any responsibility for the demonstration, saying that it was a purely spontaneous demonstration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The individuals who demonstrated were manifestly bringing pressure to bear for Mr. Langston to be dismissed, or not to be reinstated. In that situation, were these provisions enacted and applicable at the time, I wonder how they would have identified the person or persons who might be joined in a subsequent action before a tribunal for the award of compensation. Clearly, as some of the people were not members of the union, it would be very difficult merely to join the union. That would mean that it was only the union which would have to carry a penalty which, if it were to be awarded at all, ought to be distributed among others in addition to the union and its members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, I wonder what would happen if these provisions were enacted and the union, as in the case I have described, disclaimed any responsibility whatsoever. Even the chief stop steward insisted that it was spontaneous and not an organised demonstration. Again, this brings in the problem of numbers. How can large numbers of people—hundreds of people—be joined in an action? Yet to single out a few individuals would obviously be quite inequitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not sufficient to say that this is clearly impracticable because of the numbers and because of the difficulty of identifying the particular individuals, and therefore it is extremely unlikely that there will be any joining. We cannot say that because this provision when enacted would enable the employer to say that he wanted those individuals to be joined in the action. He could say "If compensation is to be awarded, why should I, who feel quite blameless in this matter, have to carry the financial burden?" In the case I have mentioned, a large company was
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1052</span>
involved and the employer may not have worried. He may have been glad to buy his way out of trouble. But, equally, it could have been one of the smaller firms that we hear so much about. The employer may say " I cannot afford the large sums of money involved—the £40,000 or so that it may be".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are running into all these practical difficulties illustrated by an actual event that occurred in 1974. In that situation—this shows the sums which may well be involved in these actions—the funds of the union were sequestrated to the tune of several scores of thousands of pounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A case which I can recall much more clearly was the other case to which I referred, that of Mr. James Goad, again an individual who, before the Industrial Relations Court, was involved in proceedings with the AUEW, engineering section. He was someone whom the AUEW excluded from membership. We have passed the part of the Bill which deals with exclusions, but it is still relevant to the kind of situations that may well arise under this clause. Mr. Goad had been excluded from membership of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers because he had exhausted the period allowed for arrears of contributions three times. A person in my union is allowed to run 26 weeks—a not ungenerous period—without paying a single contribution and only at the end of that is the union entitled to consider his membership lapsed and to assume that he has excluded himself. Mr. Goad had done this three times, only to re-enter the union, despite his arrears and his breach of the rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite that, the Industrial Relations Court held that Mr. Goad had been unfairly excluded from membership. He was then readmitted into the union, but his fellow workers refused to work with him. They thought he was a had egg. It was not the union but the chaps with whom he worked. The actual dispute there arose about his being denied access and admission to the functions of his trade union branch. But the question still holds good here. A group of workers "We want nothing to do with this chap—he is a bad egg—we prefer not to associate with him, whether it is in branch activities or in the workplace".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably, if this Bill had been enacted, in that kind of situation, where
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1067">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1053</span>
people were refusing to accept an individual into their company, those people could be joined in the action. How do we identify those who will be joined?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me round off the story by saying that in that case the union was initially required to appear before the Industrial Relations Court as being in breach of the court's ruling. Because of the policy of non-co-operation with the Industrial Relations Court, in its absence—because it failed to put in an appearance—the union was fined the sum of £50,000, together with £5,000 costs and a £5,000 fine. The union refused to pay, and large parts of its property and resources were sequestrated to meet the sums imposed by the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens if the chaps are joined and they refuse to pay? I come again to a point which has been a familiar theme throughout all these discussions not merely about this Bill but about this kind of legislative approach. I know what the hon. and learned Gentleman will say, and understandably so. Am I really arguing that trade unionists should defy the law of the land? I should be the first to say that I ought not to be in the House if I did not expect people to seek to obey the law. We also know—we have referred in Committee before to the views of the hon. Members for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) and for Carshalton (Mr. Forman)—that the law, in order to be effective, must command the tacit acceptance of those to whom it will apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this field there are many people who will feel that the law is unfairly discriminating against them and will therefore be reluctant to co-operate. However much we may deprecate that, we cannot ignore the facts of life. The reality has been illustrated in the cases to which I have referred. Under the Industrial Relations Act we repeatedly saw—whether it was right and proper or not—that people did not obey that law. They did not co-operate with it, and we know of the difficulties that arose with those large sequestrations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned two cases and here is a third, the ConMec case. I remember that when the incoming Labour Government took office in 1974 my union was faced with a sequestration order for £100,000 of its assets. We were powerless to do anything because we had to get that wretched Industrial Relations Act off the statute book first. So the action went
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1054</span>
ahead and my union had £100,000 of its assets sequestrated, and the sequestrators took £75,000 and gave the rest back to the union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those examples illustrate how large sums have been awarded against unions in the past—such as the AUEW—but it is a different matter if individuals refuse to pay, are subsequently held to be in contempt, and are then subject to fines and penalties awarded against them for being in contempt. The assets of a union can be sequestrated, but I do not know how that can be done against plain Joe Smith or Bill Brown. What happens then?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Send in the bailiffs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are the problems that the Government must face and explain how they envisage these things happening at the end of the road. One knows the position. It is unofficial action. The union has disclaimed all responsibility and may even have issued an instruction to its members "Obey the tribunal. Do as you are told." The members defy that. We then have the problem of large numbers of people involved and also the problem of identification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer again to what was said by the Attorney-General. On the assumption of later provisions of the Bill being enacted and thus being the law in relation to picketing, so that people were exposed to civil action in the courts if they were not employees of the employer whom they were picketing, how would the employer identify them? The Attorney-General replied with the advice "Use a camera and take picture of them." Presumably, one could then weigh it up afterwards and say "Yes, that's one of ours—oh no, he does not have his hair cut like that"—and so on. Perhaps the Attorney-General would offer the same advice here—use a camera. The milling hundreds demonstrating against Mr. Langston might be put on film to be run on a screen, as in the American movies we see where the detective picks out people on the screen—"Run it again, Joe. Stop it there. Yes, that is one of ours, that's him."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not trying to be frivolous. These are questions which the Government must face. One further point which is rather technical. At our last sitting I touched on the apparent inconsistency—nay, contradiction—between these provisions and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1068">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1055</span>
those of section 63 of the 1978 Act, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In determining, for the purposes of this Part any question as to the reason, or principal reason, for which an employee was dismissed or any question whether the reason or principal reason for which an employee was dismissed was a reason fulfilling the requirements of section 57(1) (	<i>b</i>) or whether the employer acted reasonably in treating it as sufficient reason for dismissing him,—
	<ol>
	<li>no account shall be taken of any pressure which, by calling, organising, procuring or financing a strike or other industrial action, or threatening to do so, was exercised on the employer to dismiss the employee, and</li>
	<li>any such question shall be determined as if no such pressure had been exercised."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The clause in the Bill says the opposite of that. It may be that I have not looked at the Bill with sufficient care, but I see nothing that would change section 63 in any way so as to enable clause 9 of the Bill to sit easily with it. I do not know whether I am drawing the Government's attention to something which they themselves have overlooked. It should be no part of my business on a Bill such as this to try to help them make their legislation more practicable and effective. However, I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman to explain whether there is a contradiction as I think there is, or have I overlooked something in the Bill? I hope also that he will deal with the more substantial matter that I have already advanced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have four amendments grouped here, and the right hon. Gentleman has confined his remarks almost entirely to No. 125. It will probably be convenient if I first deal with his comments on amendment No. 125 and come later to the earlier three amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of amendment No. 125 is to add a new subsection requiring the tribunal to afford the union or other person joined
	<br><blockquote><p>"the same opportunity as the employer to present … arguments concerning the question whether the employer's dismissal of the complainant was unfair."</p></blockquote>
The right hon. Gentleman said that it was important that where an employer has dismissed an employee and is at the sharp end of a claim for unfair dismissal and he wishes to join the union as a codefendant, as it were, the union ought to be have the fullest opportunity to defend itself. I took him to argue that it could not be limited to an ability to defend itself on the amount of compensation or contribu-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1056</span>
tion but that all relevant issues should be open to the union to defend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that comment I entirely agree. The Bill covers it. The power already exists. In so far as the purpose is to give the joined party an adequate opportunity to present its side of the case, this is already provided for in the practice and procedure of tribunals. Rule 7 of the current regulations governing tribunal procedures provides that any person entitled to appear
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall be entitled to make an opening statement, to give evidence, to call witnesses, to cross-examine any witnesses called by the other party, and to address the tribunal.</p></blockquote>
The union therefore will be able to challenge the employer's claim that the employer was induced to dismiss by any pressure on its part, or that any pressure was exercised because the employee was not a member of any particular trade union. It will also be able to challenge the basic question whether the dismissal was unfair These procedural rules, I submit, adequately protect the union, or the individual's right, if that is appropriate, to be heard in the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be helpful to set out the chronology that would be followed. The procedure envisaged by clause 9 is that there will be a single hearing of the dismissal case at which the issue of whether the dismissal was unfair and whether a third party induced it will be considered. But in our belief it is unnecessary and unhelpful to try to build in artificial distinctions about what evidence a tribunal may or may not receive. This can be left to the good sense of tribunals themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that the effect of clause 9 is to enable the tribunal at one fell swoop to hear all the relevant issues. Under clause 9, we are concerned with whether the employer will be able to bring in the union and say to the tribunal "I admit I dismissed this chap. I only did it because my arm was twisted by the trade union, and justice requires that the tribunal should hear what I have to say about that". Then, after the tribunal has heard what the union has to say, it should make up its mind, first, whether there was an unfair dismissal, and, if so, whether it was brought about because the trade union in some respects twisted the employer's arm. If that is established, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1069">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1057</span>
tribunal ought to be able to decide the proportion of responsibility and award compensation accordingly. That is the theme and purpose of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there has to be a claim for unfair dismissal. Second, the employer admits the dismissal but considers that he was forced to effect it. Third, the employer claims that he was induced by the trade union to do it because the employee concerned was a non-union member. Fourth, the tribunal joins, if so advised. Fifth, the tribunal determined the unfair dismissal issue, with the assistance of the trade union—which can contest that if it wants to—and then, if, but only if, it finds unfair dismissal does it award compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tribunal next considers and determines whether the complaint of inducement is well founded, and lastly, it considers and determines whether to make a contribution order, the criterion being whether it would be just and equitable to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all those stages, once joinder has taken place, which is early on, it is open to the trade union to contest any evidence, to challenge it, to cross-examine it, to adduce evidence of its own and to make representations on its own behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman then moved to the applicability of the clause to individual workers as distinct from trade unions or their representatives. His anxiety was about what would happen if an employer, exercising his rights under this clause, sought to join a considerable number of individuals. The circumstances which the right hon. Gentleman put forward were that the union could say that the people being sued were acting contrary to its instructions. He cited the Langston case and asked whether this was practical where there were many hundreds of people in such a case as that where conduct had provoked a demonstration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause does not require an employer to join. It enables him to join. At the time of the Langston case, the 1971 Act was in force and that gave power to an employer to join upon much wider grounds than the present clause would do. The employer in that case did not join.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will always be for the employer to decide whether the totality of his interest would be served by making use of this power. Among those interests he will certainly want to consider the effect on his future industrial relations and whether he
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1058</span>
would have any practical opportunity or prospect of recovering any contribution in terms of money from an individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will perhaps be cases where an employer will decide that those interests would be served. On the other hand, we can see from the Langston case cited by the right hon. Gentleman that there will certainly be cases where the employer will say "Notwithstanding that I have this right, I do not think that on the whole my interests will be served by making use of it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point is that an injustice exists at the moment as the law stands and it ought to be open to an employer in the circumstances with which we are concerned to bring in as a co-defendant the union or, alternatively, the individual whom he says was really responsible for bringing about the employee's dismissal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case cited by the right hon. Gentleman, or in any similar circumstances, there would not be the ability to join. I do not say in the Langston case because, as I have explained, there was a wider ability to join under the 1971 Act than there will be under the clause. But the right hon. Gentleman put the case of workers saying'. We are not going to work with this chap. He is a thoroughly bad egg and his conduct is such that we are not prepared to work with him." That falls outside the jurisdiction of the clause. The clause is limited to a dismissal that has taken place on the ground of pressure exercised—this is new section 76A(1)(	<i>b</i>)—
	<br><blockquote><p>"because the employee was not a member of any trade union or of a particular trade union."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, bad egg qualities by themselves will not give rise to the ability to join in these circumstances and to seek a contribution. That is a rather important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next, the right hon. Gentleman asked what happens when someone refuses to pay. He is joined and the tribunal says "Yes, it is a true bill and you had a part in this. We say that you must pay 40 per cent." The right hon. Gentleman says that the law must depend upon consent. I agree with that general proposition, but support for it does not warrant Parliament acquiescing in the continuance of a blatant injustice. I shall not weary the Committee by stating again the nature of the injustice. It is right for Parliament to confer a power—an ability—on an employer in these circumstances to seek a contribution order. He
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1070">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1059</span>
will doubtless be greatly influenced by the real prospects of his being able to recover anything worthwhile from, for example, any individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the important point is that the power should be there, Parliament must not be deflected by the fact that there will be some who, notwithstanding that they had a substantial part in what has been found to be an unfair dismissal, might conceivably defy the order of a court, from making an amendment to the law that fills this gap and remedies the injustice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fortunately, we live in an extremely law-respecting country. I say again that the trade unions are historically a law-abiding and a law-respecting body of organisations. Our fellow-citizens are respecters of the law. If those exist who, regrettably, would defy the order of the court, the processes of the court in enforcement for contempt must ultimately be allowed to take their course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must not shy away from the disagreeable consequences of an extreme case, and a rare case, of defiance of the court's orders. To do that in every case would be to abdicate our responsibility to make just law. Nobody wants to see the orders of the court defied. Nobody believes that the orders of the court are likely to be defied. Certainly, nobody wants to see penal enforcement provisions taking effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman points to section 63 of the 1978 Act and asks whether there is an inconsistency here because the very instances of pressure which are there recited and which are reflected in this clause are, in the 1978 Act, said to be disregarded when one is considering the question whether the dismissal is unfair. Yet, says the right hon. Gentleman, lo and behold, the same instances of pressure are set out in the clause and evidence of these is to found a claim for joinder against a trade union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is inconsistency because we are considering two separate matters, In the 1978 Act, and indeed in the 1975 Act as well, in the parallel provision, what was was being considered was the evidence whether or not a dismissal was to be regarded as unfair. In the 1978 Act Parliament was saying that if an employer dismissed someone he could not put up as an excuse or as a defence to the worker who had been sacked that he had been made to do so by the union. In other words, the employer cannot say "I agree that I sacked you. I agree that you are a good
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1060</span>
worker and I have no complaint against you personally, but I was obliged to do this by the trade union and therefore that makes your dismissal fair." That is what Parliament is saying there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we are talking about a different issue. We are talking about the grounds on which an employer may seek to join a trade union as a co-defendant to a claim for unfair dismissal compensation. The rights of the sacked worker are not affected by clause 9. The clause is concerned only with the right of the employer who is at the sharp end of a claim for unfair dismissal compensation to spread the load, so to speak, and to have the union brought in as a defendant to the claim in circumstances where that seems appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is therefore appropriate that the instances of pressure set out in section 63 should be capable of being taken into account. It is exactly that kind of pressure that has led the employer, against his wishes and better judgment, to dismiss a perfectly satisfactory worker. There is no inconsistency, and I hope that my remarks have cleared the matter. The same wording has been used merely for convenience, but there is inconsistency because two quite separate rights are involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press the hon. and learned Gentleman on this matter? He has not cleared up the doubt and confusion in my mind. Section 63 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In determining, for the purposes of this Part"</p></blockquote>
—this part is part V which relates to unfair dismissal and the right not be to unfairly dismissed—
	<br><blockquote><p>"In determining, for the purposes of this Part any question as to the reason, or principal reason, for which an employee was dismissed … no account shall be taken of any pressure which, by calling, organising, procuring or financing a strike"—</p></blockquote>
and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that that rules out these matters being involved, in the discretion of the tribunal, about the causes of the dismissal. Yet we see under clause 9 that in future the very factors that are apparently rules out by the 1978 Act can be instantly invoked for the purpose of the employer seeking joinder. If the factors are ruled out by the I978 Act, how can the employer now bring them in? It seems to me that the tribunal or the defendant can say that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1061</span>
1978 Act states that these matters may not be discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. and learned Gentleman has discussed the other amendments, perhaps he will return to this matter and tell me whether my misunderstanding lies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the right hon. Gentleman's invitation, but the answer lie I believe, in what the right hon. Gentleman has already said, that "this part" of the Act relates to unfair dismissal, whereas the clause with which we are concerned deals not with unfair dismissal principally but mainly with whether a union can be joined as having a shared responsibility. I have taken the point and I shall return to the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the right hon. Gentleman is pressing any of the other amendments. He has not advanced any arguments for them, and I do not want to take up unnecessary time. In respect of amendment No. 124, its effect would be to import into the proposed joinder procedure a duty on the tribunal to determine whether an employer's claim under new section 76A(1) was well founded, and only in a case where the tribunal decided it was well founded could it require the person named to be joined in the main action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is quite unnecessary because it is an unrealistic and two-stage procedure. The tribunal cannot be expected to determine whether the claim the employer makes is justified without hearing all relevant evidence on the dismissal. If it hears this evidence, the amendment proposes that it will have to do so all over again to determine the main issue of whether or not the dismissal was unfair. This complication is unnecessary because the clause expressly provides that no order requiring a person to pay a contribution to the employer can be made unless (	<i>a</i>)the dismissal is found to be unfair, and (	<i>b</i>)the tribunal finds that the employer's claim under subsection (1)—that is to say, that he was induced by the union or other persons, by industrial pressure, to dismiss on grounds of nonmembership—was well founded. This is an unhelpful and unnecessary insertion of a second stage which would lead to duplication and to unnecessary protraction of the proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 70, in the name of the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith),
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1062</span>
would give to the dismissed employee who is bringing the dismissal complaint, as well as to the employer who is defending it, a right to join the union or other person whose pressure he claimed caused the dismissal. I can understand the ground for this amendment. It raises a more substantial issue of principle, but it would not, in the Government's view, be appropriate to confer the same right on the dismissed individual as upon the employer concerned, for the following reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, it is the employer who is ultimately responsible for the dismissal and who is in the best position to know what considerations led him to dismiss the worker. It is right therefore that he should meet the primary claim of unfair dismissal rather than any third party. If he believes and wishes to contend that his arm was twisted, the law should provide him with the opportunity to claim contribution, but so far as the employee himself is concerned it matters not who provides the compensation. All that he is concerned with, I suggest, is that he has been unfairly dismissed, that the tribunal has so found, and that he should be compensated according to law in consequence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The employee can get his full compensation from the employer, whatever be the amount of contribution ultimately held to be properly laid at the door of the union. If the employer is liable only for 20 per cent. the employee none the less can recover 100 per cent. and the employer is left to get the balance back from the union. The employee's rights are met, and it does not matter to him if the employer gets a contribution order or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, there are considerations that bear upon industrial relations which seem to me to be properly taken into account by an employer in these circumstances. A joinder claim can in certain circumstances give rise, or be thought to give rise, to disruption, and an employer may in the totality of his interests think that it is better not to proceed in an application for joinder. I think that he might appear to be prejudiced if the employee, without reference to the employer, was entitled to go against the union himself. Since he can get the whole of his compensation from his former employer, there appears to be no real reason why he should be given the right to proceed against the union, with possible consequential disruptive effects for the employer's industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1072">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1063</span>
Only a few respondents to our working papers, notably the Institute of Journalists and a small minority of the British Institute of Management, have sought an extension of the right to individual employees. Employers and other groups generally have not done so. Even groups which are critical in other respects of what they see to be the narrowness of the Bill's closed shop proposals have not supported such an extension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1971 Act's joinder provision, although broader in the ways that I have already mentioned, did not give the employee a right to join. Weight of opinion would support the reasons I have given for resisting such an extension, and a number of employers would clearly be concerned about the possible disruptive effects of giving individuals a right to join.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument based upon expediency is that employers will presumably only join when they want the union or other person joined to share any costs of the dismissal that they have caused. So it is presumed that they will make a judgment about whether or not it is in their best interests to join. Where they have joined, they will seek the money due. However, having joined, the employer may then have second thoughts, perhaps because the person joined is discovered not to have the resources to pay or because pursuit of the joinder action would cause industrial disruption. Under the Bill, the employer will have discretion to discontinue his claim, but he would not have that ability were the right to be conferred upon the individual worker with the possible consequences that I have mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to take so long over this, but we have four quite substantial amendments and I wanted particularly to deal with that tabled by the hon. Member for Rochdale because it gives rise to an important point of principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of amendment No. 122 is to provide that a person can be joined by an employer only with the permission of the tribunal. This must be resisted, because it is difficult to see what practical effect it would have. It is difficult to imagine the grounds on which a tribunal would refuse before the hearing of evidence in the case an employer's claim to join. If an employer says that he dismissed the man because of his non-membership of a union, the tribunal will not be in any position at that stage to refute such a claim. Once it has heard evidence from other parties,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1064</span>
including the union or other joined party, it will be able to decide whether or not the claim is founded and whether to allow or dismiss it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a note on the effect of section 63, which is that the pressure is to be disregarded for the specific purpose set out there—that is to say, in determing whether the dismissal was unfair. Having decided that issue, where the employer has joined, the tribunal will consider the issues arising under clause 9, where the industrial pressure is clearly relevant under the terms of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point that the right hon. Gentleman made. One reads in section 63 that
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purposes of this Part any question as to the reason, or principal reason, for which an employee was dismissed or any question whether the reason or principal reason for which an employee was dismissed was a reason fulfilling the requirements of section 57(1)(	<i>b</i>)or whether the employer acted reasonably"—</p></blockquote>
the examples of pressure which are there set out will be disregarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is that all of that is geared to the reasons why somebody was dismissed in the context of unfair dismissal, not in the context of the considerations set out in clause 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, on further reflection, I find that there is a flaw in that argument, I undertake to write to the right hon. Gentleman about it, but I am at present confident that there is no conflict and that there will be no inconsistency between clause 9 if it is eneacted and section 63. I hope that I may leave it at that for the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cyril Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to my amendment No. 70. With great respect, the Minister seems to have concentrated on the economic argument without the moral argument of the closed shop and the effect that that has on individuals being taken into account. I argued on an earlier clause on the closed shop issue, and it seems that this clause could act as a prevention rather than a cure in a closed shop situation if it were strengthened by my amendment. The greater part of the Minister's speech was taken up by the employer having this right and the employer doing this and that. I am concerned with the individual in the closed shop situation, as I said when we debated clause 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that as the law stands my amendment would not affect the amount
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1073">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1065</span>
of compensation payable to the individual who lost his job as a consequence of a closed shop. I understand that. But the amendment might just make a union think twice about whether it ought to move against an individual for dismissal in a closed shop if, as a consequence of doing so, it could be faced with paying a substantial part of the compensation due to that individual as a consequence of his dismissal. Therefore, I see my amendment not, unfortunately, as a cure for the closed shop but as a further attempt to make sure that if unions move against individuals in a closed shop situation they can be compelled to pay for part of the damage that they cause to that person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As clause 9 stands at present, the individual has no right to require the employer or the trade union to become a party to the compensation. He has no right to do so whatever. The decision whether the trade union is called upon to pay part of the compensation is for the tribunal, but the decision as to wheter the tribunal considers the matter at all is entirely taken by the employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said this morning, the odds are that most employers will not use this clause. They will be happy to settle for a quiet life. We are talking about maximum compensation of £10,000 anyway so if the trade union is made a party it may cost it £5,000, but certainly not more than £10,000. In the same way, it will not cost the employer much either, and for the few thousand pounds involved the employer is likely to take the view that it is better to pay the few thousand and have a quiet life rather than force the union to pay its share of the damage caused—damage I stress again, caused not to the employer but to the individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the clause as it stands, the individual has no right whatsoever in this situation. The only person with any rights is the employer. He can bring the union to court, and the court then decides whether the union should pay part of the compensation. My amendment seeks to say that the individual who loses his job as a consequence of the closed shop and therefore sues for compensation shall have the right—if the employer does not exercise it—to say that he wants the trade union brought to court because, in his view, the trade union helped to cause the damage for which compensation is being paid and should therefore pay towards it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1066</span>
I accept the Minister's view that this does not affect by one penny the amount of compensation that the individual receives, but it might make a union think twice if it had to pay the bill instead of the employer. That is the purpose of my amendment, and that side of the argument has not been dealt with at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary says he wants to make fair and just law and reminds us that we are a very law-abiding society. That is true, and I want it to stay that way. It is true because, broadly, the people to whom the law applies give consent to the law. We have to be careful that we do not ask the law to do things which it cannot do. If we do that, we bring it into disrepute. One cannot make people good by legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not every attempt at bringing the law into industrial relations has been happy. In the days of the Combination Acts, unions were completely illegal under our law for a quarter of a century. Some of us at demonstrations over the weekend met a large number of trade unionists who took the view that this Government were going over the old course again and doing something very similar to what their predecessors did in 1971. If that is what they are about, so be it. It will be a rough passage, but the trade unions are used to it and used to being illegal. We were once illegal but we survived.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even under the 1971 Act, when, as my right hon. Friend said, union funds were sequestrated—quite often being fined up to £100,000—the unions still survived. It led in those circumstances to some unions trying to hide their funds so that they could not be got at by the courts. The general opinion of the CBI was that the 1971 Act soured industrial relations and did more harm then good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in that context that I look at the matters before us today. The Minister said that the purpose here is to protect the employer against pressure because an employee was not a member of a trade union. He presupposes that this will apply only to closed shops. That need not necessarily be so. Who says this applies only to closed shops?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not, for a start.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Minister's confirmation, because I could envisage circumstances where we did not have a closed shop and where there were considerable numbers of non-unionists but we had what my right hon. Friend called a bad egg. I can think of one case where someone was alleged to be a child molester and people did not want to work with him. If that person was dismissed, it would not be because he was not a member of a trade union. It could be for another reason. A person can be a bad egg, and we need not go into the reasons why someone is considered obnoxious and why people are not willing to work with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary said that my right hon. Friend referred only or primarily to amendment No. 125. In fact, he was referring very largely to amendment No. 124 and this is paragraph (	<i>b</i>)—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the employer may require the person who he claims exercised the pressure"—</p></blockquote>
and we would like that to be deleted and substituted by
	<br><blockquote><p>"the tribunal shall determine whether the claim is well-founded and if it is so determined may require the person named to be joined"—</p></blockquote>
and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the employer know? Should he not be required to make a prima facie case to the tribunal that it was X who organised this spontaneous movement? My right hon. Friend talked about photography, suggesting that some employers might be taking photographs of their people taking part in trade union activity. He hoped that the Minister would not think that frivolous. It is not frivolous. I received this week from a constituent a copy of the GLC NALGO journal which contained photographs of people on the GLC roof photographing a demonstration taking place outside the building. It alleges that someone—it is thought that it was the police—was photographing the demonstration and recording it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday, I wrote to the Home Secretary asking on what authority that was done, what the incidence of that sort of behaviour is, and what justification there is for it. I shall be interested in the reply. Is it a common practice? Will workers be fingerprinted? When we want to find out whether they actually work in an establishment, shall we fingerprint and photograph them? If we go down that path, we shall not be far from a police State. But that is

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is going down a dangerous road. If we bring the law into that area, it will not be accepted.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must return to some of the hon. and learned Gentleman's points, and not least to what seems to be an awful muddle emerging from the relationship between section 63 of the 1978 Act and the provisions of this clause. The hon. and learned Gentleman suggested that the complaint of unfair dismissal and the question of the joinder would be two stages in a process, and that when the tribunal was considering the merits of a claim of unfair dismissal it would be conditioned and governed by the provisions of section 63 of the 1978 Act. I think that that is what he was suggesting. Only after the tribunal had determined the substantial merits of the issue and come to the question of against whom the award of compensation should be made—the joinder issue—would the provisions of clause 9 become relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may have put the argument crudely and paraphrased the hon. and learned Gentleman, but I think that that is essentially what he was suggesting. That goes right back to the purpose of our amendments and the argument that I advanced. At what stage will the trade union or the persons be notified and be given an opportunity to be involved in the discussion and determination of the claim before the tribunal? The employer may well not even think about the question of joining a party to help pay the compensation, or to pay all the compensation—that is what the clause provides for—until he realises that he has lost an action that he thought he would win. He may well go blithely to a tribunal on the strong assumption that he had an unbeatable case. Therefore, only when he has lost his argument before the tribunal on the issue of unfair dismissal does he think "Right. The chaps who compelled me to sack this bloke will be joined and they will have to pay their share of compensation."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it is too late then for the union or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1075">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1069</span>
the persons to present their argument, not as to why they should not be joined but as to why they should not be involved at all. That is what we are concerned about—that right from the start those who may well be joined should be given an opportunity to present their arguments and be fully involved in the deliberations of the tribunal. What the hon. and learned Gentleman has suggested would not meet the case. I wonder at what stage in the proceedings the tribunal will be prepared to accept a plea by the employer, the defendant, for a joinder? Does he have to make clear at the outset of the proceedings that he proposes, whether he is successful or not, in any case to join Mr. Smith or the AUEW or whoever it may be? At that stage, will those people be notified? They may well have no knowledge of the proceedings. Who writes to them saying, "It has been proposed that you will be named as a party in the proceedings before the tribunal in such-and-such a case; make any submissions that you wish to make now"? Will the conciliation chap go along and see him as is the normal procedure in allegations or complaints of unfair dismissal? Will they be involved in the whole procedure—not only the tribunal procedure—but all that is involved in dealing under our statutory procedures with a complaint of unfair dismissal?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some other remarks of the hon. and learned Gentleman caused me new misgivings. The question was raised in my mind as to who pays the cash. In the event of an award of compensation being made in circumstances where the tribunal allocates and apportions the share of compensation as between the employer and the trade union or the persons, who recovers it?

I got the impression from what the hon. and learned Gentleman said, contrary to what I had assumed previously, that the employer would pay and then recover from the other party, often the trade union. Is that so, or would it be for the tribunal to determine who should pay? Will it say, "We award £6,000 damages. We believe that the employer and the AUEW must share responsibility here. Therefore the AUEW—or Mr. Smith—must pay £3,000." Does the employer hand over a cheque for £3,000 so that the matter ends there? Or has he to write out a cheque for £6,000 and seek to recover the £3,000 from Mr. Smith or the union? The question had not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1070</span>
crossed my mind until the hon. and learned Gentleman sought to set aside our arguments about the problems that would arise from those who refused to pay when compensation was awarded against them with the need perhaps to get a court order or ruling that the person was in contempt of the tribunal or court. Obviously the hon. and learned Gentleman read what was in our minds when we envisaged these situations—that this is the road to martyrdom. The hon. and learned Gentleman knows as well as any of us that, unhappily, there are people just itching to use a copy of the Act to light the faggots beneath their feet so that, in their view, they may etch their names into the history book of the Labour movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to become involved in that argument. It is a scenario of which we are all too vividly aware. But I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will clear up these doubts. What he has said reinforced my conviction—perhaps we do not have the form of words absolutely right—that those who may be joined, whether a trade union, a person or persons, ought to have the fullest opportunity to present their case, to defend themselves and to be involved from the outset. It is not sufficient for the hon. and learned Gentleman to rest, as he did, on the rule of the tribunals that any person shall be entitled to appear. That is not sufficient. Persons concerned must be informed of the proceedings. Somebody must tell them that the tribunal is taking place. They must be given advance notice of the substance of the claim and the parties to it. They must be told that, if they wish, they shall have the opportunity to appear, give evidence, argue their case, be represented, and so on. It is no use their finding out afterwards when they get some order in the post informing them that a sum of damages has been awarded against them. If they complain, somebody can say "You could have appeared if you wanted to. All you had to do was to make some inquiries and we would have told you what rule 7 said." It is a bit late then, is it not? The chap should have been told before the whole proceedings started. Then he could go along and say that he was not there on that date, that he was with his aunt Nellie or whoever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough to say that the rules of procedure already cover the matter. I did not know about rule 7. I

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1071</span>
wonder if any other member of the Committee knew. If we do not know about it—and if I who am more involved with the functions and procedures of industrial tribunals than perhaps any other hon. Member in the House do not know about it—how can we expect the chaps working in the offices and factories to know about it? They do not know about rule 7. Somebody must tell them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is all that we are asking of the Government. It seems to me to be wholly reasonable to ask, and why they should resist us I do not know. I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will clear up these difficult points that seem to me to be muddying the whole scene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first deal with the points made by the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith). He says—and he is perfectly right—that in my remarks advising my hon. Friends to resist his amendment No. 70 I concentrated entirely on the economic significance of the amendment. He is right to say that because I was really pointing out that in money terms it mattered not to the employee whether he secured his compensation from the employer or from the trade union. The amount that he recovered would be the same in each case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that he was looking at the matter partly from the moral standpoint and partly from the point of view of the desirability of deterring trade unions from putting pressure on employers to get rid of people against whom they have no compliant, solely because they are not members of the trade union. I agree that those considerations arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not sure that there is a very strong moral case. If the law tells somebody who has regrettably been dismissed—I emphasised that I regard it as very regrettable—and that is the only complaint against him, that he may receive full compensation according to the statute from his employer in those circumstances, I do not consider that there is a great moral lapse in the legislation by virtue only of the fact that it does not permit him to take his action directly against the union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the employer is going bankrupt and is unable to pay, will not the position of the union then be of some interest to the dismissed employee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact that the employer
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1072</span>
would not be able to pay would not affect the employer's right to claim joinder against the trade union. Indeed, it would make it much more likely, I would suppose, that it would exercise him. If the truth of the matter is that the employer only got rid of the man because the union twisted his arm, then, if he is not able to pay himself, he will certainly—and if he does not the receiver will—wish to exercise the right to join the union as a defendant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point raised by the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) is extremely interesting. If the firm is about to go bankrupt, the employee will be dismissed anyway. Whether the actual dismissal was unfair or not, he would not be able to keep his job for very long. Would the Minister feel that in those circumstances the tribunal might take the view that the amount of compensation should be very small, since the employee would be entitled to redundancy benefit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All these matters are for tribunals to decide. When it comes to quantifying compensation, the tribunal looks to see what the real loss has been. These are questions to be decided on the facts and circumstances in the individual case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point made by the hon. Member for Rochdale was that his proposal would deter a trade union. I take the point that there could be a situation in which the union knows that an employer will never seek to join it because to do so might cause disruption in his industrial relations with the union. Those circumstances may be visualised, I agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore have to concede that there could be circumstances in which a union would be less ready to take this kind of pressurising action if it knew that it was at risk of being proceeded against by the individual worker. Against that, we have to balance the potential disruptive effect of this type of action. I say "potential" because I do not believe that it would necessarily follow. But there is a substantial potential here for considerable industrial disruption to the disadvantage of the firm and its workers as a whole, to say nothing of the employer himself. I would be open to the individual, for example, not to sue a union but to sue individual workers. One might then have a kind of running sore that could lead to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1077">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1073</span>
great disruption and bring harm to the firm itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I not say that that is necessarily decisive, but it is something that has to be taken into consideration when deciding how far this new jurisdiction should go. If it were the only means by which the dismissed worker could obtain compensation, I should go along with the hon Gentleman. should not be saying "No, the fear of possible industrial disruption should lead us to refuse him a right himself to claim against the union or against his fellow workers But that is not the case A worker may obtain 100 per cent. compensation against his employer, and under the law it will then be left to the employer to pursue his claim for whatever contribution has been laid down as appropriate by the tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is one of those issues which is not all white or all black but in which a judgment has to be made, and, influenced predominantly by the fact that the worker himself may obtain his full compensation from the employer, we believe that it is right that the clause as drafted should stand and that amendment No. 70 should be resisted
I turn now to the comments of the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker). I give him the assurance that it is recognised that the trade union or the individuals at the sharp end of a joinder case must be notified at the beginning. That is what will happen under the provisions of the clause and under the rules of the tribunals as they work now. This happens in a civil court under what is called the third party procedure, which is on all fours. If a defendant—for example, an employer—is served with a writ saying that he is being sued for damages because a complaint has been made against him that he has been in breach of his duty and he believes that the fault lies at least partly with somebody else, he notifies the court accordingly and the third party is then notified that he is being blamed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That procedure takes place at the outset of a case, and in the issue under discussion this procedure will take place under clause 9 at the outset of a case. So the union or the individuals concerned will have complete freedom to take part in the hearings on every aspect of the matter. This will include such questions as whether the dismissal was unfair, whether it relates to the question of pressure being
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1074</span>
brought to bear by the union, or who compensation should be paid. Right across the board the union has the power to take full part. It cannot be made to do so, but it has the ability to do so and it is notified at the beginning
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand why the right hon. Gentleman regards this as fundamentally important. It is fundamentally important and it will take place. All those requirements are met by the clause and by the tribunal rules of procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman asks whether the employer will pay in full and then recover from the union. I am advised—and I say so with relief—that I was correct when I gave that view to the Committee earlier. The claim is against the employer, and it is for the employer then to recover whatever proportion he is entitled to under the finding of the tribunal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Jolly good luck to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Jolly good luck to him, says the right hon. Gentleman. I agree that it is jolly bad luck on him at the moment that he has no means of recovering from those who are primarily responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point on which the right hon. Gentleman said he was confused concerned the relationship of section 63 of the 1978 Act to clause 9 of the Bill. I do not think that I shall help the Committee by repeating the point. We shall consider that matter, and if it turns out that there is doubt under the clause as drafted about the last moment when the employer could apply to join, we shall consider whether an amendment is required. I do not believe that there is confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether there was any opportunity for the employer to decide late in the day that he wanted to blame the trade union. I suppose that it is open to him to decide that late in the day. But, if so, he would have to persuade the tribunal that it was a proper case for a joinder. The tribunal would then adjourn the case and give the trade union the fullest opportunity to take part in the proceedings from the beginning and have a re-run if necessary. It would be most unusual for the tribunal to agree to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have dealt with all the matters raised in this debate. I am sorry to have taken so long, but these are technical and difficult points, and it is

better to take a little longer in order to make them clear.

	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 126, in page 11, line 6, leave out

To appreciate the full frightening implications of subsection (3) of the new section 76A, we need to consider the clause as a whole and return to clause 1 from which these penalties may flow. We are being asked to approve the proposal that if an employer who has dismissed an employee</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1076</span>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed:</i> No. 125, in page 10, line 35, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) Where any trade union or person is to be joined under subsection (1) above the tribunal shall afford such trade union or person the same opportunity as the employer to present to the tribunal arguments concerning the question whether the employer's dismissal of the complainant was unfair."—[	<i>Mr. Harold Walker.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 9, Noes 13.</p>
	<p>claims that he was induced to do so by pressure and the tribunal makes an award but finds the claim was well-founded, it has the power to order the alleged inducer to pay not merely a percentage or contribution towards the compensation awarded but the whole amount, and we are particularly concerned about this. It is a staggering proposal. It begins with the notion of inducement, not force or compulsion, and yet finishes with the possibility of someone—not the employer and someone who has not dismissed anyone—facing the liability to pay every penny of the compensation awarded although he has not dismissed anyone. This is what we are being asked to approve.</p>
	<p>May I draw an analogy from the criminal law? It appears that it would be</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1079">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1077</span>
	<p>like someone who had counselled and procured someone else to commit an offence being made liable to be penalised to the maximum while the person committing the crime was not penalised at all. That might make sense in very rare cases where the offender was a juvenile or mentally retarded, but those cases would be rare in criminal law. Cases where the employer or employing company was a juvenile or mentally retarded would be even more rare. In my view, it is difficult to justify the last few words of subsection (3). While we are opposed to the clause as a whole, we are particularly opposed to the danger brought about by those last few words.</p>
	<p>We need to refer to subsection (1) in order to appreciate how monstrous subsection (3) really is. Let us see what inducement we are talking about and what it is that can render people liable to be ordered to contribute the whole of the compensation. The inducement is brought about
	<br><blockquote><p>"by calling, organising, procuring or financing a strike or other industrial action, or by threatening to do so."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>So if a shop steward goes to an employer and says " If Mr. X does not join the union, I may have to advise my fellow shop stewards to recommend an overtime ban", at that point the shop steward is rendering himself liable to finish up paying thousands of pounds in compensation.</p>
	<p>Some frightening figures were mentioned earlier in this Committee; figures above £14,000 were being talked about. The shop steward, in doing a normal part of his duty, is putting himself in peril of the Bankruptcy Court. If this proposal is intended to improve industrial relations, which the Government assure us is what the Bill is about, it is an extremely strange way of doing it.</p>
	<p>It may be that the Government will rely on the words in the clause
	<br><blockquote><p>"just and equitable in the circumstances"</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>and perhaps they will argue that because those words are there, the extreme results to which I referred will not come about. I presume that any judicial or quasi-judicial body has to make its decisions on the basis of what is in the statute. If there is provision in the statute for the whole amount of the compensation to be paid by the person joined in the action, the tribunal, in determining what is just and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1078</span>
equitable, must start from the assumption that there are circumstances where it would be just and equitable to make that kind of order.</p>
	<p>The Government are asking Parliament to say that in some circumstances it would be just and equitable for the tribunal to order the person joined, whether a trade union or an individual, to repay to the employer the whole of the compensation which he had been ordered to pay. If those words are in the terminology of the statute itself, that must be one of the circumstances to which the tribunal is required to have regard. Therefore, the tribunal, whichever case is it adjudicating on, must ask itself "Is this one of those cases where Parliament wants us to order the whole of the compensation to be paid by the trade union or the person joined?". That is the position in which the tribunal is being placed. Yet let us all remember that it is the employer who has done the dismissing.</p>
	<p>The Donovan Report drew attention to this point in chapter 9:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the decision to dismiss is the employer's taken ultimately because he considers it to the advantage of his business."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>That is so. He may have been induced by a shop steward or someone saying '.We might possibly have to call an overtime ban if so and so does not join the union." But there will be other factors which are to the advantage of his business. The fact that he may be facing the risk of industrial action is just one of the factors which may lead him to dismiss a particular employee. Nothing can alter the fact that it is the employer who has made the decision.</p>
	<p>It is quite astonishing to suggest that there are circumstances in which it would be just and equitable to allow the employer to escape totally from the consequences of his decision to dismiss. Yet it appears that the Government think there are some circumstances in which that would be just and equitable. I hope they will tell us in due course what those circumstances might be.</p>
	<p>There are, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) pointed out in relation to our earlier amendments, very great difficulties inherent in attempting to implement this clause at all. Certainly those difficulties will apply in the case of subsection (3), where a trade union as a body is not involved in the affair at all. That will very often happen.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1080">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1079</span>
We have had a number of occasions during the course of this Committee when we have had to explain to right hon. and hon. Gentlemen on the Government Benches some of the facts of trade union life. This is one of those occasions.</p>
	<p>Usually, the trade union as a national organisation will not be involved in this kind of dispute. It will arise at the shop floor level. It is a fact that shop stewards, FOCs or works representatives—their names vary according to the industry—are usually reluctant to bring in the full-time official if the dispute can be settled there and then at shop floor level. The full-time officials are very busy men and, in the main, an action of the kind which we are contemplating will arise quite spontaneously within the factory, and the union head office and probably the union divisional office will know very little about it, if anything. It will be a spontaneous decision of the people working in the factory.</p>
	<p>There may be 1,000, 2,000 or 3,000 involved, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster pointed out. Are they all to be joined in the action? Is the tribunal then supposed to split the compensation 3,000 ways? Or, what is more sinister, is it to be left to the employer to single out one of those individuals to be joined in the action?. That is a dangerous possibility. It is open to considerable potential for victimisation. The employer is looking for a way in which to deal with a particular shop steward, for example, While all the shop stewards and all the employees may well have been involved in the action which he claims has induced him to dismiss the employee, there is nothing here which stops him from picking out that one individual and joining him in the action with the possibility that he may face a claim for £14,000 out of his own pocket. There is nothing in the clause to prevent the employer making a completely discriminatory selection of the persons to be joined in the action. That is very dangerous, indeed.</p>
	<p>The tribunal, so far as I can see, is required only to consider whether the employer's claim is well-founded. If it decides that the claim is well-founded, everything else flows from that. It does not appear to me that the tribunal will be allowed to take any judicial note of the circumstances to which I have just referred in which an employer deliberately discriminates against one of his shop stewards
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1080</span>
in order to get him into a position in which he may face a hefty claim for money out of his own pocket. I cannot see that the tribunal will have the right to say to the employer "You are wrong. You should have brought in all your employees or all your shop stewards. Why pick out Mr. A to be joined in this action?" There is no suggestion here that the tribunal will have that right.</p>
	<p>We have been told repeatedly that the Government really want to improve industrial relations. How on earth can they expect to do it in this way? If the Government want justice and equity, which they seek from the tribunal in the terms of subsection (3), one approach would be by severely limiting the amount of compensation that could be ordered to be paid by any one individual who had been joined in the action.</p>
	<p>We suggest an amount which is fairly modest. We object to the whole principle, but we feel that at least a limit should be placed on the liability of one individual. It would be quite inequitable for a trade union to be ordered to pay any more than half of the compensation awarded. It would be bad enough for the union to be ordered to pay that kind of money, because it would not be the union which had made the dismissal. But to suggest that the trade union should be ordered in any circumstances to meet the whole cost is monstrous.</p>
	<p>The subsection is a naked attempt to intimidate shop stewards, and we need to understand its real purpose. It attempts to scare them off from carrying out what is a normal part of a shop steward's duties, because of the peril of finishing up in the Bankruptcy Court. I strongly commend the amendment to the Committee.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that I did not hear the whole speech of my hon. Friend, though I heard most of it. Any impartial person would have come to the conclusion that the case was made out and that it was a powerful one. There is not much that I am competent to add to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I want to make a comment which I have made about other parts of the Bill, and which is perhaps more true of this clause than of any other part of the Bill. If this is enacted, the Government had better start recruiting some more personnel in the office of the Official Solicitor. They will need them to get chaps out of prison in the way that their predecessors needed

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1081</span>
the Official Solicitor to get the Pentonville Five out of prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Government are relying on the fact that we have a lower level of economic activity than we had at the time of the Pentonville Five. It is a level of activity which is being lowered everyday by the idiotic mismanagement of the country's economic resources by the Government. I know that the Government are banking on the fact that that lower activity will decrease militancy amongst workers to the extent that people will not come out again in support of a Pentonville Five. It is true, and it would be idle to blink the fact, that when unemployment rises and the threat of unemployment increases all the time as it is doing now, there is a reduction in militancy amongst workers throughout the country.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some things, however, which are cardinal crimes in the eyes of organised workers. As my hon. Friend has just said, using the bludgeon of financial penalties imposed by the law to intimidate shop stewards doing their duty, or to intimidate people from offering themselves for election as shop stewards, is the sort of action that will undoubtedly be classed as the cardinal crimes. I foresee that we shall have a repetition of the situations which have arisen in the past under different Governments when, by some stratagem, they have had to get themselves off the hook from the consequences of legislation which they have introduced with great fanfares of trumpets, great shouts of triumph and great hopes of achieving their ends, but which has turned out to be counterproductive.

Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) for the way in which he moved the amendment. I understand the way in which it was put, and I accept that the hon. Gentleman put the matter fairly and with conviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are we talking about? We are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1082</span>
talking about circumstances in which an employer becomes liable to compensate an employee for having sacked him, and sacked him in what circumstances? From clause 9, we see that the employee has been sacked because pressure has been put upon the employer
	<br><blockquote><p>"because the employee was not a member of any trade union or of a particular trade union."</p></blockquote>
We know that compensation will be payable to the employee if a closed shop agreement has already been made between the trade union and the employer. It is then fair to dismiss, and it will remain fair to dismiss when the Bill is on the statute book, provided that the safeguards have been applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should trade unions be held immune from contributing to the compensation which their pressure has made the employer primarily liable to pay? I do not see the Opposition's argument, and, to be fair to the hon. Member for Rotherham, I suggest that he does not see the argument, either, because the terms of his amendment are not that trade unions should not have to pay a contribution, but that such a contribution shall be limited to 50 per cent. I am grateful for that recognition, which I maintain shows a knowledge of the realities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received from the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) the whole hog view, that the union should not be made to pay anything in any circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I misunderstood him, and he is kind enough to dissent from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So it is common ground in the Committee, and valuable result of the clause and the debate, that there should be provision for joinder and that the trade unions should be liable to pay a reasonable proportion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1083</span>
Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) expressly disclaimed my suggestion that he dissented from the proposition that unions ought to contribute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikado</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. and learned Gentleman has got it wrong. Never mind. I shall put him right in a moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether they do or whether they do not, my hon. Friends and I believe that trade unions ought to be made to contribute at the request of the employer, if the tribunal thinks that it is just and equitable, where it has been their hand which in reality has caused the dismissal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) wound up his speech by saying that it was not the trade union which had carried out the dismissal. He said that this was a naked attempt to intimidate shop stewards from doing their proper job. All these cases are matters of degree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take the illustration with which the hon. Gentleman began, a shop steward tells his employer that if Mr. X does not join the union, he—the shop steward—will have to recommend to his members that they take industrial action. I think the hon. Gentleman mentioned an overtime ban. I should have thought that that must be right down at the very bottom of the scale. Speaking for myself, if that was all that was said, I very much doubt whether a tribunal would there find any ground for a contribution if the employer went away and sacked Mr. X straight away. This is a matter for the tribunals and this is my interpretation of it, but I doubt whether that will ever come within what is set out in new section 76A(1)(	<i>a</i>),
	<br><blockquote><p>"that he was induced to dismiss the complainant by pressure which a trade union … exercised on him by calling, organising, procuring or financing a strike or other industrial action, or by threatening to do so."</p></blockquote>
An employer cannot be so compliant that, at the first whiff of trouble, he rushes out and sacks somebody. I give my own interpretation of what would be reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, one can just as readily visualise much sterner pressure. At the opposite end of the scale, one can visualise a situation in which an employer is left with absolutely no choice between sacking Mr. X, on the one hand, and being closed down, perhaps for ever, on the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances—which would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1084</span>
be rare—would not that justify a 100 per cent. finding? There is no effective choice left. Here is Mr. X, a first-class employee; absolutely no complaint against him. He does not want to join a trade union. No closed shop agreement is made so the union has not managed to achieve that. "None the less," says the union, "although we have not been able to make an agreement with you, we will close you down, and to hell with the consequences, unless you get rid of Mr. X, or make him join."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Albeit a rare case, that seems to me one which would justify a 100 per cent. finding. Certainly it could not be one where justice or equity would be served by limiting the contribution that the union could be made to make to 50 per cent. How could that be right? Those are the terms of this amendment. If a trade union wishes to be able with impunity and in financial terms to exercise this sort of pressure on employers to get rid of a person unless he joins that union, let them make a closed shop agreement. After all, the guidelines that were appended to the so-called concordat in February of last year mentioned that it was better for union membership to be achieved by voluntary means rather than by force, and everybody today realises that that is right. So I do not agree with the hon. Member for Rotherham when he says that this is a naked attempt to intimidate shop stewards and to prevent them doing their proper job, and I hope that I have said enough to explain why
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What matters in each case is the degree of pressure that is exercised. The hon. Gentleman talks about a large number of individuals, all of whom take the view that—to use the right hon. Gentleman's phrase—Mr. X is a bad egg, and that unless he joins the union he ought to leave. It is open to an employer to single out one or two out of 100. I think it most unlikely that he would proceed in those circumstances, but it would be open to him to single out one or two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the evidence is that they are one or two out of 100, he will not be able to get from any tribunal an award that entitles him to recover 100 per cent.—or more than a very small percentage—from one out of 100 employees. It is a different matter, of course, if he singles out the organiser, or the prime mover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I invite the Committee to look at this from the other side and ask why in theory he should be denied that right. Whether
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1083">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1085</span>
he chooses to do it in practice is a very different matter. I think that in the circumstances which have been set forth, it is much more likely that the employer will wish to join the trade union rather than join an individual, or at any rate he will wish to join a union organiser behind whom the trade union can be expected to stand, rather than an individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I do not believe it would be right—and it would leave a glaring loophole if this clause were drafted on that basis—that individuals could not be made liable for their share of whatever pressure had been exerted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This proposal has absolutely nothing to do with the desire to weaken the trade union movement, as the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow evidently believes. It has absolutely nothing to do with that. What it has to do with is the desire to enable an employer whose finger on the trigger has been squeezed by the trade union standing behind him—whose hand has been forced—to go to the tribunal and say that the justice of the matter requires that the compensation should be paid wholly or in part by the union that pressurised him to get rid of a man whom he wanted all along to keep.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, I must advise my right hon. Friend and my hon. Friends to vote against this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for intervening again, and I will be very brief. I want to say two things. The first is that I am quite unconvinced by anything the hon. and learned Gentleman has said about it not being the object of the clause, and of the whole Bill, to weaken the trade union movement. That is the very purpose of the Bill, and the explanatory memorandum could have said that in one sentence and saved a lot of questions and a lot of paper. That is what the Bill is all about; it is all about that, and nothing else. That is its essential purpose, and no amount of ingenious, practised and polished advocacy by the hon. and learned Gentleman will convince anybody in the trade union movement that that is not the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other thing I wanted to say is that I am sorry that, quite uncharacteristically, the hon. and learned Gentleman yielded to the temptation during his earlier observations to do a lawyer's trick by trying to get a witness tied in knots. When I dissented from what he was saying about
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1086</span>
there being no responsibility on the trade unions and no obligation, all I was dissenting from was the proposition that that was what this amendment was about. The hon. and learned Gentleman was not speaking to the amendment. That was the source of my dissent, because the amendment was not about relieving the trade unions of their obligations but about partial relieving. It does not follow at all that because one tables an amendment to say that a chap is to have both arms chopped off, we would sooner he had one chopped off. It does not follow from that that one is in favour of having any arms chopped off at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know how the House proceeds and how Committees proceed, and we all know how minorities struggle to achieve a little sweetener somehow in the course of our proceedings. We all know that minorities are driven from one fall-back position to another, and this amendment represents a fall-back position and does not represent an acceptance by any of us of the principle. If we had accepted the principle, we would have voted for the Bill on Second Reading, we would not be opposing clause stand part, and we would be voting for the Bill on Third Reading. It is clear from our behaviour that we do not accept the principle, and it is no good the hon. and learned Gentleman trying to do a devious, tortuous piece of bent philosophising in order to pin on us a view which none of us holds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) for correcting the Minister's misunderstanding—if it was a genuine misunderstanding in the first place. The 	<i>Official Report</i> will show that when I moved the amendment, I made it clear that we were opposed to the whole clause, anyway. As my hon. Friend pointed out, if we can reduce the viciousness of it, it is our duty to try to do so. Lest there should be any lingering doubt in the Under-Secretary's mind, let him be quite certain that we are totally opposed to the whole principle set out in this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But we have stopped beating our wives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. Unfortunately, the Under-Secretary spent a deal of his
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1084">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1087</span>
time arguing about the principle of clause 9 instead of arguing against our amendment, which is designed to limit the damage which can be done to trade unions or individual trade unionists, or in certain circumstances to individual workers who are not necessarily trade unionists themselves. It could happen that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing in the clause that says that the person joined must necessarily be a trade unionist himself. Anyone from anywhere could go along and induce in the terms set out here. But, unfortunately, the Under-Secretary chose to argue his case for the clause itself. He did not show any good reason why it could be held proper to expose an individual honest workman to the danger of being either rendered bankrupt or being taken to the county court and having his goods and chattels taken off him in order to pay thousands of pounds of compensation merely because he suggested to the employer that certain industrial action might be taken if someone else did not join the union—not taking industrial action, but merely threatening to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister told us that he believed, in the circumstances which I had illustrated earlier in my speech, that an industrial tribunal would not award any compensation against the union or the workers, it is not really for the Under-Secretary to attempt to forecast what the tribunal would do in any of these circumstances. The tribunal is surely looking at not the kind of inducenmet which led to the employer taking the action but the result of the action which the employer has taken. Is that not the case? The tribunal is there to assess compensation and to apportion it on the basis of what has actually happened, not merely on the basis of the degree of inducement allegedly placed upon the employer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it would be helpful if I suggested to the hon. Gentleman why in my view that is not the case. What the tribunal has to look at is the totality of the matter. It has to consider whether there was any pressure exercised on the employer
	<br><blockquote><p>"by calling, organising, procuring or financing a strike"</p></blockquote>
and whether the reason was membership or non-membership of a trade union, and then to assess the matter. It must deal with the totality of the matter. That is why I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1088</span>
thought it would be helpful to say that, in my view, in the illustration given the tribunal would say that that was not enough. It would look at the whole thing and, having assessed what effect it had upon the mind of the employer, it would look at what it would be just and equitable to award, if anything, by way of a contribution on him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's intervention. That is his point of view. I am not so sure that it would necessarily be the view of the tribunal. I accept of course that the tribunal must act in a way which it considers just and equitable in the circumstances. But if, as the Minister says, the tribunal has to assess what contribution it orders against the person joined on the basis of how strong the inducement to the employer was, a great deal of time will be taken in calling innumerable witnesses, because in the very nature of things this matter will be disputed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, it will be in the interests of the employer to say "I had no possible alternative. My business would have been closed down. I should have gone bankrupt. Everything nasty that could possibly be imagined would have happened if I had not given to this inducement." On the other hand, it is in the interests of the union or individual employee joined to say "We did not really put very much pressure on at all. We just had a quiet word with him in his office. We did not bother to hold a meeting or take a secret ballot or anything like that. We just said that it might be a good idea if he were to let Mr. X know that he had better join the union or otherwise he might have to get rid of him, and that if he did not do so we might perhaps impose an overtime ban or a work to rule."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Between those two extremes, there would be innumerable arguments before the tribunal, and the tribunal would have great difficulty, if the Minister is right, in assessing how it should award the compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am inclined to think that the tribunal might take a simpler view and say that the employer had established that some pressure was put on him. "Does it really matter," the tribunal would say," whether it was the threat of an overtime ban or the threat of a strike? The pressure was put on him, anyway, and we accept that the employers claim is well-founded." That is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1085">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1089</span>
the only criterion that is used in the Bill—that it is "well-founded"—and therefore the tribunal will order these unfortunate trade unionists who have to work for that employer to pay him a large share of the compensation resulting from his action in dismissing the employee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am no more able to look into the crystal ball and decide what a tribunal will determine than the Minister is, but I say that the picture I have painted is no less realistic than the one he gave us. There can be no doubt that this provision creates enormous potential dangers for individual employees—not only for trade unions, which are often well able to look after themselves, but for individual workmen attempting to do their job as trade unionists. This puts them in quite unreasonable peril.

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 127, in page 11, line 7, after "indemnity", insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(5) For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that an act done by a trade union or other person for the purpose of persuading an employer to agree to pay a sum of money in consequence of an order under subsection (2) above:
	<ol>
	<li>shall not by virtue only of this section be regarded as an unlawful act or the use of unlawful means for the purpose of establishing liability in tort; and</li>
	<li>shall be regarded as connected with the employment or non-employment of the person who made the original complaint against the employer within the meaning of section 29 of the 1974 Act;</li></ol>
and any such agreement shall not be unlawful by virtue only of the provisions of this section."</p></blockquote>
This amendment is similar to one that I moved on clause 3, which so fascinated and enthralled the Committee. I trust that it will hold the Committee similarly spellbound.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1090</span>
	<p>should be ordered against the inducer, to suggest that there are circumstances in which that order may, as set out in the Bill, "constitute a complete indemnity"—circumstances in which one can visualise one employee being hauled out by the employer and taken before the tribunal and found to have induced the employer, possibly on behalf of his 10,000 fellow-employees, to get rid of some individual—and then to say that that man, because he induced the employer and put pressure on, is liable to pay the whole compensation of £14,000 or more—we have had these figures bandied around—is absolutely inequitable and should never go into any statute.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The committee divided:</i> Ayes 9, Noes 13.</p>
	<p>The amendment provides that, if a trade union should take action—for instance, by threatening a strike or by striking—to persuade the employer to repay to the union any sum paid as a contribution or indemnity under clause 9, that action shall not be regarded by the courts as an unlawful act for the purpose of establishing liability in tort. It provides further that the action shall be construed as connected with the employment or non-employment of the person who made the original complaint for the purposes of section 29 of the 1974 Act. As the Committee knows, that provides a definition of "trade dispute".</p>
	<p>The construction that I have referred to would therefore bring the sort of action that I have described within that definition. This is important, because the immunities from tort action provided by section 13 of the 1974 Act are limited to
	<br><blockquote><p>"an act done by a person in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>The object of the amendment is therefore
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1086">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1091</span>
twofold. First, I regard it—as the hon. and learned Gentleman will be delighted to hear—as a probing amendment. I want to find out from him whether the Government intend this sort of action to be a tortious act and therefore one which could bring in its wake an injunction or damages against a trade union or trade unionists. The amendment is linked, as was the previous amendment, to the tendency of the Court of Appeal to—if I may use a neutral term, because the hon. and learned Gentleman chided me for using the word "invent"—construct new torts.</p>
	<p>As the hon. and learned Gentleman knows, the commission of a tortious act in a trade dispute can have important consequences, because some of the immunities granted by section 13 of the 1974 Act are made dependent on the fact that no tort or unlawful act is committed. That is simply to say that if strikers carry out an act which is a tort or an unlawful act, they lose their immunity.</p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>Of course, section 13(1) has provided that certain actions are not actionable as torts, for instance, breaking contracts or interfering with contracts in the furtherance of trade disputes. What the Court of Appeal has been doing in recent years, and which is the reason why legislation has been passed, is to "discover" new torts which have been outside the then statutory immunities.</p>
	<p>Professor Wedderburn sets out the background in his pamphlet. He cites cases, and I do not think I need to go into details about them. The hon. and learned Gentleman is familiar, as the whole Committee area, with Rookes v. Barnard, where the tort of intimidation, in other words threatening to break a contract was, in effect, suddenly discovered; interference with contracts falling short of an actual breach, which was "discovered" in the case of Torquay Hotel v. Cousins; direct procurement of a breach of commercial contracts, because up to 1974 the statutory immunities only covered breaches of employment contracts.</p>
	<p>All these actions which the Court of Appeal held to be torts have now been met by section 13 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 as amended by the 1975 Act. But that is not the end of the matter. The obvious fear which trade unionists have is that this Bill will provide the courts with new ammunition to find
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1092</span>
yet more torts—torts which are not yet covered by statutory immunity.</p>
	<p>When I raised the point originally, the hon. and learned Gentleman rejected my arguments for four reasons. Perhaps I might go through those reasons very briefly.</p>
	<p>First the hon. and learned Gentleman said that it was very unlikely that the situation envisaged by the amendment to clause 3 would ever occur in practice. In fact, the action contemplated in this amendment may well occur. It may well occur frequently, because it is a total new statutory right, something that did not exist before and something to which, as my hon. Friend implied over and over again, trade unions will resent and may well endeavour to criticise by taking the only action available to them, which is industrial action. I shall be interested to hear what the hon. and learned Gentleman has to say about that.</p>
	<p>The second argument was that a strike that contravened the new statutory right would not be held to be illegal in the sense that it contravened the clause—in that case he was talking about clause 3 but I shall be interested to hear whether the. Government will take the same view about a strike or demand for repayment. They might consider that such a strike or demand would undermine the right created in clause 9 for the employer to get a contribution from the union to a far greater extent than strike action would undermine the right created by clause 3 to compensation for unfair exclusion from a union. I shall be interested to hear whether the Government consider such a strike or demand is contrary to the clause itself.</p>
	<p>The third argument of the hon. and learned Gentleman is that it is doubtful whether a breach of a statutory right can be regarded as unlawful means or unlawful acts for the purposes of establishing liability at all.</p>
	<p>In support of this contention, the Minister cited the case of Cory Lighterage v. Transport and General Workers Union. This was a case concerning actions by trade unionists in respect of unfair industrial practices under the Industrial Relations Act 1971. An employer tried to argue that these unfair industrial actions were outside the statutory immunity provided by the Act and were therefore actionable in torts.</p>
	<p>Interesting as that case is—and I under-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1087">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1093</span>
stand why the hon. and learned Gentleman cited it—it is doubtful whether it covers the matter I raised. There may be a difference in kind between the unfair industrial practices under the Industrial Relations Act 1971 and the present law. It is significant that this is the only case quoted, and I presume, therefore, that it is the only one the Minister's advisers could find. I do not criticise the hon. and learned Gentleman for that. It is, of course, a case that may not be followed in future.</p>
	<p>The Minister argued that the provision had not been included in earlier Acts, whereas I argue that the 1974 Act was an attempt by the court to create new torts—in other words, previous legislation has attempted to meet the problem to a certain extent. I put forward the amendment as an extension of the previous effort.</p>
	<p>I hope that I have made reasonably clear to the Committee the point of this legalistic amendment, and I shall be interested to hear the hon. and learned Gentleman's reply. Although it is a legalistic point, I submit that it goes to the very heart of the right of trade unions to take industrial action.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the amendment truly goes to the heart of the trade unions' right to take industrial action. I hoped that I had said enough in the course of the debate to indicate that the Government stood firmly by the right of trade unions to take all proper steps to further their prime purpose, which I had always thought to be the organising of members so that they might claim the advantages of collective bargaining power as distinct from the individual bargaining power which was all that they had if they were unorganised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not mean that the Government are driven to concede that any use of organised membership, or any use of collective bargaining power, shall be legitimate and shall be immune from the ordinary processes of civil law, which exists for the protection of other individuals, not necessarily organised into trade unions but none the less deserving of protection for their basic rights. I refer to the right, for example, of people to work as they wish without interference, or to carry on their businesses without interference. What has to be done is to seek to draw a line, or hold a balance, between the proper motives for trade unions that I have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1094</span>
indicated and the necessary protection of individual rights. It is impossible to draw a line with which everybody, from his or her differing standpoint, will agree. One can only do one's conscientious best, holding each objective as desirable and good in itself.

The hon. and learned Gentleman said that the provision struck at the root of the trade unions' right to take industrial action. What kind of industrial action is this? It is industrial action, the purpose of which is to override the order of the tribunal, which is that, in all the circumstances of the case, the trade union shall pay a contribution towards the compensation for unfair dismissal that, by reason of its pressure, the employer has become liable to pay for the dismissed worker. That is what the order of the tribunal is about. Whether it is an order that ought to be made depends upon which view the Committee takes of the merits of clause 9 and its motives as a whole. We shall not agree upon that, but let us assume that clause 9 finds its way on to the statute book. Then Parliament will have said that there shall be provision for a tribunal to make a contribution order in these circumstances.

If we look at the realities of the matter instead of at the form, let us see in what light one ought to regard action by a trade union such as the amendment supposes. The hon. and learned Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong. It is clearly this. The trade union says "You have passed this Act. The tribunal has made this order. I am obliged under the order to contribute 40 per cent. of the compensation. OK. Here it is. Now we want it back, and how shall we get it back if you do not wish to pay it? We shall put pressure upon you through industrial action. We shall black you or call our members out. We shall exert against you, the employer, exactly the same kind of pressure that we exerted against you to get rid of Mr. X. Notwithstanding that we have not managed to get a closed shop agreement out of you, we shall twist your arm just as hard to get the money back as we twisted it in the first place to make you get rid of Mr. X, with the consequence that we have been held liable by the tribunal to contribute to his unfair dismissal compensation."

That is the reality of the matter. I have too great a respect for the hon. and learned Gentleman to believe that he can seriously suppose that to forestall that sort of action

would be to strike at the rights of trade unions to take industrial action. It cannot be so. What it would do is to forestall the ability of a trade union immune from civil action to twist somebody's arm in order to override or circumvent the order of the tribunal. It therefore puts the matter in a totally different light. I think that it must be common ground, because that is the motive of the trade union's action.

The hon. and learned Gentleman asked me, and he is entitled to an answer, whether the Government wished to see such activity as he posits protected by immunity. The Government would be absurd to wish to see that sort of immunity existing when they had gone to the trouble of conferring upon an employer in these circumstances the right to claim and to receive a contribution. They would be mad to do so. Therefore, my answer must be that it is the sincere hope and intention of the Government that such conduct shall not be cloaked—protected—by immunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If we are to have declaratory statements purporting to avoid doubt, perhaps there is a greater case for saying that the law should be declared in the sense that immunity does not exist here. But it is always dangerous to single out a particular—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
