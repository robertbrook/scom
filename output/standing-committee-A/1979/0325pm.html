	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [this day],</i> No. 176, in page 14, line 36, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and in this subsection 'contract' means a contract existing at the time of the act done in respect of which liability is alleged".—[	<i>Mr. Arthur Davidson.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General (Sir Ian Percival)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not exactly certain which part of the sentence I had reached at the conclusion of this morning's sitting, but I remember that the point I was making was that, so far as I knew, there was no relevant decision of a court on the meaning of the word "compel". I was suggesting that one inference which may be drawn from that is that there has never been any difficulty over its application. I quite accept that that is not conclusive. I do not put it forward as such, but I think it probably is the reason here. Looking at these matters from a practical point of view—and I think that most right hon. and hon. Members know that despite all that is said about the courts, on the whole their approach is a practical one because they are dealing with practical matters—the advice I give the Committee is that the courts would adopt a practical approach to the word " compel". In so far as they had to put a meaning on it, would put on it the meaning I have advanced, i.e. that it means making someone do something he does not want to do by leaving him no practical alternative but to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An even more practical way of testing what I am saying is by reference to these provisions. It is to be remembered that they come into operation by an employer saying "I have a right of action. I accept that that right of action might be barred by clause 13, unless I can bring myself within the provisions of this clause, but I can bring myself within the provisions of this
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1534</span>
clause." In order to do that, he has to satisfy each of the tests about which I have advised the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us translate that into practical terms. Take an employer who is saying in a SLADE situation that this clause applies. Let us assume that on everything down to subsection (2) the court is already satisfied and the employer has next to deal with the requirement of the first part of subsection (2). He has to satisfy the court that what was being done was
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purpose of compelling workers to become members of a particular trade union".</p></blockquote>
In the SLADE situation one could start with a proposition about which there would be no argument, namely that the whole purpose of the action being taken was to get the artworkers to join SLADE. That would still however leave the question: was the purpose to "compel" them to join? I think this is the way that would be approached. One would ask the question: how were they trying to make them join or get them to join? Was it by persuading them or encouraging them, or inducing them? Of course not. It was by compelling them to join by leaving them with no practical alternative but to do so. That is how I think the court would approach the application of the first part of subsection (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I am wrong on this point and the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) is right, far from widening the application of the subsection that would narrow it. The way this subsection operates, as I have said, is that it will be the employer who wants to bring himself within the provisions of the clause. It will be he who has to satisfy the court that the purpose of the action of which he is complaining was to "compel" workers to join a particular union. If the meaning put on the word "compel" by the court is the meaning attributed to it by the hon. Member for Rotherham, the burden placed upon the employer would be that much higher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that those who are concerned about the operation of this clause from the industrial action side have nothing to fear from this difference of opinion about the meaning of the word. If the meaning of the word or the meaning to be given to it in proceedings is as I say, it still imposes a very substantial task upon the employer, because it will not be enough for him to show that the union in question
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1327">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1535</span>
was trying to get people to join by persuading, encouraging or inducing them. The burden will be on him to prove more than that. I have said what I think that burden would be. If I am wrong, and the meaning to be attributed to the word is that given by the hon. Member for Rotherham, the burden on the employer is that much higher and the clause is that much narrower.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one other matter that I should like to mention while I am on my feet. I think I did less than justice to the point raised by the hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson). I should have said a little more than I did. I repeat what I said, that my advice to the Committee at this stage is that I do not think the danger which he foresaw and to which his amendment was directed would in practice arise. That remains my advice, but I should have added that the Department's lawyers will of course be studying what is said by everyone in this debate and particularly such matters of law as are put forward. If they advise me that there is more to it, the point made by the hon. and learned Member than I have said. or if on reconsideration I form that view, I shall speak to the hon. and learned Gentleman. At present my advice to the Committee is that the danger to which the amendment is directed would not arise in practice and therefore there would be no practical purpose in making the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. and learned Gentleman sits down, could he qualify the situation on two counts? First, it is said of SLADE—I do not wish to get involved in any arguments about SLADE or its tactics or policies—that some of the people whom it was seeking to persuade, induce or compel to join that organisation were self-employed. The Solicitor-General has throughout talked about the employer, but in this situation we could well be talking about self-employed people who were being sought by SLADE to join a particular section of the union. Would a self-employed individual have a right under clause 13 to take legal action against SLADE?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point, which I think it is important to have clarified, is if SLADE had said, instead of "We will take your work if you join our organisation. We won't touch your work at all because it is non-union work", would that have meant
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1536</span>
that under the provisions of clause 13 that its action would have been acceptable as it was under the previous Act and as it would be under this Bill if and when it reaches the statute book?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two specific questions there. Let me say this first. I was making my point by reference, I hope I said, to SLADE-type actions rather than linking it to any specific set of facts. That is not my job. I was pointing out that in that sort of situation, where some would say there was compulsion and others would not agree—that was a question of fact—the employer, if he was able to satisfy the court that the action being taken in a SLADE-type action was for the purpose of compelling workers to join that union, he could bring himself within the provisions of this clause. If not, no; and it would be for him to bring himself within its terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was then asked about the self-employed. There are two comments I must make on that. I think I have an accurate note of what the hon. Gentleman said. He asked "Would the self-employed have a right under these provisions to bring proceedings?" With respect, that is the wrong approach. This clause does not give anyone a right to do anything. Before one comes to consider the effect of this clause and whether it has any relevance to the situation, one has first to establish that a particular person has a cause of action at common law. The clause makes no difference whatever to whether anybody has a cause of action at common law. So the first question for the self-employed in such a situation would be "Have we got a cause of action at common law?" If the answer was "Yes", that would start the sequence of events which could lead to litigation, which is what this is all about. If the answer is that he does not have a cause of action at common law, the clause will not give him the right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he takes action then, when he gets further along the line he must consider this clause. It is to be observed that the clause speaks only of compelling "workers". The meaning of the terms used in it are to be the same as those used in the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act. "Worker" does not include self-employed. In order to take advantage of the clause the person suing has to establish that the acts done have been for the purpose of compelling "workers" to join a union.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1328">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1537</span>
As "worker" there would not include self-employed a self-employed plaintiff could not bring himself within those words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I apologise for my apparent discourtesy in not being here at half-past Four? It was because of a telephone call.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Solicitor-General for dealing in his usual expert way with the point that I raised. I am still unconvinced that something which is compulsory can have degrees to it. But if the hon. and learned Gentleman's interpretation is right and he says that it will be interpreted as meaning "leaving no practicable alternative", he is right in saying that this still imposes a heavy burden on the plaintiff, and we shall see what the courts decide about that. But I can foresee bonanzas arising in the courts as they listen to arguments from learned counsel on each side about what is a "practicable alternative" to joining the trade union; whether, for example, accepting dismissal from one's employment is a practicable alternative. This is a matter which can lead to considerable arguments. Nevertheless, the Solicitor-General has given his interpretation; we shall see in due course whether he is right. I am grateful to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther), I do not think that the hon. and learned Gentleman—and I add my thanks to those that have been expressed for the time and trouble that he has taken to assist us today—gave complete or satisfactory. much less convincing answers to the questions asked this morning by my hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) and my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question put by my hon. Friend the Member for Newton this morning was based on his experience in the shipyards. He postulated a situation in which employees of a construction company in a shipyard blacked and refused to handle parts or components delivered to that shipyard from a manufacturer on the ground that they had been made by or worked on by non-union labour. My hon. Friend asked which of the employers had the cause of action under the clause. Is it the contractor or the sub-contractor? Is it the constructor who is the purchaser of the parts or components? The hon. and learned Gentleman said that nothing can happen until some-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1538</span>
body takes action; but, with respect, that is an answer to a different question from the one put to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand the purport of the question put to him by my hon. Friend, it is this: which of the two employers is likely to be able successfully to pursue an action? That is what we were trying to find out. if the hon. and learned Gentleman is saying that neither of them is given any advantage by the clause in pursuing an action, that will make a valuable addition to the record. But in that case, with my lay mind, I am puzzled to know what it is all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I turn to the question about "compel". I do not think that the hon. and learned Gentleman has given any convincing reason why in subsection (1) the word " induced is used twice and "induce" once, and "compel" or "compelled" is not used, and in subsection (2) the word "compelling" is used. This is not a matter of great moment, because I do not think that there is any real difference between the two; in any common sense terms there is no great difference between the two. Perhaps what the hon. and learned Gentleman said about the fact that there had been no request to the courts to clarify is some evidence that there is no difference between the two. So you may ask why I bother.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason is that, as hon. Gentlemen know, right through the Bill I have sought to ensure that we are not providing windfall profits for learned gentlemen who practise at the Bar. The fact that there has been no attempt up till now to get the courts to interpret is no guarantee that it will not happen in the future. Some bright spark one day may ask " What was in the mind of Parliament when it used induce 'in subsection (1) and compel' in subsection (2)?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why do I think there is no difference between the two? Because I believe that the action taken in both cases will only be and can only be the use of words in one form or another. I do not know how else people will "compel" on a picket line. I have been on a few picket lines in my time. I have never seen either a thumbscrew or a rack on any of them; nor do I expect ever to see a thumbscrew or a rack on a picket line. The few specimens of those implements that remain are well locked up in the Tower of London and other museums, and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1329">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1539</span>
anyway are so corroded as to be beyond reasonable use. So what will this picket do to compel anyone?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will tell the hon. and learned Gentleman—although, when it comes to legal matters, I sit not merely at his feet but under them—in common sense the significance of "induce" and "compel" in the context of the clause. A, who is inducing B, says to B "If you do so-and-so, or fail to do so-and-so, the consequences for you will be such-and such" That is the inducement. That is the threat. That is the official or unofficial intimidation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is "compel"? What will the picket do under subsection (2)? He will say to B "If you do so-and-so, or do not do so-and-so, the consequences for you will be such-and-such." If the hon. and learned Gentleman thinks that the action that a picket will take under subsection (2) is different from that, will he please tell us in what way it is different, what instruments other than words the picket will use, where he is to get the instruments from and how he is to use them? If there is no instrument other than words, in any common sense interpretation there is no difference in practice between "induce" and "compel".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, I take the point—and I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for making it—that if "compel" meant something tougher, if it meant the thumbscrew or the rack, or some metaphorical equivalent of them, that would make life harder for the employer who was taking action. That is a very fair point, and I repeat that I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for making it, but I do not think it is a point of substance because I do not think that there can conceivably be any difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat the question. "Inducement" means the use of words. "Compelling" means, as I see it, the use of words. If the hon. and learned Gentleman thinks it means anything else, perhaps he will tell us what that anything else is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my hon. Friend will allow me to put a point to him in this connection. I am thinking particularly of the case of the lorry driver who arrives at the gates of a works, in Rotherham or elsewhere, and it turns out that he is not a trade union member. He is working for some other company, and he has come to deliver or collect some goods.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1540</span>
He is not a member of either the Transport and General Workers Union or the United Road Transport Union. So the people working at that factory—and I could name a factory in Rotherham where this would undoubtedly happen—would say " Sorry, you're not bringing that lorry into our works, because we are all trade unionists and we expect anyone who comes here on business to be a trade unionist, so therefore you cannot come in."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that point, they are inducing that man to break his contract of employment with his own employer, under which he is supposed to go in, and in the process of doing so he is causing his employer to break his commercial contract with the firm to which he is delivering. So quite clearly at that point, the factory workers are in danger of falling foul of clause 15. There is no question about that. They would not be in breach of clause 14 if there were a dispute taking place and they were picketing, because the company employing the lorry driver is clearly a first customer or first supplier. They would be in breach for picketing but not in breach under the working paper if they simply spoke to the man as he came in the gate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be some distinction here between a picket line in front of the gate and someone who is actually talking to somebody other than on a picket line. The first customer, first supplier " rule would be all right under the working paper, but where there is no dispute taking place and the case is simply that the workers do not want non-trade unionists in the factory, then clearly they will fall foul of clause 15.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether my hon. Friend would consider his point about there being no distinction between inducement and compulsion here. The workers are quite clearly inducing the lorry driver to break his contract of employment. If he went away immediately, joined the union and then came back, they would say "That's fine; you're OK now, you can come in." So there is an implicit inducement to him to join the union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Could that really be said to be compulsion to join the union? It all depends on what his own employer's attitude is. If his own employer says "Right, you're going to have to join the union now, because I must get my goods through that gate, and if they won't let you through without being a union member, I will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1330">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1541</span>
have to sack you if you don't join the union", that is presumably compulsion within the interpretation of the Solicitor-General. It would be arguable whether that is a practical alternative or not, but at least at that point it could be held—and I think my hon. and learned Friend may agree—that there is an element of compulsion, at least on the Solicitor-General's interpretation. But unless the driver's employer is taking that firm line, unless his employer is saying " Look, you have to join the union in order to get my goods into,that factory over there, because the employees there will not let you in otherwise", the matter is different. If the employer is prepared to say "Not to worry, I'll send another lorry driver who is a member of the union", no compulsion can possibly have arisen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. My hon. Friend as always, by his intervention, has thrown a clear light on the problems before us, and the last part of his observations were the most weighty part. The factory workers say "You're not coming in here with your lorry because you're not a union member." So if the driver cannot deliver the goods, he is breaking a contract. They are inducing him to break the contract. They are compelling him to break the contract. What is the difference? I cannot see any difference there. Of course, there are some measures they could use which would amount to compulsion, but those measures would fall foul of the law as it is now and would represent breaches of public order, as we have seen in the case of some pickets. But short of breaking the law as it is now, what instrument can the picket use, other than words, that creates a difference between "induce" and "compel"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find myself rather in the middle here on the question of interpretation. One hon. Gentleman is saying that there is no difference between inducing and compelling, and another is saying that "compelling" would be given an even tighter interpretation than I gave it. Both hon. Gentlemen will know that I can do no more than advise the Committee what I think, in the light of my experience in the courts, would be the approach of the courts. I think that that approach would be as I have said, because the courts will have to approach this as a practical matter, construing "compelling" in the context
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1542</span>
in which it appears. I do not think it could bear the meaning that the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) put on it in that context because there are no means which would not, as the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) said, themselves be unlawful, which could be used for compelling in the sense in which the hon. Member for Rotherham used the word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the courts would be practical about it, and that they would say that this meant more than persuading or inducing. I would not bet on the precise wording, but I should be very surprised if the interpretation was materially different from what I have advised the Committee. I have said from the start that I am only giving advice here on what I think would happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now let me turn to the practical examples put to me. I shall not pretend that I could follow every detail of each example and apply my mind to all the questions of law that would arise; I would be silly, and hon. Gentlemen would not think much of me if I tried to do that, but I can make certain general comments. For the very reasons that both hon. Gentlemen mentioned, this clause might well have no application in the situations that they were postulating, because the employer would not be able to produce any evidence which would enable him to satisfy the test which he has to satisfy, that the purpose of the acts was to compel workers to join a particular union. I think that for that reason, in the sort of situations—or most of them—that the hon. Gentlemen were postulating, nobody would even look at this clause, or whatever section it may turn out to be. The employer would say "That is not going to help me in these circumstances; I haven't a hope of proving on the evidence that this action was for the purpose of compelling somebody."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow spoke about what might happen on the picket line. What happened on the picket line is probably only known to the two people who were parties to the conversation. The employer is not likely to find himself in the situation—when something like this happens on the spur of the moment—of seeking to rely on this clause. There might be a situation where there had been a long course of action the purpose of which could be said to be to compel the lorry drivers who are coming to a certain factory to join a particular union by leaving them no practical alternative.

But the employer would have to prove that, and I think he would have great difficulty in any of the cases put to me. If he could prove that, he would satisfy one of the tests of subsection (2).

The question will also arise whether the lorry driver works at the same place of work as those who are taking the action to compel union membership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I specifically referred to a lorry driver who is not employed in a factory, but who is employed by someone else and who is coming in to deliver goods.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a tendency to refer to "the employer" without stating what employer we are talking about. Whenever I say "the employer" in this context. I mean the employer who has a cause of action at common law and wishes to pursue it, who would otherwise be defeated by clause 13, and who wants to pray in aid of this clause in order to get around that. In such a case he would have to satisfy the requirements of subsection (1), and he would then have to show that the action complained of, namely, stopping the lorry driver, was done
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purpose of compelling them to join a particular union".</p></blockquote>
It would be a matter of evidence whether he could prove it or not. On the particular facts put to me, I think he would have great difficulty, but in another case, where it went on over a long period of time, the evidence might be there. It would be for the employer, on each occasion, who wanted to take advantage of this clause, to demonstrate to the court that action had been taken which came within the provisions of subsection (1) and which had been taken for the purpose of compelling persons to join a particular union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move from that to the first question put to me by the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow. I wrote his question down, and I am sure he will forgive me if I quote it. He said that he wanted to know "which employer had the cause of action under this clause". How can I put it? If I am listening to someone talking in terms of engineering terminology, I may take a little while to get that right. This is not the right terminology. In deciding "which employer has a cause of action", one does not look at this clause at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1544</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One might have to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. With respect to the right hon. Gentleman, the employer does not look at this clause in order to determine whether he has a cause of action. Whether he has a cause of action—we are talking about inducing breach of commercial contract or inducing breach of contract of employment—does not depend on this at all. What has first to be decided, and the first thing on which he has to have advice, is whether he has a common law right of action, a cause of action. If he has not, that is the end of the matter. If he has, he must decide whether to bring the action. If he brings it, the defendant may set up as a defence "Yes, I did it, but it was done in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute" which, prima facie, is a complete defence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The employer faced with that—or his lawyer—has to ask himself, " Can we overcome that difficulty by praying in aid the provisions of this clause?" In order to answer that question—and I urge this upon hon. Members because there is no doubt about it—he, alone or with his lawyers, has to go through the check list of questions that I have postulated to the Committee. If he gets the right answers to those, he may take advantage of the provisions of this clause. If he does not, in no way can he do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the way in which this has to be approached. Whether anybody has a right of action to sue has nothing whatever to do with this clause. If they have one, so be it. The clause will help them to the extent that if the defendant would otherwise have a defence under clause 13 to that right of action, the plaintiff may be able to pray in aid this clause, provided lie can get within its terms. But if he does not have a cause of action at common law, there is nothing in these provisions that will give him one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the hon. and learned Gentleman—and I am extremely hesitant to enter the lists with him—I am bound to say to the Committee that what he says is wholly contrary to what the Government have so far been saying both inside and outside the House about the purpose of this provision in the Bill and is contrary to what the explanatory note that the Government have very helpfully put
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1332">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1545</span>
before the Committee. The note says about clause 15:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The clause provides that a person will be liable to civil action in the courts if he induces or threatens to induce an employee to break his contract of employment with the intention of compelling workers to join a particular trade union or one of two or more particular trade unions."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to qualify that by saying that this will not apply where the employee who is induced or who it is threatened will be induced to break his employment contract works for the same employer or at the same place as the workers who have been compelled to join a union. What the Secretary of State and his colleagues have been saying in the House and to the country is, first, that they understand the SLADE union to have behaved naughtily when it has said " We will instruct our chaps at the printing end of the business not to handle work coming in from outside sources unless it has been produced by our members. If it hasn't been produced by our members, we won't touch it unless they join our union." That is the whole thrust of the Government's argument; that is what they have argued all along. It is very different from what the Solicitor-General is saying to the Committee this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are entitled to know who is right. If the Solicitor-General is right, perhaps some of our worst anxieties and those of the trade union movement have been mitigated to that extent, but we really must know which version is right. I ought to be the last person to say this to the Solicitor-General, but I have had to say it about so many provisions of the Bill so far. There is, as we have learned from hard and bitter experience, an enormous gulf between what Ministers say in the House of Commons and in Committees of the House and how the courts interpret the letter of the law. That is what we are concerned with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Prior)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not a lawyer, and I would not just sit under the feet of the Solicitor-General; I should be buried six feet deep. As I understand it, first there would have to be a breach of contract. In the case that the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) was discussing earlier, it could have been a breach of a contract of employment with one employer or it could have been the inducement to a breach of a commercial contract by the other employer. In those circumstances, both
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1546</span>
employers might, under the hypothetical circumstances we are discussing, have had a right of action, but they would have had to prove that there was either a breach of the contract of employment by one or the inducement to a breach of a commercial contract by the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah! Light at last, Mr. Leadbitter. I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. I do not intend to disparage the Solicitor-General, but the right hon. Gentleman confirms what we had, until the Solicitor-General's intervention, assumed was the Government's intention. We all know what the Government are talking about and what their intention is, they have made it amply clear. Let us not mince words, they are concerned about the kind of action that SLADE is alleged to have participated in where a printing house employs SLADE members and the SLADE union says to its members there " Fellows, you really ought not to touch the stuff coming from Smith, Brown and Jones, an art studio or a photo-repro house or whatever, because the workers there are not members of any union." The Secretary of State now says that the clause would enable, first, in the event of that action occurring and the SLADE members in the print house refusing to handle the material, their employer to take action in the courts because they would then be in breach of their contract of employment. Secondly, because the art studio, photo-repro house or advertising agency has a contract to supply material, and they would then be inducing a breach of that contract, which would be a commercial contract, the employer in the outside agency where the material was being generated, would also have under this clause the right of action. At least we understand it now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those are the first steps, as my hon. and learned Friend has portrayed, in any action that might lie. It would then be a matter whether the other circumstances had been fulfilled in the way that he laid out in taking us through the clause this morning—whether the act was done
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purpose of compelling workers to become members of a particular trade union or of one of two or more particular trade unions",</p></blockquote>
and whether it was done for the same employer
	<br><blockquote><p>"if none of those workers works for the same employer or at the same place as the employee".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But we are entitled to ask the Secretary of State what is his intention. What does he want to happen? Presumably he has had this clause drafted to do something in certain circumstances. It has been our understanding and that of the trade union movement and the country generally that the Secretary of State intended certain things to happen in certain circumstances, either hypothetical or concrete and specific circumstances such as he would say that he and other people had had experience of. Is it his intention that if in those circumstances it could be construed that the Society of Lithographic Artists, Designers and Engravers had induced its members to break their contract of employment by refusing to handle that material, it should in future, unlike the present, be exposed to action in the courts? That, I understand, is his intention and that of the whole clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very important that we understand, first, what the Government's intention is. Only when we understand their intention can we show how it is misconceived and likely to have ill effects, not only in relation to the circumstances where the Secretary of State is seeking to provide remedial action, but in circumstances that he has perhaps not envisaged. As I said this morning, whilst the Secretary of State is following heaven knows how many precedents of previous Governments of seeing a situation where, whether rightly or wrongly, they believe that some action should be taken inadvertently or because of lack of foresight, they take action that has harmful consequences in other situations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) pointed out how this problem extends beyond the printing industry to the engineering industry. There are very many industries and industrial situations where there is that kind of relationship where an employer, who for one reason or another, puts work out or takes work in and where there is the same difficulty, where the workers in the establishment may well say "We aren't going to handle this material because it has not been produced by either trade unionists or by members of a particular trade union or trade unions."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may digress, notwithstanding the fact that the Solicitor-General corrected himself and said that in his earlier remarks he had been referring to SLADE-type actions, he did at one point actually say—I took down his words—that the whole
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1548</span>
purpose of SLADE's action was to "persuade or compel other workers to join their union "—that is, SLADE.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since I uttered some faint reproach about the recruitment tactics of SLADE in 1977, I have taken the trouble to acquaint myself with the problems confronting that union and its members and have had discussions with them. They have repeatedly insisted that, unlike some other unions, or a particular union, they had sought, contrary to what is being alleged, to be rather more tolerant by saying that a group of workers in a particular trade union could take the attitude about work coming in from outside that that work ought to be done by their members, particularly when they could see their own work disappearing and their jobs being at risk because of technological change. "That work ought to be done by our members and we aren't going to touch it unless it is done by our members, full stop."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Society of Lithographic Artists, Designers and Engravers has said, and it has incurred the Government's wrath—" That work ought to be done by our members whose jobs are jeopardised and threatened and therefore our members are not going to touch it. However, we are reasonable and sensible blokes and, if those blokes at the other end generating it want to join our union, we will look at that. If they join our union, that might be a different situation." It is that difference that has caused the problems at which, it seems to me, the Government are now tilting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is not only the Society of Lithographic Artists, Designers and Engravers. I want to ask the Solicitor-General a specific question. He said that the self-employed were not workers by legal definition so that therefore this clause did not impinge on them. Obviously, I must defer to his superior legal knowledge, but I beg him to look again, I should have thought that section 30, the general interpretation provisions, of the 1974 Act, brought the self-employed within the definition of "worker".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is very important for one of our later amendments, because clause 15(2), as has been pointed out, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This section applies to an act done for the purpose of compelling workers".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1334">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1549</span>
If the self-employed are within the legal definition of "workers", the self-employed come within the scope of the clause. We have an amendment on the Notice Paper—I am hesitant to trespass upon it, Mr. Leadbitter, but I must draw it to your attention—amendment No. 187, which is directed not only at the relevance of this clause to the employment of self-employed people, but to the relevance of self-employed people, not in the printing industry, but in the engineering and design industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will not have escaped the notice of the Committee that amendment No. 187 stands in my name, that of my hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Evans), and those of four other hon. Members who are—and they would be the first to expect me to say it—sponsored by the draughtsmen's union, TASS, because they are equally anxious about the consequences of this clause for their employment relationships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention that only to illustrate in specific terms that this matter goes way beyond the problems that the Secretary of State is seeking to tilt at in the printing industry. The Committee knows—I have said it so often—that I am a sponsored member of the A UEW engineering section. I know from personal experience that in the engineering industry we have exactly the same type of problem about work coming in from some outside source and a group of workers in a factory saying that they will not touch that because it has been produced either by non-trade union labour or by members of a union of which they disapprove for one reason or another and that they would be letting down their mates if they did it. Of course, the same thing would apply in a number of other industries. Therefore, I think that it is first of all important that we understand, despite what the Solicitor-General is saying about how the clause may be interpreted in legal terms, what the Government intend is the meaning of the clause shall be. Secondly, it is important to look not just at how the Solicitor-General will interpret it but at how the courts will interpret it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am bound to say to the hon. and learned Gentleman on the point that I put to him earlier today that supposing a trade union said that they were not touching the work because it ought to be done by their members, full stop, instead of saying that they would not touch it because the blokes that produced it were not members of their union. If it was the first of those alternat-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1550</span>
ives, the Solicitor-General said that he did not think that any action would arise under this. I am glad of that reassurance. I wonder, however, if that would be the case in the event of such a situation being the subject of litigation before the courts. let us suppose that the judge said to their trade union defendant in that situation "But, look, you are saying that your chaps would not touch this work just because it was not produced by your members. Supposing the chaps who did produce it were to apply to become members of your union, and supposing that they were qualified in terms of your rules to become members of your union. What would you say then?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder what would happen if the trade union official said, as he probably would be bound to do in those circumstances, "In that case, we should have to consider their applications for membership." If they became members of the union, what would happen? It seems to me that that would be a rather difficult situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have therefore, first of all, to understand what the Government's intention is and to look at how the courts might interpret the provisions of this clause. We also have to look at how far it goes beyond the specific situation that the Government have designed it to meet, including this problem of the self-employed. I think these are the issues on which we have a right to expect answers from the Solicitor-General. I would be the first to admit that he has been very helpful and I think has so far really earned his corn in the Committee. I am glad that he is obviously anxious—he is straining at the leash—to have a go at me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the advantages of being allowed to reply point by point is that one can remember all the points. It becomes more difficult, the more points there are, to remember, but if I miss any I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will remind me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will just say before I forget is that if I misquoted something about the facts of SLADE, I wish to apologise. It is no part of my case to misquote any facts. I would probably have done better to keep off the specific case. What I said was intended merely as an illustration of a point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the right hon. Gentleman's last point I think, if I followed rightly, that he was postulating a case where p ople wanted to join and the union was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1335">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1551</span>
not willing to admit them but was having to consider whether it would admit them. It seems to me to be the converse of what this clause is talking about. This clause is talking about the case where the union is trying to compel workers to join who 	<i>ex hypothesi</i> do not want to. If they did want to they would have to be compelled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I would, if I may, reply now to the main point that I think the right hon. Gentleman was putting, and in the same spirit in which he was putting it. My object in being here is to try to help to clarify the position. I think that this discussion is helping to clarify it because I think I see, as a result of the right hon. Gentleman's last intervention, some of the points that are in his mind, wrongly I think, but which I may help to clarify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no difference between the Government's intentions and my explanation of how this clause works. It is just that it is not easy either to explain it all in one or to take it all in one. It is no shame to any of us that it should take a little time to get to the heart of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I may perhaps marry up all these points by reference to a SLADE-type situation, because it is always easier to illustrate or to follow something by reference to actual bodies which one can picture. So let me take this much of a SLADE-type situation as my premise, SLADE, which has members employed by the printers, is able to ask those employees who are its members to black certain goods. With the co-operation of its members, albeit it is in breach of their contracts of employment, it can black those goods. So, let us suppose it says to its members working for a printer "We want you to black the goods passing between the printers and such and such a studio."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At common law—this is the first question that has to be asked in every instance—there may be three different causes of action there. The printer may have a cause of action for the inducing of a breach of contract of employment by his employees. The printer may also have a cause of action at common law for interference with the performance of his commercial contracts with the studio. The studio may have a cause of action for interference with its commercial contracts with the printers. That is the common law position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We move to the next stage: assuming
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1552</span>
that they have those common law rights of action, what could they do about it at the moment? The answer is "Nothing". SLADE has only to say that these acts were done in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, and provided it can establish the trade dispute—and that definition is very wide—that would be the end of the question because as the law stands, clearly it is entitled to immunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only difference that this clause will make is as follows. It does not give anybody any rights of action, but if this clause gets on to the statute book the Section 13 defence would not necessarily be the end of the matter. If either the printer or the studio, who on this hypothesis are assumed to have rights of action at common law, could satisfy all the requirements of this section, the barrier of section 13 which exists at the moment would be lifted, and those persons would be free to pursue their common law rights of action. That is the way it works. That has always been stated to be the Government's intention. It is to remove the barrier to action in those specific cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it all comes back in the end of this: it is not giving anybody any rights of action; it is saying to employers, who already have a common law right of action—because if they have not, they cannot sue, anyway—that if they can bring themselves within the terms of this section, the barrier to action is removed. They could do so only if they could on the particular facts of the case establish all these requirements, and in particular show that the action was taken for the purpose of
	<br><blockquote><p>"compelling workers to join a particular union".</p></blockquote>
There is no conflict between what the Government have been stating to be their intention and what I have been stating to be the effect of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Self-employed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. First of all, the person who is self-employed would have to ask what right of action he had at common law. It could well be that he would have difficulty in establishing a cause of action which came within section 13(1)(	<i>a</i>) or (	<i>b</i>), because that only refers to inducing a breach of contract or interfering with a contract, or threatening to induce a breach of contract or to interfere with a contract. That would clearly be the first difficulty to be faced by self-employed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1336">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1553</span>
persons who were seeking to sue in any of the circumstances we have been discussing or to which I am replying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the self-employed could not establish a cause of action, that would be the end of that. In the SLADE-type situation, their protection would come from the fact that the studio had a right to sue. If the studio sued and could bring itself within the terms of this new section, that would take the heat off those who were being compelled to join. That is the way it might work to assist the self-employed. The hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) will, I know, support me in saying that it is idle for a lawyer to talk in too general terms. In practice one has always to apply the law to the particular circumstances of the particular case in which one is asked to advise. If in a particular case somebody who came within the definition of self-employed was able to establish that he had a right of action at common law in the particular circumstances, the union would still have the section 13 defence in answer to that. If the act complained of was done in contemplation or furtherance, it would be for the self-employed person who was the plaintiff to bring himself within the provisions of this new section to avoid the section 13 defence. I can see that some self-employed might conceivably get within the definition of " worker ". I can see that that is arguable. But I say no more than that. In most cases, the self-employed would not be able to bring themselves within the definition of "worker" as that word is used in subsection (2) and, therefore, they would not be able to avail themselves of the benefits of this section.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Needham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my right hon. and learned Friend sits down, may I ask him—declaring my interest as a member of the SLADE art union, against my will—to clarify in my own mind how this proposal will work in practice, which is surely the important point? As I understood my right hon. and learned Friend, if the NGA were to black work coming from a studio purely on the basis that it was produced by non-union members and to go absolutely no further than that, there is nothing within this section that could be done about it, unless the NGA were to say that as well as blacking the work, the people producing it must also become members of the union. This is what the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1554</span>
SLADE union did, although the NGA union did not. From what my right hon. and learned Friend was saying, this provision must rely on the studio or the printer considering action under the common law. The practical difficulties of that are that the printer will do nothing against the NGA because it is his employees who are members of the union blacking the work, and the studio will do nothing against the NGA, either, because it is worried that, if it does, it will lose the work from the printer. It is reliant on the printer for giving it the work for its employees. Furthermore, if the studio uses self-employed people and then finds that it is itself being blacked by SLADE or the NGA, it will not use the self-employed artists, because if, it does, it will find that its work will not be accepted by the printer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seem to be going round in a complete circle. This section will not work unless the union demands that the people who are not union members actually join. Provided that the union only says that its members will not handle this work, it is perfectly entitled to do so. That may well be exactly what will happen. If that is what will happen, we will not have put right the wrong which is suffered by those—with great respect, like myself and my colleagues—who find themselves forced into a union with which they have absolutely nothing in common. Can my right hon. and learned Friend say whether I have got that right or wrong?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend asks if he has got that right. What is "that"? There were a dozen questions in what he said. If I were advising professionally on this, I would like to see all that written down, and I should then sit down with a bucket of ice, think the matter out and give my advice. If I did not do that I would be unwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yes, of course, there are difficulties. Given the chance, I could list as many difficulties again as have already been listed to me by hon. Members. Nobody claims that this clause will avoid all difficulties. We cannot do that. There may well be cases where the consequences are as he says. Again, one must go back to what I take as my starting point. We are seeking in this legislation not to give new rights at law but only to remove the bar which exists in section 13, which prevents people from exercising their common law rights in these particular circumstances. That is the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1337">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1555</span>
object of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has always been the case that it is up to the person who has the common law rights to decide whether to use them. I can think of a case where the studio—I think there was one case where the threat was very outspoken—was threatened with closure unless its employees joined SLADE. According to the Andrew Legatt report, I think, some of them were talking of banding together to take legal proceedings. But they were told "It is no good issuing a writ, because section 13 provides a complete defence to the action." Persons who had a common law right showed every indication of a willingness, a desire, to use it, and the only reason they did not use it in their own protection and the protection of those who worked for them was that section 13 prevented them from doing so. The practical effect of this section will be that instead of having to accept that advice, that there is nothing at all that can be done, their advisers would then be able to go on to consider whether they could take advantage of the provisions of this new section. Then the four questions I postulated would be asked, and if the answers to those were the appropriate ones, the opinion expressed by the lawyers would be "Yes, now you can go ahead with your common law right of action if you wish to do so."

So there in general terms is a situation in which this clause would make a practical difference and enable people who hitherto were not able to do so to use the rights which the common law gives them to protect themselves and others. But neither the Government nor I pretend that it will cover every situation which one might like to cover.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In some ways, it is a pity that we did not leave things as the Solicitor-General left them, which left matters fairly clear. Perhaps it is a pity that we have gone into these murky questions that have been raised and that we have allowed ourselves to discuss at some length the affairs of one union, SLADE. But as these matters have been raised, I should like to join in and ask a couple of questions, as an honest seeker after truth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The impression I get is that if a union, or workers, enter into a dispute, or take action in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, without seeking to compel anybody elsewhere to join a union, they retain
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1556</span>
the protection they had before. That would be permissible. It is only when they seek to compel people to join a union that they get into trouble
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give a couple of examples. Quite often a union will have an agreement with an employer to do certain work, and there could be a threat of somebody else poaching that work, from the union's point of view. I mention one case—perhaps it is one that the Solicitor-General knows of—the case of Health Computing Limited 	<i>versus</i> Meek, in which union officials had issued a circular informing members not to cooperate with a computer company which the union apprehended would poach work from computer personnel employed in the National Health Service. The argument in the case turned upon the question of whether a trade dispute existed. Counsel for the company argued that there had been no dispute, existing or contemplated but only—
	<br><blockquote><p>"groundless fears of remotely possible events".</p></blockquote>
In holding that the circular was distributed "in contemplation of" disputes between the union or its members on the one hand, and one or more health authorities on the other, Mr. Justice Goulding said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the circumstances it was reasonable to foresee that the enforcement of NALGO's policy of banning Health Computing from the health service might lead to disputes with employers, namely, the recalcitrant health authorities, and, on a fair application of the statutory language, the circular was distributed in contemplation of such disputes."</p></blockquote>
That is a view which plainly construes the statutory language as meaning that an act can contemplate a trade dispute which is not existing nor incipient in any sense apart from the possibility that disputes may develop if the union decides to press its point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So here is a case where some firm outside looked as though it would poach the work of workers within an authority, where they had an agreement with an employer. They took an action; they did not want to compel anybody to become a member of their union, and that was held to be perfectly lawful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Gentleman has just said it himself. He said they were not compelling anyone else to be a member of the union. In other words, if I have it right, the NALGO people within the Health Service were blacking the work
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1338">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1557</span>
which was being done, or sought to be done by this firm outside, but they were not saying—as would have to be the case under the provisions of this clause—" We are blacking your work because we are insisting that you join NALGO, and if you don't we will continue to black your work." In this case, they were not saying that. So I do not believe that such a case would be covered at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another point on which my right hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General might perhaps help me. Although I think my hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) was technically absolutely right in what he was saying, I understand—and this is one of the questions I have asked previously when discussing this clause—that if it is inferred or it is clear that the purpose of the action that was taken was to induce or compel people to join a particular union—or one, two or more particular unions—the inference in certain circumstances would be sufficient purpose for the courts to make a decision on. So the matter was not quite so cut and dried as my hon. Friend stated, and I think that we have just had an excellent illustration of the sort of problems that we could get into.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that; that is confirmation of what I understood the Solicitor-General said this morning, though I am not certain that it will give any satisfaction or comfort to the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham). What NALGO did there was to say "We will black the work of the firm." Full stop. End of story. No problem. What SLADE did was to say, in a similar situation "We would black people poaching our work", say Odham's Press or some firm like that. It did not go at it so abruptly. What it said to the studio was "We don't want to black you. We think the printing industry has problems; we should all be in it together, and if you like to come within the fraternity of the industry and the trade union movement, we will not black your work. We have sympathy for you as artists. You can form your own section; you can draw up your own rules; you can pay a smaller fee and so on, and your work will not be blacked." This was a number of years ago. Trade unions will not now take that understanding attitude and be hoist by their understanding petard. What they will do is what NALGO did. They will say "We black that work; this is our work,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1558</span>
and it is not the work of the outside firm." That work will be blacked, and there will be no legal penalty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman has described is the iron fist in the velvet glove, is it not? What he is now suggesting is that they will take off the velvet glove and say nothing. The real point is that if they wish people to join their union, that will become very clear from their general actions, no matter how they wrap them up, and provided that is their objective, the studio which is damaged will be protected by this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying anything of the sort, and the hon. Gentleman should be cautious about putting words into my mouth. I am not a member of that union. It will be for the union to decide. But clearly if it does what NALGO did, it will not be caught by this provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the example of the draughtsmen in TASS. They had a similar problem. Take the draughtsmen in firms such as Ford, British Aerospace, or Rolls-Royce. If there was a greater demand for draughtsmen's work, they did not say that it must all be done in plant. They were quite happy to allow it to be done outside, provided the people who did it outside did it under what they considered to be fair conditions. They were against self-employed people. This is the system of the lump—to which I think we are all opposed—in the building industry. It would be very similar in the case of draughtsmen, where they did not pay income tax, and so on. They were opposed to that, and they told these outside groups or firms that they should have certain minimum conditions, one of which was membership of a union at that time, and conditions relating to minimum hours, sickness pay and things of that sort. A federation of engineering design companies was set up—a sort of approved list. There were 301 outside that federation, which had 6,500 members. That is how they have operated in that industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an agency came along which was not trade union and sought to poach their work in a firm like Ford or British Aerospace, where the union has industrial strength, I think that the unions would say, as NALGO said, "That work is blacked. You are poaching our work, and we decline to touch it."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Needham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I answer the hon. Gentleman about SLADE, because it needs to be put on the record? I assure him that it was not a question of the mailed fist in the velvet glove, but of the mailed fist in the pit of the stomach. It was " You will join by such-and-such a date, or your work will no longer be done. You will not have a stamp and, therefore, it will be blacked." There was no question of being nice and charming to the studios concerned. It was sheer basic blackmail—" By such-and-such a date, if you are not joined, you will be bankrupted." We all had to join because we should have been bankrupted. That ought to be put on the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the question of inference, which my right hon. Friend mentioned. If, as the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) has just said, one of the conditions was membership of the union, when blacking takes place, whether by the NGA or by SLADE, clearly it must be done for some reason. How far does inference go? Would the court, for example, infer that the blacking was in furtherance of getting people into a union, although the union had not specifically stated that? If the court were to take that inference to that stage, my point in my case is covered. If, on the other hand, it were not to infer that, clearly, as the hon. Member for Newham, North-East said, the union would just say "We black the work and that is the end of it." The question of how far inference goes in the minds of the court is important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The courts will now have to construe this, but the explanation that we have had could not be clearer. Where a union has an agreement—in the Ford Motor Company, Odham's Press or anywhere else—with an employer, and an outside body wishes to poach that work, the union will presumably do as NALGO did and say " That work is now blacked. Full stop"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was asked about two questions. One was whether the courts would find something proved as a matter of inference. That is something with which the courts are very familiar. It is again a matter of common sense. One has to be able to go as far as to say something like, "We cannot specifically prove that the object was so and so, but
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1560</span>
it is apparent from the facts that there can have been no other purpose, and that is the only reasonable inference." That is something in which the courts are very experienced because it happens so often. One often can prove something not directly but only by inference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With respect to the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton), the significance of the Health Computing decision, if any, is in relation to what I call stage two—the setting up by the defendant of section 13. As he said, that case turned upon whether there was a trade dispute contemplation or furtherance of which the action in question could be taken. It has no bearing on this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other question that the hon. Gentleman put to me, it is a fact that in each case a person seeking to pray in aid this clause would have to prove, whether by direct evidence, as a matter of inference, or a combination of both, that the act complained of was done for the purposes of compelling workers to join a particular trade union—and not only that, but the rest of the subsection as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a fascinating debate. I thought that I understood the clause this morning. Then I read the explanatory notes and thought that I did not understand it. Then I listened to the Solicitor-General and was convinced that I had understood the clause. I then became confused again, and I am now in a state of limbo. In view of that, I should like to study the hon. and learned Gentleman's remarks. We should all do that before we make assertions about the true effects of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thought occurs to me as a result of what the Solicitor-General said. A danger to trade unionists is that the courts might well infer that a threat to black copy was made to compel union membership when it was not. That is a difficulty that trade unions would have to face. As the hon. and learned Gentleman readily confessed, it is a matter of inference for the courts, and the courts might well infer something which those threatening to black did not intend. With great respect to the hon. and learned Gentleman, who is very knowledgeable about these matters, it is not as simple as he says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not really all that difficult. One side—the studio which has been blacked—will put its case before the court in an affidavit and explain that it has been blacked because its members are not members of the union. If the union thinks that that is unfair, it has only to put its case before the court and the court can then consider it and decide—which it will do, after all, in an affidavit. It is not as though the court were acting in the dark, nor is there anything magical about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only that putting a case to the court involves great expense and time. It is true that the profession to which my hon. and learned Friend and I belong might well benefit from it. Certainly the unions will not. All that I intended was to withdraw my amendment. My amendment, incidentally, did not cover my point—I have now looked at it very carefully. It is totally defective. But I am grateful for the right hon. and learned Gentleman's response. I know that if the lawyers in the Department to which I once had the privilege of belonging look at it, they will do so thoroughly, and I am happy to accept his undertaking. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that the Solicitor-General has come to advise the Committee on the meaning of the clause and the interpretation of its several parts. Inevitably, the contributions on these other amendments will place us in exactly the same position as we have been in on the previous amendment. Because the clause itself is not operative unless an action takes place, it is difficult for any member of the Committee to avoid virtually a clause stand part debate in discussing an amendment. But I suggest that hon. Members, having had a good bite at the cherry on the first amendment, might consider the merit of avoiding repetition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ronald Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 181, in page 14, line 39, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"or of one or two or more particular trade unions".</p></blockquote>
Curiously, I was reassured to hear the Solicitor-General say this morning that this clause was "incomprehensible". I was grateful, because I found it so obscure and complex, and I thought it must only be me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1562</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did say incomprehensible unless seen in its context, but perfectly simply when put into its context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly it was incomprehensible to me before the right hon. and learned Gentleman put it into any context. I thought I was particularly slow-witted and that everyone else understood it, that it had crystal clarity to everyone else. I doubt whether we shall take so long on this amendment as we have on the others, although, knowing this Committee, I would never be surprised by anything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is really a probing amendment to find out what these words mean. They were not very clear to me. If I may say so, when the lion. and learned Gentleman made his presentation this morning, speaking in his deliberate way, the only sentence and language he had difficulty in wrapping his tongue round was the very phrase which we propose to leave out:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This section applies to an act done for the purpose of compelling workers to become members of a particular trade union or of one of two or more particular trade unions, if none of those workers works for the same employer or at the same place as the employee working under the contract of employment referred to in subsection (1) above."</p></blockquote>
That is not the easiest sentence to understand. I should particularly like to know what it really means when it speaks of compelling people to become members of
	<br><blockquote><p>a particular trade union or of one of two or more".</p></blockquote>
Does it mean compelling people to belong to several trade unions, or does it mean that one could join any trade union, one, for example, not affiliated to the TUC? The meaning is not immediately clear. My right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) asked what would happen on a building site if workers said they were not prepared to work with a certain individual because he was not a member of their trade union or a particular trade union, and he went away, came back, and said " I am a member of this other trade union." I think he said that would be all right. Certainly we should like this wording explained; that is why we have put down this probing amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say that after keeping comparatively still for a very long while,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1341">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1563</span>
I am dealing with this amendment. I congratulate hon. Gentlemen on what they have been able to dig out of this clause. It is very complicated. Without a legal training, it is extraordinarily hard to fathom it. I am very glad to have the Solicitor-General with me to help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of this amendment, as the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) has made clear, would be, first, to remove that piece which says
	<br><blockquote><p>"or of one of two or more particular trade unions".</p></blockquote>
That would leave
	<br><blockquote><p>"of a particular trade union".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the whole clause is to prevent what have become known as SLADE-type operations. I do not believe that there will be many more SLADE-type operations. I regret as much as anyone else that one has to have a complicated piece of legislation like this in order to ensure that there are not more SLADE-type operations. The purpose of the SLADE-type operation was to force people working for someone else at another place to join the SLADE union, or in certain circumstances for the NGA to force people to join the NGA, but they never pushed it quite as far as SLADE did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we have been seeking to do in the wording is to say that if one just had, as the amendment would now create, the requirement to become members of a particular trade union, it would be perfectly possible under those circumstances for SLADE or for any other union to say " All right, we are not going to insist that they become members of SLADE, but we are going to insist that they become members of SLADE, NGA or perhaps NATSOPA ". We believe that that would largely prevent the whole purpose of the clause, which is to say that the purpose is not to prevent one from becoming a member of a number of unions and therefore not in any way to try to prevent trade union membership, but that it is designed to stop, in cases of coercion, the pressures coming on to a person to join a particular union under the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman has suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We consider that the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"or of one of two or more particular trade unions"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1564</span>
cover this point; they do not stop a situation where union recruitment is for membership of a wide spread of trade unions, but they would stop a situation in which a union, if these words are not in, would be able to say " We can't have it just joining SLADE, but we can have it SLADE or NATSOPA or NGA ". It is for that reason that we believe that these words are necessary. If they were taken out, as the hon. Gentleman's amendment suggests, they would have that effect. I hope with that explanation, or anything else I can do to help him, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is hardly a deathless piece of prose and, as I am not particularly enamoured of the whole clause—it is not for me to seek to improve it—I should have thought that if after "members" we said "members of any trade union", it would perhaps have been clearer English. At least I understand now what the clause means. It was not very clear to me before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we said "members of any trade union", it would stop recruitment, because it would effectively say that no action could be taken in order to recruit trade union members. That is why we have to put in the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"of one of two or more particular trade unions ".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I agree with that, because it would then read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This section applies to an act done for the purpose of compelling workers to become members of any trade union ".</p></blockquote>
It is not for me to try to improve the language of this clause. I now understand what it means and, having elucidated that valuable information, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope to describe briefly our purpose in tabling these various amendments. I hope that if I am brief, it will not be taken as an indication of any lack of seriousness or importance that we attach to these very important amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first of these amendments proposes to insert words at the end of line 41. The clause says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if none of these workers work for the same employer or at the same place",</p></blockquote>
and we propose to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or is likely to do work at the same place as the employee",</p></blockquote>
and then it goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"working under the contract of employment referred to in subsection (1) above."</p></blockquote>
This is intended to preserve the freedom of workers to take industrial action in a situation where the employer might contract work out to a non-union firm and possibly one or more of that firm's men might be required to return with work to the firm that had sub-contracted the work. That would mean, as we understand the clause, that it may be wrong and unlawful for the workers in the firm which is sub-contracting to refuse to work with those non-unionists from the sub-contractor. Our amendment, if inserted, would preserve the freedom that they have at present to take industrial action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to amendment No. 178, which also seeks to insert into the same line the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or works for any employer who is an associated employer of that employee's employer".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1566</span>
Here we are seeking to exclude from the ambit of clause 15 situations where, for example, a subsidiary company sends work out to be done by another associated company, perhaps within the same group. The company receiving the work may not be organised by trade unions. It seems to us that if this provision is not inserted in the clause, the operation of the clause may well be arbitrary in the extreme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give a couple of examples. Let me take the A and B situation to which the Solicitor-General referred this morning. Workers at factory A may strike with the aim of organising into their union the workers at factory B. Where both A and B are associated companies or they are owned by the same parent company, the workers would not be liable, if our amendment was inserted. They may be in the absence of our amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the second example, A is owned by some other subsidiary, let us say X Ltd., and factory B is owned by subsidiary Y Ltd., which is in the same group. As the Bill stands at present the workers are liable, but would be protected if our amendment was inserted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 180 is aimed at safeguarding industrial action over undercutting issues. We understand, although we do not accept, what the Government are tilting at here. At least I think I understand, though I do not feel quite so sure as I did when we embarked on this clause this morning. I think the whole Committee recognises that very often industrial disputes are neither for a single purpose, nor can the particular purpose for which the industrial action has been undertaken be clearly defined. It may be a compound of issues, where recognition, trade union membership and undercutting are interwoven. Amendment No. 180 would safeguard the right to take industrial action over undercutting issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn finally to amendment No. 187—because No. 179 is purely consequential—which may be the most important in this group of amendments. I made some reference to it earlier, pointing out that it dealt specifically with the use of self-employed people in sub-contracting in draughting shops. Of course, it does not only apply there. Self-employed people may be used in a variety of sub-contracting situations in a wide number of industries. This amendment has been prompted by the draughtsmen's union, TASS, because it can see the problems the clause might
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1343">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1567</span>
pose for it and the way in which it might upset existing stable industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) referred to the Federation of Engineering and Design Companies. I want to refer to that organisation in just one minute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the sub-contracting draughting business, self-employed people have posed a variety of problems for a long time. The growth of self-employment in recent years has tended to upset stable industrial relationships. Very often the self-employed can offer their services for low rates of pay, often because they fail to meet their tax and national insurance obligations, and fail to work according to the recognised terms and conditions of employment, meaning that they do not have the same obligations to contribute to holiday pay, and so on. All of these were disruptive factors which tended to undermine the established pattern of collective bargaining and the terms and conditions of employment in the sub-contracting draughting industry. That industry was not unique in that respect. These problems arising from the use and abuse of self-employment have existed in a number of industries.

TASS was able to establish in April 1973 an agreement with the Federation of Engineering and Design Companies, covering a very large number of these subcontract shops, not to use self-employed people. As a consequence of that, subcontracting work has been able to be carried out between the member firms of the Federation, with the agreement of TASS, on a very harmonious basis and without any disruption of the arrangements or any industrial action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the great fear of TASS, having studied this clause very carefully, that it may expose that union and its members to action in court if they or their members refuse to handle work from sub-contractors who use self-employed people. The purpose of this amendment is to protect that situation, in the interests both of the sub-contracting companies and the union and its members, and not least to maintain the harmonious relationships which have been built up over the last seven years or so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again I stress that I hope the brevity of my remarks is not taken as some diminution of the importance of the amendments. We attach great importance to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Needham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the hon. Gentleman a question about amendment No. 117? The companies with which I am concerned work in the same building. One of the companies is a closed shop, and everybody is a member of the NGA. In the other one, which is an allied printing business, but in silk-screen printing, the employees are not members of the union. That is a perfectly democratic decision they have taken, basically because there is no union for silk-screen printers. Does this amendment mean that those who are in the NGA could decide to come out if they so wished, to force their colleagues not in the union in the same place of work to join the union, or does it mean that those who are not in the union could themselves go on strike in order to force those in the NGA to come out of the union? I think that amendment No. 177 might make things more complicated than they would be if left as they are under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to sound discouraging, but I think it is the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) who is making things more complicated. I am not quite sure how my amendment would bear on the situation that he has described. I accept that people in a work place, if they collectively wish not to belong to a union have the right; I accept that that is in the spirit of democracy. I hope that he will equally accept the right of other people who are organised. who pay their union contributions and who fulfil their union functions and so on to say that, by their collective action, by their organisation, they have improved their terms and conditions of employment and they are not going to allow other people to benefit as free riders or accept an obligation to work alongside with or even accept the work of non-trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister will accept their right to make such an assertion and to do that. It is in that spirit that my amendment is framed. The purpose of the amendment is to deal with that situation where, as I have said, in a shop which is well organised from a trade union point of view, work is sub-contracted and then the completed work returns from a non-union shop and is perhaps accompanied by a non-union worker from the non-union shop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not so unlikely. It is fairly common in the engineering industry for an engineering manufacturer to place a

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1569</span>
sub-contract outside and then for the work that has been sub-contracted to be installed by fitters or electricians and so on, from the outside firm and for the workers in the firm that sub-contracted the work to say, "We are not going to have that guy working with us" That is the purpose of my amendment, not, much as we dislike this clause, to wreck it but merely to safeguard that situation in the event of the clause being enacted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the way in which the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) has moved the amendment. I recognise that he moved it reasonably speedily, because we had a long debate on the previous amendment, and not at all because we believed that they were not important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am going to stick reasonably close to some notes on this. The intention of all these amendments is broadly to restrict the protection which the clause will otherwise give to workers faced with attempts to compel them to join a trade union. In drawing up the clause we paid particular and close attention to existing industrial relations practices and traditions. The clause is drafted as narrowly as possible to deal only with the coercive trade union recruitment as it was practised by SLADE.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could, of course, have drawn a clause which would have been much wider and caught many more people but we were particularly worried, for example—this will come up, or could do, I suspect, in this debate—about trade union practices on building sites and so on where one often cannot get a group of union members to work alongside non-union members. That is why we had to draw it up in the way that we did. It was with particular reference to workers working for the same employer or at the same place as the employee working under the contract of employment referred to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was why we did this. The clause deals with a specific abuse. It is therefore clear that any further limitation of protection which it affords—that is what these amendments amount to—means that there would be more scope for coercing people into trade unions. The clause does not make it unlawful for workers to refuse to work at the same place as someone who is not a union member. It does not make it unlawful for them to advise or warn their employer that they will not work with a non-member. This is the point of amend-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1570</span>
ment No. 177.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, however, no reason for them to take industrial action before they are called on to work with that non-member, simply because they think it likely that he will work at the same place. They can advise or warn in advance. They can take action if it actually happens. There is no need for anything further. So we believe that amendment No. 177 which deals with the word "likely" is unnecessary, that it is vaguely worded and that it could retain immunity for some unjustified industrial action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to amendments Nos. 179 and 178. There is no reason or need to treat the workers of an associated employer any differently from those of other employers. Workers of an associated employer who do not work at the same place as the employees taking the secondary action may have no connection with those employees other than the fact that their firms are linked through common ownership. The principle that workers should be compelled into union membership by secondary action by employees of another company must hold good whether or not the two companies are linked by ownership. My hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) has that problem I think in his own business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 180 deals with
	<br><blockquote><p>"an employer with whom the employer of the employee referred to in subsection (I) above has commercial contracts or other direct or indirect business relationship'.</p></blockquote>
This amendment drives a coach and horses through the whole clause, and I think that that is clearly apparent to hon. Members opposite. It is worth noting the behaviour against which the clause is designed to provide a remedy. SLADE's activities are objectionable precisely because they use the business relationship between firms to force workers to join a union against their will. It is only where a non-union firm does business with a unionised firm that the threat of blacking at the latter to compel union membership can be effective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is using the present tense.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1571</span>
still one or two cases. It is nothing like what it was, but I have heard of one example recently which is similar to that which went on before. On the whole it is better to use the past tense, though my remarks also relate to some slight degree to the present tense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
SLADE's tactics confronted artwork firms with a choice. Either they persuaded their workers, almost all of whom were opposed to SLADE, to join a union, or they lost most or all of their business, and faced bankruptcy because their work was blacked by SLADE members at printing firms. That was what it was all about. It was regrettable, and it is regrettable that we have to have this clause for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would allow those coercive recruitment tactics to continue unchecked, so it really goes to the heart of the whole clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now I come to an important amendment No. 187. This is the one which the right hon. Gentleman mentioned, which deals with TASS and the agreements that TASS made and the fair lists that TASS has in a number of places, operating as it does with the Federation of Engineering and Design Companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our view is that it will not interfere with the operation of fair lists, provided that the purpose of the fair list is not simply to force workers to join a trade union. The clause would not prevent industrial action by workers against their employer because he had contracted work—contracted work is important in this respect—to a firm or self-employed person that did not meet the requirements of the agreement. Only if the action was intended to compel such a firm's workers to join a union would it be unlawful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That amendment is therefore unnecessary in the case of the TASS-FEDC agreement, and disputes about non-membership of a union are unlikely to arise in the area covered by the agreement because the fair list system is well established and the design companies operate post-entry closed shops as a requirement of the agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Needham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to take my right hon. Friend back, but in answer to the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton), who asked which tense my right hon. Friend should be using, it is worth pointing out that on page 3 of the 	<i>Slade Journal</i> of 9th March 1980, a paragraph under the heading "Trade
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1572</span>
List Comeback" reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The National Council have endorsed proposals for the SLADE Trade List to be re-issued. It will be prepared in the same form as previously, and will be a general guide to establishments ' fair ' to SLADE in respect to conditions of employment and membership of all appropriate personnel.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Photo-Engraving, Litho, Photogravure, News Houses, Art and Photo Studios and Engravers will be included. Decisions about the future inclusion of SAU member firms will need to await clarification about the future of that Section."</p></blockquote>
The answer, I suggest to my right hon. Friend, is that the present tense is just as capable of being used as the past tense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not want to say any more, but I have been provoked by the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham). He seems to lack confidence in the Secretary of State's ability to answer my question. I was satisfied with his answer. The hon. Gentleman has now raised new material and is saying that SLADE takes the view that it will not accept copy from non-union sources. It is not seeking to compel anyone to belong to SLADE. It will do just as NALGO did and say, "That work is black", and all those who were worried about being compelled into that union need not worry at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After what the Secretary of State said in relation to TASS and the federation that he mentioned, the point is that to get on to that fair list people have to be members of a post-entry closed shop. So the Secretary of State is giving his blessing to the TASS arrangement, which requires people to belong to a trade union. That is the truth. The hon. Member for Chippenham need not worry about anyone being compelled into the union. They can stay outside the union. It is just that in these printing houses the unions will not accept that copy. He can rest on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can try to deal first with the point made by the hon. Member for Newham, North-East. He is trying to put words that have not been said into the mouths of all sorts of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly so far as he was stating that SLADE in future would merely say that it would not take any work from a non-union house and would not give as the reason that it was trying to coerce people into union membership, as I think we dealt with on the last amendment, if it could
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1346">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1573</span>
be inferred that that was the reason it was doing it, it would come up against this clause. I thought that was absolutely plain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the remarks about the present activities of SLADE, we have drawn this clause in a particular way to try to catch SLADE. I do not particularly care for the fair list system operated by TASS but I accept that it is an industrial practice, and one which I am not seeking to deal with in this clause or in any other clause of the Bill. I am trying to deal with the past activities and some of the present activities of SLADE.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do this because before the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) became a Member of this House, in the previous Parliament there was a good deal of debate, particularly with the right hon. Gentleman, who was the Minister of State at the time, on the activities of SLADE. There was widespread agreement across the Floor of the House that the activities of SLADE were totally undesirable in so far as they impinged upon people who did not wish to join a union, and who really were not suitable to join either SLADE or the SLADE art union. There was a difference on how to deal with this, but there was no difference between the two sides of the House on the fact that we did not care for the activities that were being practised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the 	<i>Official Report</i> for 29 June 1977 the hon. Gentleman will see that his right hon. Friend, while defending the right of the majority if they wished, to have a 100 per cent. closed shop, said that this must always be weighed against the views of dissenting individuals. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, to attempt through external pressure to impose closed shop agreements on establishments in which the great bulk of the work force does not wish to join the union in question, and still less to be subject to a closed shop agreement, is a different matter.—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 29 June 1977; Vol. 934, c. 478.]</p></blockquote>
That is precisely what we are seeking to avoid by this clause. I repeat that we have drawn this clause in this manner, which is perhaps difficult to understand, specifically to seek to avoid some of the normal industrial practices which are part of everyday industrial life, whether it be the TASS agreement or the agreements that operate on many large contractors' sites in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we can try and concentrate our minds on the SLADE aspects and if as well we can recognise that I hope—and we all
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1574</span>
hope—that the provisions of this clause will never have to be used, because it will only be used where coercive activities are imported, then perhaps just having the clause in the Bill will act as a sufficient disincentive to SLADE from pursuing the tactics it has pursued in the past. No one is denying it the right to recruit but I have always held the impression that one volunteer is worth a hell of a lot of conscripts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or to have a fair list? We are not seeking to abolish fair lists, although most of us have grave doubts about the operation of fair lists as they were being operated by SLADE, because they were part of the coercive activities.

I ask the Committee not to press these amendments. We believe that in some respects they would give much wider results than the clause. That would be wrong.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to keep the Committee for long, but we should not let the clause pass without comment, particularly on some of the remarks that have been made, not only today but previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thing that has characterised our proceedings today is the more restrained and moderate language from the Government Front Bench than that used either on the Floor of the House or on other occasions in reference to these matters. The Secretary of State quoted me, and I shall refer to that in a moment. But may I in turn quote what he said on Second Reading about the clause:
	<br><blockquote><p>SLADE had been prepared to bring companies to the brink of ruin in order to force their employees into union membership and to destroy the jobs of those who were unwilling to join. SLADE's activities brought that union almost universal condemnation—including from this Dispatch Box when the Labour Government were in office. The law must be changed to provide specific protection against such strong-arm tactics in case they are ever used again."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 December 1979; Vol. 976, cc. 67–68.]</p></blockquote>
I do not know whether the Government are learning or whether they are running</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1576</span>
	<p>requiring that the terms and conditions of employment in an area defined in that agreement require those working in that area to be employed on a contract of service.—[	<i>Mr. Harold Walker.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 8, Noes 11.</p>
	<p>out of steam, but we have had a different tone and more restrained and moderate language from the Government today. Nevertheless they persist in assuming that somehow the members of SLADE, unlike other trade unionists—I may say all other trade unionists—are fellows with forked tails and horns sprouting from their heads.</p>
	<p>I have taken the trouble, at the invitation of the society, to familiarise myself with the kind of work that it does and the problems that have faced it over the last few months. I find that these chaps are no different from the members of, say, NALGO, ASTMS, A UEW or, for that matter, the Law Society and Bar Council. They are the same kind of people. Perhaps. unlike the members of Law Society and the Bar Council, far from having a beneficial Government who put through legislation which is bound to line their pockets and increase their work load, these chaps find themselves with diminishing employment opportunities because of the impact of modern technology.</p>
	<p>The Secretary of State quoted from 	<i>Hansard.</i> I wish that he had quoted all my remarks when I pointed out that the actions of SLADE were understandable in the context of the effect of modern technology, microelectronics and the export of printing work abroad on its members' standard of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1348">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1577</span>
living and career prospects. We have to take the balance of these things.</p>
	<p>I have never pretended that all is well with the trade union world. I am not saying that we are the spokesmen for a band of angels. Of course there are matters that cause disquiet in the trade union world.</p>
	<p>6.43 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
	<p>6.55 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that SLADE members were no different from any other trade unionists. They have some of the weaknesses and defects that one finds in any collective group and its strengths and virtues as well. One has to see what some people have considered unacceptable be-haviour in the context of the problems which that union's members have had to face. I was saying that they were suffering from the impact of modern technology and changes of technique in the printing industry, which in many cases have de-prived them of work which has tradition- ally been theirs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter of great concern for the union—we certainly shall not develop it in this Committee, but it should be pursued elsewhere—is the loss of jobs because of the volume of printing work that could properly be done in this country but which for a variety of reasons is being done abroad. I have seen some of that work being done abroad, which ought to be done by SLADE members here. This is one of the feelings they have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was going to say that I am convinced that behaviour on the part of SLADE or anyone else will not be altered by laws. If I may digress for a moment, neither the Secretary of State nor Mr. Leggatt have recognised, as they ought to have done, that we had a subsequent debate in which SLADE was the subject of some comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that occasion I was able to read out the statement that had then been published or was about to be published in the 	<i>SLADE Journal</i> making it clear that the union, having regard to the comments that had been passed in the House and elsewhere, had decided to look again at the tactics that it had employed to preserve its interests. Neither Mr. Leggatt in his report nor the Secretary of State in his comments, either on the Floor of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1578</span>
House or in this Committee, have as much recognised that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the tactics, it seems extraordinary, in the light of the historical experience of the trade union movement and the weapon that it has used almost from its inception, that SLADE today should be singled out for particular criticism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it was on Thursday, that I was nostalgically looking back to the town in which my father worked as a journeyman felt hat maker. In those days it was almost the sole industry of that town. I can remember that every factory, whether a hat factory or not, had a plate displayed at the entrance to the works saying that no one would be admitted onto those premises unless he wore a felt hat. The shopkeepers refused to serve anyone unless he was wearing a felt hat. I can remember people being stoned in the streets because they were not wearing a felt hat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my mates left school at the age of 14 and found employment in the hatting industry, at the tender age of 14 they were given a trilby hat, or two of them, and told that they had to come to work every day in a trilby hat or they would not be admitted onto the premises. If that prevailed today, what would the Government do about it? They would pass a law against it as a restrictive practice, unfair coercion, inducement to breach of contract. Those tactics, as I understand it, were by no means exceptional. Every one were by no means exceptional.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every one of those felt hats, if manufactured in a trade union establishment, had inserted in the hat band a stamp. I believe the practice still persists to this day. If, Mr. Leadbitter, you were to go to purchase a felt hat in an Oxford Street store, I would urge you to look inside and turn down the hat band, you would almost certainly see a little stamp stuck inside to testify that it had been produced by trade union labour. A good trade unionist would have been urged not to buy a hat unless it had such a stamp in it. It is a practice that has persisted for many years. These practices are not new.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No matter what the Government and others may think about the past practices of SLADE—I have pointed out how its tactics have been modified—the right way to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1349">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1579</span>
change its behaviour is not by passing laws. I do not believe that will do it at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I believe that the clause will have far wider consequences, as we have illustrated, than the Government expect or intend it to have. In their belief that they will tackle a problem with this clause, they only create new problems in a whole variety of ways unenvisaged and unanticipated by them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, like many other provisions of the Bill, this will import into industrial relations legal complexities that, as we have seen illustrated today, are extremely difficult for the Solicitor-General to understand, too difficult for the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State to understand and more difficult still for me to understand. If we, who are dealing with these matters, find them difficult to understand, how much more difficult will they be for those who have no experience of this Committee and its work or of the law—the trade unions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall bring complicated law into industrial relations. I quoted from the Leggatt report, not from Hansard, where my remarks were no doubt paraphrased.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Walker, while expressing disquiet at SLADE's tactics, rejected the idea of legal intervention, hoped that good sense would prevail, and remarked that industrial problems cannot be solved without some give and take on both sides."</p></blockquote>
I believe that these problems are better dealt with by good sense and persuasion of either side, by give and take rather than by trying to pass coercive or oppressive laws. Above all, this will weaken the trade union movement, not merely by attacking the Society of Lithographic Artists, Designers and Engravers, but also by weakening other trade unions. I hope that for these reasons my hon. and right hon. Friends will join in voting against the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee long on this debate. but I should like to say a few words about it. I recognise that basically what a union like SLADE sought to do was to recruit. It had been losing members because of technology over the years and was seeking to get additional members. We did not object to its recruitment in any way, but to the tactics it used in the recruitment of those members. This is what it was all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have found, going round British Industry, particularly the printing industry, that the vast majority of the people in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1580</span>
SLADE whom I have met have been highly responsible individuals—sometimes a damned sight more responsible than some of the other unions. What we objected to strongly was the method that for a number of years they used to recruit. I say quite openly that if there is never cause for this clause to be used, it will have served its purpose extraordinarily well. I hope that that remains the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman is quite right; there was a debate in March 1979. It followed the statements made by SLADE in February 1979. He said that Mr. Leggatts report did not mention it, but did mention it in paragraph 40 of that report. This might be a suitable moment for me to pay a tribute to the work that Mr. Leggatt carried out. Some of the information contained in this document makes one's hair stand on end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recommend members of the Committee at some time to read paragraphs 150 to 154 about a Mr. David Thomas, when I think they will get some of the colour of what was going on. That is what we have sought to deal with in clause 15. It deals specifically with secondary action taken by employees of an employer at one place in order to compel workers of a different employer working at another place to join a particular trade union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, the clause seeks to tackle as precisely as possible the kind of blacking which SLADE organised against nonunion companies in the art and advertising industries. It does not go wider than that. It does not affect primary action about union membership, nor secondary action at another work place by the employees of the same employer as those in dispute. Nor, as I have said, does it make unlawful the practice of refusing to work with nonunion labour at the same site or work place. Only those who adopt the kind of tactics which SLADE used to compel workers into trade union membership will be affected by this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end by saying that SLADE did not change its spots until very close to the 1979 election. Undoubtedly, this was an issue at the last election. That is why we put this particular matter into our manifesto. Whilst we think it right to introduce this clause into the Bill, it has been difficult to draft, simply because we have taken every possible care to try to confine it to the activities of SLADE—I hope in the past, but if it behaves in the same way in the present it could be caught by it. It is on

	<section>
	<div class='title'>ENACTMENTS CEASING TO HAVE EFFECT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 29, in page 15, line 5, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>b</i>) in section 1(2) of the 1975 Act (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service), the words ' and in particular of encouraging the extension of collective bargaining and, where necessary, reform of collective bargaining machinery.'."</p></blockquote>
I can be very brief. This amendment is not intended to be an attack on ACAS—quite the contrary. I repeat this because sometimes the Opposition do not get the message. I desire in the amendment to see that ACAS fulfils the necessary role of being a service which will arbitrate, conciliate and advise. I believe that there are impediments to this in the remit which Parliament gave to ACAS when setting it up under the Employment Protection Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 16(	<i>b</i>) repeals the procedures for ACAS to follow when dealing with a recognition issue. My amendment will remove the obligation on ACAS to foster collective bargaining as a matter which it is required by legislation to do. There are three or four reasons why I believe this to be desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I believe that the provision within the Statute is controversial. Secondly, I believe that it conflicts with the need to put ACAS's objectivity beyond any question of doubt. I can easily envisage an employer,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1582</span>
	<p>of the Bill: —</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 12, Noes 9.</p>
	<p>perhaps not very well versed in the ways of ACAS and its procedures, perhaps never having come into contact with it before, asking " What is this organisation getting at? Will it push a trade union on to me when it will not suit my particular situation? "I can hear the employer say" I have heard that it has an obligation to insist, or to push as far as possible, that trade unions should be accepted wherever possible." I believe that this constitutes a blockage in the minds of people who might otherwise not only need but benefit from the services of ACAS.</p>
	<p>The other point which I believe is valid here is that if the Government believe that the means necessary are to be repealed, as is provided in clause 16(	<i>b</i>), surely the ends also ought to go. Therefore, I believe that we should remove both the sections which are down for removal and the preamble which goes right at the beginning of the Employment Protection Act.</p>
	<p>My final point is this. I cannot understand why ACAS should be required solely to foster collective bargaining. I am not suggesting that there is anything wrong with collective bargaining. Indeed. I accept, despite what Opposition hon. Members may say, that it performs a valuable and often necessary function. I also believe that there are situations in which face-to-face bargaining is appropriate and often preferred, not merely by management but by workers. This frequently happens in very small units rather than in large ones.</p>
	<p>If ACAS is almost prohibited by the statute from encouraging face-to-face bargaining when the merits of the situation require it, I believe that we should get rid of these words. So long as the words remain, some employers will treat ACAS as being suspect. Nothing does more harm to good industrial relations than having a body designed for conciliation and arbitration which is suspect.</p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1583</span>
	<p>I repeat that this is not an attack on ACAS but a desire to make it genuinely acceptable to all sections of industry and not merely some, as at present.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The words that my hon. Friends amendment would delete from section 1 (2) of the 1975 Act are important. I think that it is perfectly true that had we been creating the Employment Protection Act we should not have put those words in. During the Committee stage of that measure, as the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) knows quite well, we sought to take them out. We are worried that they would lead to a bias developing in ACAS, or not so much a bias as a feeling that there was a bias in ACAS, and that this would have the result of rendering ACAS less effective than it otherwise would be. At that time we were worrying about the statutory recognition procedures of sections 11 to 16. We shall come to those later on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we were consulting on the recognition sections for one of our consultative documents which came out in September, a number of representations were made to us about leaving in this part of section 1 (2). We answered that we felt that it was related to the statutory recognition provisions which we intended to repeal, but that from now on ACAS would in practice be able to help recognition only by voluntary means, and that therefore to that extent there was some value in keeping in those words. In so far as statutory recognition was repealed, the words could only have the meaning ascribed to them by voluntary recognition, and in so far as we needed to have voluntary recognition we ought to keep them in. That is the basis of our decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was one further decision. I have always said, and the Government have said, that we were trying to make limited but vital changes in this Bill. The Government thought that the important thing to do was to make the changes to sections 11 to 16, and that it was better to leave the ACAS terms of reference as they were. Under those circumstances, no one could accuse us of wishing in any way to change the growing importance and independence of ACAS and to disturb the arrangements under which it operated. I felt that this was an important consideration, so for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1584</span>
those reasons we decided to leave it alone and not to interfere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) for the kinder words that he has used about ACAS in this debate than I have sometimes heard him use. I accept that he wants to put ACAS into a position of objectivity rather than subjectivity, perhaps. In other words he wants the objectives of ACAS to be clearly laid down and not just to have the position where ACAS does what it thinks fit in any situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that my hon. Friend's fears in this respect are unjustified now, as regards collective bargaining. I hope that he can see an encouragement of the extension of collective bargaining where this can be accomplished by voluntary means and that ACAS can play a part in this, and that groups of workers—wherever they need to do so—will use the voluntary arrangements which would be rather better perhaps than using the compulsory arrangements under sections 11 to 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore believe that this amendment is unnecessary in the circumstances. ACAS would be left only with the general duty of promoting the improvement of industrial relations, and I think that it would be best to leave the words alone. I therefore ask my hon. Friend whether he is prepared to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to follow the advice of my right hon. Friend, but may I make one observation before doing so? My experience in dealing with ACAS has been to suggest that it has sometimes used the argument with employers that they have an obligation under section 1(2) to foster collective bargaining and that other options were not open to them. It may not have been put in quite those bald terms, but that was the suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my right hon. Friend is saying—or hoping—that in future this sort of approach will not be a bother, I am happy that it should be totally impartial, detached and objective, and treat all situations on their merits. If that is the case, what matters is how it proceeds rather than what is on the statute book. I therefore urge my right hon. Friend, when he looks at the practice of the legislation on which we have embarked—perhaps at a post-Green Paper stage, if there are still complaints about lack of even-handedness on the part of ACAS—to look at it again.
