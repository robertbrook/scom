	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 150, in page 12, line 21, after '(2)', insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"subject to the provisions of subsection (5) below".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take amendment No. 153, in page 13, line 10, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(5) In determining for the purposes of section 56 whether a woman who has been re-engaged under a new contract of employment in pursuance of an offer made under subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>) above has been dismissed, the provisions of section 84(3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) shall apply."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you will have observed, Mr. Goodhew, amendment No. 150 is no more than a paving to No. 153. Amendment No. 153 contains the substantive point. The substantive point, although extremely important to the relatively small number of people who will be covered by it, is simple and clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will be aware that when a person is offered alternative employment in a redundancy situation, he is allowed to have a trial period in the alternative appointment. It would be grossly unfair if a woman offered alternative employment in a maternity situation were any worse off than a person offered alternative employment in a redundancy situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of the amendment, therefore, is to provide that she, too, may have a trial period in the alternative employment. It is as plain and simple as that. If it were refused, I do not see how anyone could rebut the contention that this clause was discriminatory in sex terms. I therefore have every confidence that the hon. and learned Gentleman will rise to inform you Mr. Goodhew, that he accepts the amendment, and then we need do no more than exchange words of mutual respect, regard
	<span class='label label-info column'>1256</span>
and appreciation across the Floor of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For my part, I can fulfil my side of that exchange. I immediately appreciate the motive that lies behind the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo), and I appreciate the clarity and precision with which he has moved it. I am able to tell him that it is not necessary because the clause is not expressed in a way which is on all fours with the approximately parallel provision in the redundancy provisions of the 1978 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can explain why that is so, but at the outset I assure the hon. Gentleman that the woman coming back at the end of her maternity leave who is offered a job which the employer regards as a suitable alternative is no worse off than the woman who is an applicant under the redundancy provision. There is an equal, indeed better, opportunity for a trial period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The section of the 1978 Act which deals with the redundancy situation provides that where a job given to an employee by his employer as an alternative when he has been made redundant involves a change in the terms and conditions of his employment, and the employee takes that job, he must be given a trial period of four weeks in which to decide finally whether to accept that job. The trial period is given to him because section 84 does not require that the job offered be suitable or appropriate. It has been thought desirable in that event that the employee should have a chance to experience the job and give it a try before committing himself to accepting it. As a result, once he has accepted it, he forgoes his right to a redundancy payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, section 60, which provides for the offer of an alternative job when an employee cannot have her original job back after a confinement, does not require a trial period. Like the clause with which we are dealing, it provides that the job offered must be suitable and appropriate to the employee and contain terms not substantially less favourable than the corresponding provisions of the previous contract. Where the previous employment is terminated, should the alternative job not meet those criteria, the employee cannot, even by accepting it, debar herself from making a claim for unfair dismissal in respect to that termination. If she accepts the job and then finds,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1177">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1257</span>
within the three-month period, that it is not suitable, and can establish that it is not suitable—indeed, I do not think that the burden would be on her to establish that it was not suitable—she is not debarred from her claim of unfair dismissal in respect of that termination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same is true of new section 56A. Unless the job complies with the requirements of new section 56A(3), section 56 will not be disapplied, regardless of whether the woman has accepted the job or refused it, reasonably or unreasonably. She will be treated in accordance with section 56 as having been dismissed for the reason that she was not allowed to return to her former job. Accordingly, the employee will be better able to judge whether the job is acceptable after she has tried it out. The new provision does not prevent her from doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I am not to depart from the example of brevity set by the hon. Gentleman, I think that that is enough to assure him that his amendments are unnecessary. I shall gladly expand on the matter if I have to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for his explanation and for the assurances which it contained. In the light of those assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 135, in page 13, line 1, leave out 'substantially'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the meaning of "substantially" is very much open to interpretation. An employer may not think that the alternative job that he is offering to the woman who wants to come back to work is very different, but the woman herself, who may have a new baby and may have to fit her work arrangements in with child care, may take a different view. If the word is left in the Bill, many women in this situation may be forced to accept alternative employment, if they are offered it, rather than return to their original jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is questionable whether there is a sufficiently vast range of jobs open to women for them to have much choice. It is important to protect the situation of women at work as much as possible, so that if the question of alternative employment arises they will not be worse off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1258</span>
For instance, a woman may be offered a job which may not look substantially less favourable but, on examination she may find that the terms and conditions are very different. I am sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman will say again that this will be for the tribunals to decide. But how substantial is "substantial"? For instance, could a managing director's secretary be asked to work in the typing pool, provided that the hours and conditions were the same? Would that constitute a substantial difference? Could a woman be asked to work in a clerical job in another section of the firm where the promotion prospects were worse or redundancy more likely? Would that count as substantial change?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1978 Act already provides flexibility for employers, and the tribunals have interpreted section 45 in some cases to allow the offer of a similar job. The employee may be transferred to a different department so long as the duties of the post are within the terms of the original contract of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the word "substantially" is left in, there will be grounds for endless wrangling and more uncertainty. Once again, we come back to the argument about more uncertainty which we have had throughout the discussions on this and the preceding clause, and which the hon. and learned Gentleman has told us repeatedly is not his objective: he wants more certainty. I think that deleting the word "substantially" would create more certainty. If it is left in, it will certainly not help working women to secure their rights, which are already seriously undermined by these clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervene only because I have recently had occasion, in connection with another Bill to study the word "substantially". In the case of that Private Member's Bill, the word "substantially" was a central point of importance to a much greater extent than it is in the clause before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who were involved in the Committee stage of that Bill had a very close look at the word "substantially" and, although we were all laymen, we were able to consult legal documents. The one to which I always turn, because I find it a good child's guide for laymen to legal phraseology, is Butterworth's Legal Dictionary. I dare say that it is known to the hon. and learned Gentleman, although I am sure that the authorities which he con-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1259</span>
sults are A-level compared with my O-level and are of a much more advanced and complex grade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, dear old Butterworth is a good standby. And Butterworth, having examined cases in which the word was in issue and having gone over all the record, comes to the conclusion, which it states very clearly, that the words "substantial" and "substantially" are not an adequate and acceptable measure of a proportion or a size. That is pretty clear, is it not? I translate that into my East-End language as Butterworth saying that "substantial" is "how long is a piece of string?" Again, this is a bit of a bonanza for the hon. and learned Gentleman's profession, because undoubtedly there will be cases in which reference will be made to a court about specific instances of a job being offered in which one side says that the terms were substantially different and the other side says that they were not, and in the end it will finish up being argued by the lawyers, to their great profit but to nobody else's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an obligation upon the House to try to frame our legislation as best we can so that there is nothing in it so ambiguous or unclear as to demand or even to permit a reference to the courts in order to discover what Parliament meant. We must do our best to say that we mean in terms so clear that nobody needs to do further research to discover what we mean. I know that that is a counsel of perfection and, however much we try, we shall never succeed 100 per cent., but we must try, and one part of the trying is to avoid terms which open the way to differences of interpretation on matters of such importance that recourse will be had to the courts. On those grounds, I strongly support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While the hon. Gentleman was speaking, I was trying to remember that even more obscure line of the hymn which goes "Trans-substantial, co-eternal"—something, something—"ages run". I can sing it, but I am afraid I cannot provide the missing words—and I might well be out of order, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise with what has been said by the hon. Members for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) and for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant), but I am quite satisfied, and hope to be able to persuade the Committee, that it would be wrong to pass this amendment. It is impossible to gives
	<span class='label label-info column'>1260</span>
mathematical accuracy to "substantial" as a measure of degree. It is rather like talking about the length of a piece of string. On the other hand, Parliament has to try to find some adjective, some guidance, some steer that gives effect to its wishes. In practice, our experience is that tribunals such as the industrial tribunals do not have very much difficulty in distinguishing what is a substantial difference from a marginal, trivial or superficial one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is our purpose here? We are saying—and not for the first time in this type of legislation—that if one wishes to be excused from giving to the returning woman employee her old job back, one may be excused only if there is an alternative job offered that is not much worse. If we do not find some word to express that thought, that desire, that "not much worse" idea, the interpretation given to our statute will be: that she has to be given back a job that is exactly as good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite right. I am grateful for the correction. The woman's job should be exactly as good, or better. That would be to impose an unfair burden upon an employer. How much better? We would then have to say: is it to be substantially better or would any degree better suffice? Therefore, because it would impose an unfair burden on tribunals, as well as upon employers, we think it important to have some sort of adjective and guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we simply said "exactly as good or better", an argument could be mounted that the job was marginally, superficially or trivially worse and therefore she had been unfairly dismissed. That would not be the intention of Parliament, because it would take up the time of tribunals in determining how many angels can stand upon the head of that pin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So "substantially" is used. It is not used here for the first time. Section 45 of the 1978 Act reproduces the working of the 1975 Act in this regard. Section 45 confers a right to return to work by subsection (3), and by subsection (3) it requires that the offer of an alternative job should be made and says that if it is not practicable for the employer to permit her to return to her job by reason of redundancy, then, provided that there is a suitable vacancy, an offer of an alternative job must be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4) of that Act goes on to describe what shall be a suitable altern-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1261</span>
ative job. That wording of subsection (4) is reproduced in the new provision for section 56 that we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what is done in the existing statute by Parliament. "Substantially" is the word used. I shall read it so that we have it absolutely in perspective:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) The new contract of employment must be such that—
	<ol>
	<li>the work to be done under the contract is of a kind which is both suitable in relation to the employee and appropriate for her to do in the circumstances; and</li>
	<li>the provisions of the new contract as to the capacity and place in which she is to be employed and as to the other terms and conditions of her employment are not substantially less favourable to her than if she had returned to work in accordance with subsection (1).".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
That is the wording used in 1978 and 1975 and to which the tribunals are well accustomed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a redundancy situation, is it not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Redundancy—that is right. But the problems of interpretation under this clause are no different from those under the identical wording used to describe what is a suitable alternative job in that statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new section 56A to be inserted in that Act by clause 11 adds to the flexibility which section 45 gives. An employee returning from maternity leave. She has been absent from work—I quote from section 45—
	<br><blockquote><p>"wholly or partly because of pregnancy or confinement".</p></blockquote>
Section 45 only to redundancy, but we are adding to the flexibility that section 45 gives to an employee by dealing separately with circumstances apart from redundancy which make it not reasonably practicable for her to have her old job back. In this case, she must have been offered suitable alternative employment defined exactly as in section 45 (4), from which I have already read, and she must either have accepted it or unreasonably refused it, in the opinion of the tribunal, in which case she shall not be taken to have been unfairly dismissed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 135, to which belatedly I now come, makes a distinction in the criterion of suitable alternative job. It is an undesirable distinction which we invite the Committee to reject because it takes out the word "substantially"—
	<span class='label label-info column'>1262</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the provisions of the contract as to the capacity and place in which she is to be employed and as to the other terms and conditions of her employment are not less favourable to her "—</p></blockquote>
and so on. If "substantially" is taken out, anybody construing the new provision will have regard to that. Parliament will be inviting the tribunal to make very fine distinction, and arguments will be mounted as to whether even a trivial or superficial diminutation in the favourability of the job has actually occurred. The amendment would therefore result in an undesirable and, we believe, unnecessary discrepancy between the new provisions and the present ones whereby an employer can offer suitable alternative work to a woman returning after maternity leave whose original job has disappeared because of redundancy. That is section 45.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Industrial tribunals would have difficulty in determining whether defferent work was not less favourable in any or every respect. They have experience under the redundancy provisions in deciding what constitutes "suitable" and "appropriate" work in all the circumstances, and alternative work which was significantly less favourable in any respect would be unlikely to fulfill the criteria of "suitable" and "appropriate," Perhaps to the point of weariness I am once again saying we can with confidence leave this to the tribunals. We have been doing so in the redundancy jurisdiction that we have given under the legislation passed by the Labour Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tribunals are used to this, and we are not aware of significant difficulties that they have experienced in trying to give effect to Parliament's wording. But we reasonably foresee unnecessary and quite substantial difficulties if we make the distinction that the amendment seeks to import. For those reasons, I advise the Committee that it would not make good legislation. It would create more difficulties than would be justified by the very slight improvement it would give to the rights of the returning employee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has been less than convincing in trying to advise the Committee that "substantially" should remain in the clause. He gave us an extract from previous Acts where the word "substantially" remains in a particular section, but that related entirely to redundancy. In a redundancy situation jobs do not exist. They dis-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1180">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1263</span>
appear. As a consequence, there is the possibility that someone will have to accept a similar job which is not equivalent in all respects to the previous job, and thus a case can be made for the word "substantially" to remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we are dealing here with maternity leave a job already exists, and there is every expectation on the part of the woman worker who has left to have a baby that she will return to the identical job which she left. Therefore, we fall back on the interpretation of the word "substantially". According to the clause, this applies not only to the terms and conditions of employment but also
	<br><blockquote><p>"to the capacity and place in which she is to be employed".</p></blockquote>
What is the sense of "substantially"? For example, if a woman worker was advised that the only job available was at a salary of £5 per week below the salary that she had before she left employment, would that be a substantial drop in her income, or would £10 be regarded as a substantial drop? We must have a definition of what is meant by "substantially" in this connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the clause refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the capacity and place in which she is to be employed",</p></blockquote>
is it substantially less favourable for her to be told that there is no vacancy in that particular office but she has to travel five miles to another office where she could do a similar job? All sorts of difficulties will be created if the word "substantially" is incorporated in the clasue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, there is little difficulty in negotiating on questions of redundancy. The trade unions, by and large, have reached agreement with employers that when redundancy arises people are transferred to other jobs on the same terms and conditions of employment as their previous jobs, and it is apparent to trade unionists that if people are demoted as a result of redundancies there will be industrial conflict.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we do not have the same situation. When a woman leaves her employment, she has the hope of getting back her same job in the same office on the same terms and conditions of employment. But if the</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>word "substantially" is left in the Bill she will be in some doubt. She will not know what type of employment will be granted to her when she returns after her pregnancy and confinement. As a consequence there will be conflict in the workplace; there will be conflict between trade unions and management on the interpretation of the word "substantially". We are creating a precedent by putting this in because there is no precedent in previous Acts. I hope that the Under-Secretary will think very seriously about the representations which we are making before the clause is passed with this word included.</p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not convinced, either, by the hon. and learned Gentleman's arguments. He explained his position clearly. Our case—to cut away the trimmings—is that the woman who takes maternity leave should, when she goes back to work, not be disadvantaged. That puts it in a nutshell. When the hon. and learned Gentleman, as my hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher) has just demonstrated, referred to existing legislation he was referring to redundancy. There is a sharp difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether the amendment is accepted or not, the tribunals will have the last word. We are saying that, if the word "substantially" is left in there will be wider flexibility within which the tribunals can make their decisions. We are putting the emphasis on there being no disadvantage. clearly, a tribunal looking at such a case will not make the comparison absolutely precisely. It is impossible to be so perfectionist. But with the emphasis on no disadvantage we build into the clause that additional protection for working women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Seen in isolation, the hon. and learned Gentleman's arguments seem reasonable, but in the context of the clasue as a whole, which undermines the rights of working women, they appear in a different light. I therefore advise my right hon and hon. Friends to press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 9, Noes 12.</p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1181">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1265</span>
	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been over most of the arguments on the clause in some detail so I do not intend to take long in arguing that the clause should not stand part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said earlier that clauses 10 and 11 have succeeded in dividing women into two groups: The first consists of those with reinstatement rights who will be aware of those rights and will safeguard them by writing in appropriately, whether they intend to return to work or not. That will simply create more uncertainty. The second group consists of those who will simply not understand what is going on and will therefore be deprived of their rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is a third group as well—those in small firms who will have no rights at all as a consequence of the clause. It could be described as a three-tier system which the Government are setting up rather than the two-tier system about which even the hon. and learned Gentleman expressed some anxiety, while at the same time rejecting our arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must return briefly to the evidence—or non-evidence—which the hon. and learned Gentleman has sought to present to us. He found it even harder going on clause 11 to give us anything at all on which to bite than when he was dealing with clause 10. That is not surprising because there is no evidence of any consequence. There was that rather curious letter from a head teacher of a comprehensive school, and the hon. and learned Gentleman may have been able to authenticate the source during the weekend. Perhaps "authenticate" is not the right word, because I am not suggesting that it was of dubious parentage, but he did say that at that time he had not had opportunity to clear the thing with the author and with the Member who sent it to him. Perhaps he can do that now, and the Committee would be interested to know what sort of headmaster could come up with that sort of letter—although it is not a point of great importance. My hon. Friends, and particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther), sprang in and rapidly demolished that argument and piece of so-called evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member of Chippenham (Mr. Needham). sprang to the defence of hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1266</span>
and learned Gentleman. I am sorry he is not with us now; he might have treated us to some further information about the delights of the fair Marjorie. I doubt, however, that it would have added much to the argument because, as I pointed out earlier, if employers and employees can reach that kind of amicable arrangement—and there is no reason why they should not—there is no case for bothering to change the legislation anyway. So I do not see what the point of his intervention was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout his defence of the clause, the hon. and learned Gentleman has been scraping the barrel. In my closing remarks on Thursday afternoon, I asked him whether he could give us some indication of how many women would actually be deprived of their rights. I quoted from a document which my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) passed to me which indicated that, when the previous legislation was going through the House, he had been advised that if the exemption was related to four employees instead of five, that would affect about ½ million working women who would be deprived of their rights. Now we have five, not four, as the figure for exemption and, moreover, since that time the increase in the total of women in the labour force has been considerable. Therefore, on both counts the figure must be appreciably more—perhaps in the region of ¾ million or more. It would be helpful if the hon and. learned Gentleman given an indication of how many working women will be adversely affected by the Government's legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would have been even more helpful if that kind of information had been given before the general election. We all remember the Saatchi & Saatchi slogans in that pre-election period: "Cheer up, the Conservatives are coming", "Don't just hope for a better life—vote for one" and It's time for a change"—the one attacking our "spending cuts", as they put it, on schools and hospitals. And we remember the dole queue advertisements. But Mr. Saatchi did not have a chat with Mr. Saatchi and come up with slogans relating to women's rights. We could have had "Choose with the Tories—your baby or your job." Or, if we had wanted to be a little more subtle, we could have had "Tories help the under-fives", which would have been misleading to mothers and small employers alike. But we did not get any indication from their manifesto of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1182">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1267</span>
any such changes at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, although they can claim a mandate for change in other areas—though whether they are wise to go ahead with it is something upon which we have made our position clear—on these clauses there is no mandate. No indication was given to women voters in particular who will be affected that their rights in this respect were to be undermined. We shall certainly wish to oppose clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Giles Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make three brief comments. First, everybody is in favour of small-size firms these days. I do not know what the real evidence is that small firms create more jobs, but we are all beginning to think that that is true. Most people believe that it is better to work for a small firm than for a big firm. Perhaps we are all in favour of "small is beautiful." But the trouble is that on this clause, as with earlier clauses, the Government are in danger of giving small size a bad name. They are in danger of creating a two-class economy, of small firms where rights of workers will not be fully recognised and other firms where they will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second comment is this. I have just been rereading the speeches on this clause on Thursday, including the speech of the hon. and learned Gentleman. I often read at night the hon. and learned Gentleman's speeches. I do not like being impolite to him, but he is in danger of giving the legal profession a bad name, because I understood that the legal profession was all about giving evidence for one's statements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A worse name.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A worse name, perhaps. I understood that the legal profession was all about giving evidence, but I then compared my hon. Friend's speech with the hon. and learned Gentleman's speech on the amendments to this clause. My hon. Friend produced an amazing amount of evidence. He might even be accused of producing too much. But the hon. and learned Gentleman produced almost no evidence at all to support his view on the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end by echoing what my hon. Friend said, that this really is the creation of a three-tier system. More than that, it is a diminution of rights. I believe that we are here to create rights for employees, not to take them away. We shall be taking them away if we allow this clause to stand part
	<span class='label label-info column'>1268</span>
of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I oppose the clause because I oppose the Government's approach and motivation in their whole attitude. The question of to whom we give the balance of advantage in situations like this seems in many ways to sum up the difference in our social values.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that the Government would want to help women who have babies, that they would have wanted to take care of them and give them more assistance. Instead of that, they are making life harder for them and taking their rights away. I am amazed that they should seek to do this, and specifically to think that this is the way to help small businesses. There are all sorts of ways in which to help small businesses; this is not the right way at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman said at a previous sitting that our claim that the Government were creating different classes of citizen would have more substance on this clause. He admitted that himself. It is true. We have three tiers. There are those women with statutory rights and those who will have none. He says that this is the way to help small firms. That seems to be the logic of the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we asked for the evidence showing how this new system would help small firms, we were not given any. But that seems to be the presumption. I should be better convinced if the Minister did something about bank lending to these firms or about their value added tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British women employees will have less favourable maternity rights than all their European sisters have. We cannot be proud of that. Instead of raising our standards, the Government are cold-bloodedly and deliberately setting out to lower them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard about the three letters which the woman must write—and this from a Government who want to cut out bureaucracy. In my constituency there are many low-paid immigrant workers who work for small firms. Their English is not very good and some of them have great difficulty. The whole thing will be made worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also introducing a great deal of uncertainty when we talk about whether it is reasonably practicable to give people back their jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1183">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1269</span>
Where we it is said that the job should be "not less favourable", the hon. and learned Gentleman wants the word "substantially". Previously, he has extolled the virtues of the tribunals, saying that they are all men of the world who will understand the situation. They would be able to interpret "not less favourable" from their knowledge of the world and of industry. But if we have in the word "substantially", lawyers can play about with it. There could be long arguments and things could be difficult. I should have thought that his past recommnedation of leaving it to the tribunal was an argument in favour of leaving out the word "substantially".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I deal immediately with what the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) has just said? I do not detract in the slightest from what I previously said about the capability of tribunals to apply the commonsense standards that Parliament requires of them. But we must give them some help. They can apply the law only as Parliament lays it down. If we impose upon them the task of making very nice distinctions and discerning a difference that may be only trivial but, because of the wording of our statute, we tell them that they must see whether it is there and then take account of it and give effect to it, we are not helping them in the way we should, and we are not using them in the way they ought to be used. That is why I say that a lot of trouble would be caused by taking out the word "substantially".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to make a detailed speech on the clause in this debate, but may I take up the point made by the hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher). There is no distinction in principle between the wording used in relation to redundancy as a reason for the job not being able to be returned and the wording used where some reason other than redundancy accounts for the old job not being able to be offered. What we are talking about is the guidance that we give in this wording to a tribunal. The principle is not affected by whether the job cannot be offered back by reason of redundancy or whether it is not reasonably practicable to offer it back for some other reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newham, North-East returned to the charge that we were imposing on our women standards far lower than those that their European
	<span class='label label-info column'>1270</span>
sisters would enjoy. I remind him of the point that I made—without going over it in details—about European comparisons when that came up at our last sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are miles ahead of the field in Europe on the duration of maternity leave. The total period of 40 weeks is ahead of the field. Our only challenger is Western Germany, where the basic period is eight weeks and, within one month of the baby's birth, the woman has to apply for an additional four months. The 40 weeks is a very substantial advantage indeed conferred upon the woman in our country who takes maternity leave over those whom the hon. Gentleman described as her European sisters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman tell us of any European countries which exempt small firms?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I can lay my finger upon the note which tells me of the discrimination that does exist in several, but not all, European countries in respect of employers with fewer than a certain relatively small number. There is a note and I shall have it in a second. We are by no means alone among the countries of Western Europe in discriminating between firms in this context that employ a relatively small number. I shall come back to that in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The corollary of giving a long maximum duration of maternity leave is this. It imposes on an employer a proportionately harder task in planning his employment policy. The longer he has to wait before he knows whether a woman who has taken maternity leave is in fact coming back, the harder his job is. Incidentally, it is a harder position, too, for any temporary replacement that he may have secured. This is an important point which ought to be taken into account when European comparisons are being made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that that is important. Will the hon. and learned Gentleman comment on the point I have raised with him several times—that one consequence of this legislation will be that more and more women who undertsand the system, despite the complex nature of the notification procedure, will take the view that they must safeguard their position and they will write in and say that they wish to resume working even when, in practice, they will not return. That figure
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1184">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1271</span>
will rise, and there will be more uncertainty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge that there is a risk that some women will fail to learn of, or remember, their obligations. The Department of Employment will take all reasonably practical steps to publicise this change in the law and, with the help of the Department, of doctors and other agencies—and of employees themselves—the incidence of that problem will be kept down to a minimum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman misunderstood my point. It was not about those who did not understand the requirements but about those who do. We know that a lot of women safeguard their position by writing to say they are returning when in fact they do not. What I am saying is that as, a consequence of this legislation, more and more women will safeguard their position where they do understand it, so the uncertainty for the employer will be heightened, not reduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for misunderstanding the hon. Member. We must wait and see. I do not think that it is likely to occur because, where a woman is afforded an intermediate opportunity of saying whether she wishes to come back, the incidence of inaccurate expressions of opinion or intention will be low. If the hon. Gentleman is right—and I see the argument—surely, the boot is on the other foot. Under the present law, as we know so well, the woman has to give her first notice before she goes off on maternity leave, and there is no intermediate period at all. She may go right up to the twenty-eighth week after confinement before she has to give her notice confirming that she wants to come back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An employer in those circumstances will be seriously at sea. He cannot know what the ultimate result will be. But it is a different matter when a woman is invited to consider her position at an intermediate stage. She has to do it only if invited, and not earlier than seven weeks after confinement. If she says "Yes, I am coming back " and does not, I agree that in practice no prejudice results to her. We accept that, whatever the strict position in law may be. But I do not think that people will deliberately say that there is nothing to lose. If that happens, it will happen. But we believe with some confidence that the position of employers will be significantly
	<span class='label label-info column'>1272</span>
alleiviated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. and learned Gentleman really agrees with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not think so. We shall have to see how it goes. I am not saying that it is not possible at all, but I do not think that there will be greater uncertainty. Indeed, it is hard to see how there could be greater uncertainty than at the present moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal has been said. When I was referring to the point about discrimination against small numbers, what I had in mind was those European countries which discriminate in the whole area of unfair dismissal in respect of small numbers of employees. So far as I am aware, there is no express discrimination in the context of notice, but only in the case of Western Germany, I think I am right in saying, is there a requirement for notice. The point is obviously sound, that the longer the duration of maternity leave the greater is the difficulty for an employer if he is left without any indication about whether she is coming back or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. and learned Gentleman got his note. I think that it bears out precisely what I was saying, and that his presumption that our conditions here are not worse was wrong. So I am grateful to whoever handed over that note. It underlined what I was saying—that this provision, which is thought so necessary by a Government led by a lady, is not thought necessary by private enterprise economies on the Continent. This is another way in which we shall be giving our women less rights than their European sisters have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be, but at the risk of wearying the Committee, I repeat that it must be looked at against the background of the length of maternity leave that is available here. Let me remind the hon. Gentleman—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is. It must be looked at in this context because it is a fact that roughly around the time we are expecting our women to confirm their intention to return under this provision, many other members of the EEC are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1185">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1273</span>
expecting their women to be back at work. If the hon. Gentleman is making the point that we are somehow putting our women into a worse position, he must acknowledge that they are and will remain far ahead in that regard. It is only fair to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next, it was said that this is a monstrous whittling away of rights, and the hon. Member for Newham, North-East said that women employed by the very small firms to which clause 11 applies would have no statutory rights at all. That must not be allowed to go unchallenged. The assertion that these women will have no statutory rights cannot be upheld.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us look at the clause. A woman will have no right to return only if she works for a firm whose employees do not exceed five in number, and the employer at first finds it not reasonably practicable to offer her old job back, nor reasonably practicable to offer her a suitable alternative Those are rights which are confirmed by statute. Only in those circumstances, which will not be easy to establish, is she not to have the right to return that other women have by statute. It would be true to say that she had not statutory rights only if the clause said to a person who worked for an employer with five or fewer employees "Sorry, you've had it" in all circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have gone over the motivation for the clause. It would not add to the value of our proceedings if I were to spend much time rehearsing once more why the Government are making these proposals. I say only that it is the Government's purpose to encourage the very small employer to risk—if I may put it in this way—taking women into his employment. I do not use the word "risk" in any slighting sense. We all know how very valuable women are in many jobs. The risk lies in the consequences of confinement. We have gone over the nature of that risk. It is the Government's belief that it militates against the prospects of women getting and keeping employment. It is for that reason that we wish to make these special provisions. To a lesser extent we are proposing in the clause to legislate for women employed by all firms generally, not merely small firms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I dealt fairly with the Committee in our last session, when I set out the nature of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1274</span>
the Government's thinking and the reasons why we believe that is a desirable proposal. It is worth reminding the Committee that the Government were glad to accept, and were grateful for, the amendment whose effect was that there should be, on the request made by the employer seven weeks or more after confinement, a notification to the woman of the consequences of failing to comply with the request. I think that the Government's case for making this has been substantiated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having listened to the debate on "clause stand part", I must advise my hon. Friends that there is no substantial reason for taking this clause out of the Bill. I advise them to vote for it to stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric G. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there has been a time during the 24 sittings of the Committee when the hon. and learned Gentleman has been less convincing than he has on this clause. He is usually extremely persuasive, although he has been stubborn—on occasions pigheaded—about accepting amendments on some of the other clauses, but I am sure that my hon. Friends have found that in his replies to this debate he has given no justification for leaving the clause in the Bill. He has been grasping at straws all the way through to try to justify what the Government are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From my point of view—a view which is shared by many of my hon. Friends—this is the most mean-minded and petty of all the clauses in the Bill. The Minister has not produced a shred of evidence to justify keeping it. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) has done the Committee a great service in the powerful case that he has put forward. He has produced great chunks of evidence from all sorts of bodies, such as the Equal Opportunities Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman is laughing because I commented that this is independent evidence that has been produced by the Equal Opportunities Commission. I suppose that in the vocabulary of the Conservatives it is a quango, but it is one which they want to maintain. It is a representative body, which has produced evidence to show that the clause is discriminatory and bad.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the right hon. Gentleman recall, as a member of the Government at the time, why his Government made the same exemption under the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1186">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1275</span>
Sex Discrimination Act for firms employing five or fewer employees from the operation of that Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I say that this goes much further than anything proposed by the last Government; the conditions and the bureaucracy attached to it go much further. There are the letters and all the other things that the Government want to be produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is other evidence too. There is the substantial evidence that the Low Pay Unit has provided to all members of this Committee, which I found very convincing. The National Council for Civil Liberties and other bodies have produced evidence. The Institute of Personnel Management has produced evidence which has not convinced the Government that they should make changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The justification is supposed to be contained in the phrase which the hon. and learned Gentleman used—I am not quoting him directly—that it is to help small businesses. He went even further at our last sitting, when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In our manifesto, we said that we would reform those aspects of the employment protection legislation which were operating in such a way as to harm employment prospects."</p></blockquote>
He went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We recognise—there is plenty of independent authority for this—"</p></blockquote>
although he has not produced very much for this—
	<br><blockquote><p>"that it is particularly in the area of the small firms that we can most hopefully look for the creation of new jobs."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 13 March 1980; c. 1235.]</p></blockquote>
What have this Government done for small firms in the 10 months they have been in office? How can they produce a clause like this when everything else they are doing is damaging small businesses with an untold impact?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The phrase that most members of the Committee objected to a few moments ago was that women were a "great risk" to small businesses; a potential employer must be extremely cautious before taking on these creatures, because they may in some way prevent that small business from operating successfully. I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will reflect on that and on the words that he used. I know that he tried to qualify it, but at one point I think he realised that he had gone too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us look for a moment at the risks and opportunities that this Government
	<span class='label label-info column'>1276</span>
have created for small businesses. The Minister used the phrase "hopefully look for the creation of new jobs".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us look at the achievements of the last 10 months. How has soaring inflation affected small businesses? Half of the present 19½ per cent. inflation rate is Government inspired in one way or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we have plummeting production. The Government's official estimate is that it will go down by about 2 per cent. this year, and in my judgment it will go down even further. We are in the midst of some of the most damaging industrial disputes, which the Government are not attempting to bring to an end. We already have a record number of working days lost, which are affecting small businesses-28 million working days lost so far in the 10 months since the Government have been in office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How small businesses are surviving with the present minimum lending rate, I just do not know. Then there is the appallingly low investment which is taking place. Some of the small businesses which this Government seek to help by justifying clause 11 are being badly affected by the savage public expenditure cuts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also know that anything that was being done to assist small businesses has been put into reverse by the Government Even in February of this year, the small firms employment subsidy, which is the direct responsibility of the Government and the Department of Employment, was abandoned completely. We shall not take it from the hon. and learned Gentleman and his hon. Friends that these changes in employment protection for women will assist small businesses, when everything else that the Government are doing is damaging small businesses so much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) drew the Committee's attention to the changes that are taking place and how women in this country will be substantially worse off than their counterparts in Europe. That again is rather strange from a Government who are supposed to support in its entirety our continued membership of the European Economic Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, if clause 10 and particularly clause 11 stand part of the Bill, no woman will get her job back unless she has exceptional talents which the small firm really wants to use after the confinement has taken place, or unless she has a large
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1187">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1277</span>
trade union behind her. I doubt whether that will happen as regards this clause. Some of the women operating in small businesses will not have the protection of the trade union.

All this comes from a Government headed by a woman. What the Government are doing in this clause is utterly disgraceful. Instead of seeking to justify it, they should be hanging their heads in shame. They will rue the day when this legislation reaches the statute book, and they will pay dearly for it in loss of women's support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to intervene briefly because it is important for the Opposition to put their feelings about clause 11 on record. We know that the Government are a racist Government, and now the evidence is that they are a sexist Government also. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) said, when there is a general election clause 11 will figure in the debate. Despite the fact that they are led by a woman Prime Minister, the Government seem to have forgotten that the majority of the voting population are female. The message will go out from women's organisations throughout the country that the Government have betrayed every election pledge that they made to women. Women will recall that the next time that we are called upon to vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that the purpose of clause 11 is to help small businesses. It is suggested that, if women are deprived of rights for which they fought long and hard and which the Labour Government enacted, that will improve employment opportunities and the business capabilities of small firms. Nothing could be further from the truth. Relationships in most small firms are good. When the tiny minority of women who work for small firms and who become pregnant leave to have their babies, suitable arrangements can easily be made between the employer and his employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the thinking behind these clauses in this diabolical Bill is to use them as an excuse. In the very near future thousands of small business men will realise, as they are sitting in the bankruptcy court, that they were desperately conned at the last general election. They assumed that a Tory Government were favourable to small businesses and would
	<span class='label label-info column'>1278</span>
help them. But, as every hon. Member now knows from his daily postbag, small businesses are increasingly in trouble, particularly because of high interest rates and other actions of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen when the Small Businesses Bureau people and all the others involved in chambers of commerce which have been quoted in the Committee start to realise that they were conned by the Government? They will start protesting to the Government, through their Tory Members of Parliament, and then they will be told "What on earth are you talking about? You told us that your great problems were in the Employment Protection Act. We have put right the things about which you complained in that Act, particularly in clauses 7 and 11, you are still screaming your heads off. Go away and don't bother us. We shall have to fall back on our"—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Conservatives did not tell the small businessmen. The evidence shows a different picture. That is what the Conservatives imagine from their own prejudices, but it is not based on any evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The gist of my argument is that it was a con trick which was worked by the Tory Party on small businesses during the general election by persuading small business men that a Tory Government would be favourable towards small business, whereas a Labour Government would be hostile. We were so "hostile" that we put Acts such as the Employment Protection Act on to the statute book, and the Tories said that they would repeal those provisions of the Employment Protection Act which the Tory Party, through its propaganda machine, was telling small businesses were harmful to their establishment. We all know that, if it was not a pack of lies, it certainly had little relation to the truth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When these small business men are sitting in the bankruptcy court waiting for their company to be put into liquidation, and when they go screaming to their Tory Members, they will be told "Well, we solved all the problems that you were concerned about. You are simply complaining now. We have set the climate right for you". Indeed, the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Industry never stop talking about setting the climate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the climate that the Govern-

ment have set? It includes a 17 per cent. minimum lending rate, which means that the cost of borrowing money for a small business man is running at 20 per cent or 21 per cent. That, of course, is driving them all to the wall, and these clauses have little relationship to the many real problems that they are facing. That is the thrust of my argument, as I am sure my hon. Friends appreciate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that every women's organisation throughout the length and breadth of Great Britain will get that message out to women—that the Tory Government are not only racist but sexist. The only thing to do with people who are racists and</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee long, but we have no intention of letting the clause pass on the nod, not least because so far, to the best of my recollection, we have not had a single word of explanation or justification of this yet further worsening of the terms of employment for a large number of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is first of all for the Government to explain why they are doing this. Any changes require an explanation, and we are entitled to ask what arguments the Government adduce for doing this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that when the Conservatives were in opposition and the Employment Protection Bill was in Committee they sought to change the terms of the then Bill to give effect to what is now in clause 12. Indeed, I recall that I was the Minister</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1280</span>
	<p>sexists is to reject them. The first opportunity will be at the local government elections. Next year people will have the opportunity at the county council elections. In between, with luck, the Government will finally collapse in a heap of ruins, as they deserve. We shall defeat them and a Labour Government will be returned who will put reasonable and decent legislation onto the statute book.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 12, Noes 10.</p>
	<p>handling that part of the Bill in Committee, and I promised to look at the arguments that had been advanced for putting guaranteed pay on the basis of a rolling quarter rather than the fixed periods which are in the 1978 Act.</p>
	<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman was a member of that Committee, and he will recall that when the Bill was referred back to the House in Report, we said that we had looked carefully at the arguments, and had considered which was the better way to do it, and we were still convinced that the way that is now in the Act was the correct way. I shall briefly put forward the arguments advanced by the officials of the Department at the time in favour of retaining the fixed calendar quarter method instead of the rolling 13-week period. I quote from the briefings which were supplied to me by the Department and which I have, whether properly or improperly, since retained. We said then that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"fixed quarter limits are specified in 	<i>Sub-section</i> (2) because the calendar quarter method is relatively simple to operate and does not give rise to the anomalies which are caused by rolling 13-week periods. For example, with a rolling period, guarantee pay might be given to one worker and not to another in similar circumstances, if their patterns of short time were similar but not identical."</p></blockquote></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1189">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1281</span>
	<p>Furthermore, to go to the rolling quarterly basis would
	<br><blockquote><p>"make the employer's task much more complicated",</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>I was advised at the time.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Under the calendar quarter method once an employee has received payments for 5 days he will get no more guarantee until the next quarter starts",</p></blockquote>
If part of the Government's case for the change is that we chose some rather odd quarters, I reply that the reason for choosing the particular quarter dates specified in the Act was to
	<br><blockquote><p>"avoid the end of a guarantee period of entitlement coinciding as far as possible with Christmas, Easter and summer holidays",</p></blockquote>
which would create difficulties for benefit offices.</p>
	<p>However, since we commenced our proceedings, the Low Pay Unit, in its very helpful briefing which I think has been sent to all members of the Committee, has advanced yet a further argument, and a strong argument, against the change that is proposed in the Bill. I quote from its briefing, which says that the proposed change will hit the group most vulnerable to short-time working and stoppages, the low paid, who
	<br><blockquote><p>"will thus have their statutory rights further reduced."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to argue that
	<br><blockquote><p>"this change will have its most significant impact on non-unionised employees and will compound the problems faced by the low paid …</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>We stress the importance of these changes for the low paid. Low pay tends to be one element of a wider matrix of labour market disadvantage. Those who find themselves amongst the low paid (in manual or lower grade clerical jobs) are more vulnerable both to unemployment and short-time working."</p></blockquote>
I do not think that that is open to question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"Low pay and earnings instability often go hand in hand …When the Employment Protection Act extended guaranteed weekly pay to the entire population, this was welcomed by the Unit as a means of helping break through the web of labour market disadvantage in which this group "—</p></blockquote>
the low paid—
	<br><blockquote><p>"were entangled. We referred to Department of Employment findings that low paying industries were over-represented amongst those most affected by stoppages and short-time working: 'of industrial groupings on short-time working in June 1974 six out of the bottom ten manufacturing industries ranked according to average earnings have above
	<span class='label label-info column'>1282</span>
average proportions of operatives on short-time '.(The Rights of Lower Paid Workers, Low Pay Unit, 1974). Once more, the proposals of the present Government to reduce the effectiveness of these provisions will affect the low paid disproportionately."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>Then the unit draws our attention to the Institute of Personnel Management, which said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"although it may seem logical to adopt a rolling period approach to guarantee pay, the Institute strongly opposes the intention expressed in the Consultative Documents in so far as it would have the effect of worsening blue collar conditions of service vis-a-vis white collar employees."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>The unit concludes its submission by drawing attention yet again to the surveys carried out by the Department of Employment. The research indicates that the provisions of the Employment Protection Act 1978 which we are discussing in this Bill have been troublesome to only a very few employers. The Policy Studies Institute study of 301 randomly selected manufacturing firms with work forces ranging from 50 to 5,000 people found that when asked about guarantee pay provisions only 3 per cent. of respondents said that the measures had had a substantial impact, and 7 per cent. attributed a minor effect. The figures for those plants experiencing falling or variable demand were slightly different: 5 per cent. attributed a "good deal of effect " and 6 per cent. reported a minor impact.</p>
	<p>Similarly, the Department's research on employment legislation and firms employing fewer than 50 people, as in the Opinion Research Centre study, reported that 8 per cent. had paid workers temporarily laid off but only I per cent.—three firms—had found it troublesome. The unit is therefore doubtful whether there is adequate justification for the changes embodied in the Bill.</p>
	<p>In the absence of any explanation, unless the hon, and learned Gentleman can be persuaded that we and the Low Pay Unit have got it wrong, I must ask my right hon. Friend and my hon. Friends divide the Committee on this clause.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my eager anticipation to hear the Minister, my main concern is to hear the evidence that he will put before us as to why the clause is necessary. We have heard conclusive evidence from surveys that only a miniscule proportion of firms found these provisions troublesome. I shall wait to hear any evidence to the contrary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only criticism I have heard of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1190">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1283</span>
existing provisions on guarantee payment is that they are inadequate. They amount to £8 per day, which is lower than the supplementary benefit level. We are talking about a very low level of payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are doing a very mean and petty thing, taking away very inadequate provision without there being any evidence that it is proving troublesome to British industry. We all know what is causing trouble to British industry. We have heard from my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) of the surveys quoted, and I am waiting with bated breath to hear whether there is evidence that we have not heard of, or whether Conservative hon. Members can produce letters from their postbags giving contrary evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) has fairly reminded the Committee of our discussions in the Committee on the 1975 Employment Protection Bill. It is worth amplifying the points that he made then. He rightly reminds the Committee that the Opposition sought to change the Bill to effect the same provision as clause 12 now seeks to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Silvester) who moved the amendment then, on 19 June. The right hon. Gentleman said—I paraphrase a little but I promise not to cheat—that the Government had carefully looked at the matter, but he did not wish to suggest that they could recommend acceptance. He acknowledged, however, that my hon. Friend had a sound argument. The right hon. Gentleman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"After careful consideration we arrived at the position formulated in the Bill.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>We think that the practical difficulties for employers in keeping the necessary records, if we went along the road suggested by the hon. Gentleman, would be enormous. It would lead to delays in the payment of guarantee payments or to disputes over entitlement. We believe that the fixed calendar quarterly period is much simpler to understand and administer. That is our assessment. We believe that the kind of problem which the hon. Gentleman envisages is unlikely to arise in practice.".</p></blockquote>
That is what the right hon. Gentleman said four years ago.
	<br><blockquote><p>"On the balance of the considerations of the two ways of doing this, we arrived at our formulation having regard to the administrative burden which would accrue to the employers.".—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 19 June 1975; c. 610.]</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1284</span>
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the right hon. Gentleman was perfectly entitled to keep the advice that he was given by officials of his Department at that time and to remind us of it. But the significant thing is that when my hon. Friend moved the very same amendment as is now given effect in this clause it was consideration for the employer's convenience and ability to run his firm that moved the Government to reject it. What the right hon. Gentleman said later, if I may paraphrase, was that he did not think it particularly likely that the 10-day liability to pay guarantee pay—the roll-over provision, allowing for 10 days to be payable one after the other—was likely to arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair to say that the CBI at that time, on balance, preferred the risk of paying 10 days' guarantee pay in quick succession to the greater administrative burden of running a rolling period scheme. I think that that is right, and that is probably why the right hon. Gentleman came to that conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, by the same token, we have thought it right to take advice in the light of different conditions. The events of the last few years have shown that paying 10 days' guarantee pay in quick succession is much more than a risk—it is a reality. We therefore thought it worthwhile to put these questions forth in our working papers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was very wide support for the proposal in this clause, which, after all, is only to do this so that one is not liable to pay guarantee pay, or five days' guarantee pay, more than once in any period of three months. It was common ground in 1975 and it is common ground in this Committee that five days should be the relevant period—the maximum period in any time of three months. The sole question is whether there should be a rolling period or whether we should retain the fixed quarters that were put into the 1975 Act, for the reasons referred to by the right hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been asked what the evidence is. The Birmingham Chamber of Industry and Commerce agreed with the proposal. The Engineering Employers Federation agreed with the proposal. The Unquoted Companies Group supported it. The Teesside Small Business Club supported it. The CBI agreed with it. The British Institute of Management agreed with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The TUC disagreed with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1191">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1285</span>
it. The Institute of Personnel Management disagreed with it, for the reasons that have been given today. The Association of British Chambers of Commerce agreed. So did the Federation of Master Builders, the Forum of Private Business, the Derby and Derbyshire Chamber of Commerce, and those who responded to the working papers. With the exception of the Institute of Personnel Management and the TUC, I believe I am right in saying that no response to the working papers was adverse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Low Pay Unit opposed it because it said that it would hit hardest those on low pay, but the point to be made is this. Certainly, one is worse off if one is unable in a period of 10 days to get guaranteed pay for each of those 10 days. But by the same token so is the employer—in many cases a small employer-—prejudiced if he had to meet within 10 days liability for two tranches of five days each of guarantee pay.

	<p>what employers thought was on balance desirable that we have asked the same question. We have had a degree of unanimity that is very high and about which I have reminded the Committee. In those circumstances, we are entitled, we think, to make the change in this Bill that we advocated five years ago, because the circumstances have changed. I do not criticise right hon Gentlemen for having followed the view of the CBI five years ago, deciding the matter on the balance of convenience for employers. Today we are applying the same test, and we have had a very strong steer in favour of the proposal which we set out in our working papers. For that reason, I feel it right to advise my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Goodhew. May I seek your guidance? Would it be in order for me to seek to move a change in the order in which we are considering the clauses in order to defer our consideration of clause 14 and deal with some other clauses in the meanwhile?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I, with your kind indulgence, Mr. Goodhew, explain the thought behind that request? Clause 14 covers very much the same ground as the Government's working paper. Indeed, the clause and the working paper are not merely interlinked but are intertwined. It will be impossible to discuss clause 14 without also discussing the working paper. Undoubtedly, that will figure strongly in our discussion. But we are aware that the process of consultation which the Government are undertaking on the working paper is not quite complete. It will be completed in a few days, when the Government will table a new clause or new clauses covering the same ground as the working paper, and therefore covering something of the same ground as clause 14.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until we see what that new clause or those new clauses are, we have no means of knowing to what extent all that we may say in the course of debate about clause 14 may be outdated when the new clause or new clauses come. It would seem much more sensible to defer consideration of clause 14 until the publication of the new clause or new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are ample precedents. I have taken part in other Standing Committees where there has been a change in the order in which clauses are considered. I should be grateful, Mr. Goodhew, if you would be kind enough to tell me whether I should be in order in seeking, for the reasons I have sought to give, a deferment of our discussion on clause 14.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This would not only be unnecessary but would prevent the debating of clause 14 until Report. That would be highly undesirable by itself, even if it were necessary. The Committee will recall that this Bill has from publication proposed that a restriction of immunity in respect of actions committed in the course of picketing should be dealt with separately especially. That finds its expression in clause 14.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government indicated in their statement a few weeks ago, made by my right hon. Friend, that they proposed to introduce a new clause which would deal with the question of trade union immunity from actions at civil law in respect of tort within the context of industrial action other than picketing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) rightly says, the Government are at present consulting about that. But it is incorrect to say that it is impossible to deal with the provisions of this clause, which relates solely to picketing, in advance of seeing the new clause. Not only is it not impossible for the Committee to deal with properly but, in the Government's view, the Committee will not be inconvenienced in so doing in any way. We believe that the balance of advantage for the Committee overwhelmingly lies in discussing this Bill in the order which you have selected to take, Mr. Goodhew. I must therefore advise my right hon. and hon. Friends to resist the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I accept that it would be possible to discuss the two separately, I think that the hon. and learned Gentleman is being less than frank—I am rather surprised, as he is usually very frank with the Committee—when he suggests that there is little connection between the two. Obviously, if the suggestions con-

tained in the working paper were to become law they would substantially affect picketing and restrict the so—called golden formula which would in turn have an effect on picketing. So it is quite wrong to say that they are not connected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the vote went against us, I would hope that it would be in order to refer to the working paper, because they are so closely connected. It is not possible to dis-cuss the Government's intentions in clause 14 without also referring to the working paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) has highlighted the difficulties that we are labouring under in this Committee. We want to refer during our discussions on clause 14 to the working paper issued on the 19 February by the Secretary of State. We know that any amendments to the Bill arising out of that working paper will not arrive until some time after Easter. We hope that if we have discussions on clause 14, Mr. Goodhew, you will bear in mind the point made by my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in some difficulty because on Second Reading the Secretary of State said that the Government would have to return to secondary action at some later stage, arising from the Express Newspapers v. Macshane case, and it was argued that if that were to be done it should be done by separate legislation. My right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) took that up on behalf of the Opposition when winding up that debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While it would in some respects be best if we could defer consideration of clause 14 until a later stage when we shall know precisely what further amendments the Government intend to put down to this Bill covering secondary action, we hope, Mr. Goodhew, that in the way you conduct our proceedings you will rule that we can discuss secondary action and the working paper, because we regard it as being part and parcel of the Bill and that may be the only opportunity when we have a chance of exploring it fully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are entitled to a much more adequate explanation than the Under-Secretary has given us so far. Although it is true that the working paper deals with industrial action of kinds other than picketing, it certainly must deal with
	<span class='label label-info column'>1290</span>
picketing as well in the sense that the greater includes the less. For example, there are references on page 4 to "any industrial action". All the way through it deals with "any industrial action", and there is no point in the paper where it excludes picketing. Therefore, it is not possible to deal with clause 14 without reference to this working paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 12 of the working paper refers specifically to picketing, so I do not see any reason why we should not, subject to your ruling, Mr. Goodhew.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Anything that is relevant to a matter before the Committee will be in order for debate, so I do not anticipate any great difficulty there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that assurance, Mr. Goodhew. I should have been surprised if you had said otherwise. But I am concerned that we should have a better explanation of why the Government are now resisting what has been moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo), because what he says is absolutely right. We cannot have a debate on clause 14 conditioned by the certain knowledge that something else will happen after we have done with the clause. That would be particularly unfortunate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For precisely the reasons advanced by the hon. Gentleman, I support my hon. and learned Friend in resisting this suggestion. I very much hope that in the course of discussing clause 14 and its ramifications the Government will hear arguments which will condition the clause which may in due course be tabled and to which reference has already been made. Since there is a consultative process going on at the moment, I hope that our deliberations on clause 14 may be a contribution to that rather than an impediment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light not of anything said by the hon. and learned Gentleman but of what you yourself said, Mr. Goodhew, in regard to the scope of the debate, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

amendment No. 163, in page 13, line 38, after " work", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"or a place of work either or other workers who are parties to the trade dispute or occupied or used by any person who is giving or is likely to give aid or support of an employer party to the trade dispute whether by way of trade, business relationships, arrangements for insurance against loss, or in any other manner whatsoever directly or indirectly".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>No. 165, in page 13, line 41, at end insert

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The little skirmish that we have just had is an indication of the importance of the clause in the context of the Bill and in terms of its impact on the conduct of industrial relations if it is subsequently enacted. The document pubblished by the TUC about the Bill says about clause 14 that this provision is a major threat to trade unions. That is true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I welcome to our proceedings the learned Attorney-General. I think I can be sufficiently presumptuous to speak on behalf of the whole Committee. We are very glad that he has responded to our request that he attend our proceedings and give us the benefit of his knowledge on these matters and perhaps give us some guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the Bill was published a number of difficulties have been put in the way of our
	<span class='label label-info column'>1292</span>
consideration of and preparation of amendments to the clause, one of which has been referred to—the publication of the working paper relating to immunities and secondary action. I hope that I may be allowed to say a little more about that in a moment. The other is the statement by the Attorney-General on 19 February to the House about picketing and the criminal law. In reply to my hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Lyon) on that occasion the Attorney-General said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"So far as I can see, the only way in which the immunities given in the existing law on picketing change the criminal law is that it permits an obstruction of the highway. That is not a serious obstruction. The law permits one to stand on the pavement or in the road outside the place of work where ordinarily one would not be permitted to do so because the highway is meant for passing and repassing. That, I think, is the limit."</p></blockquote>
Then he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is only to that extent that the immunity would be removed if clause 14 became effective." —[	<i>Official Report,</i> 19 February 1980; Vol. 979, c. 255.]</p></blockquote>
I mention that because the Secretary of State has, from the outset of our discussions on this Bill, insisted repeatedly that clause 14 in no way impinges on the criminal law. On Second Reading, in an intervention in the speech of my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley), the Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This has absolutely nothing to do with the police. It has nothing to do with criminal law. It is entirely a matter for the person who believes that his contracts are in some way being broken to take action through the civil court. The police are in no way involved in this."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 December 1979; Vol. 976, c. 75–76.]</p></blockquote>
Here is the Secretary or State repeatedly insisting that the provisions of clause 14 do not impinge in any way on the criminal law, but the Attorney-General on 19 February of this year told the House of Commons that they did. That is one good reason why I am glad to see both the Secretary of State and the Attorney-General sitting side by side, shoulder to shoulder, so that they can tell us whether there are more points at which there is some impingement and some infringement, or whether it is merely that it is an area of error on the part of the Secretary of State. I hope that we may have some clarification about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before going on to the substance of the amendment may I take up the theme that has already marked the start of our pro-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1195">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1293</span>
ceedings on clause 14—the interface between the working paper on immunities and secondary action and clause 14. It is a remarkable coincidence that it was on 19 February—the very day when the Attorney-General was making his unsolicited statement to the House on picketing and the criminal law—that the Secretary of State was publishing his working paper. It may have been just a coincidence; it may not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me stress that the clause that we are about to debate, and the amendments to it, are directly linked to section 13 of the 1974 Act. Section 13 is what the working paper intends to change. There is an interaction between the two things. The Government, in the working paper published last year, clearly recognised that. I wish that the Government would index this seemingly endless flow of papers on these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The paper of 19 February says, in paragraph 2, that the Government have the law on immunities under review. They have already consulted on the appropriate limitation of the immunities in relation to secondary picketing, and have made provision for this in clause 14. In the Government's view, recent interpretation and application of the law demonstrate the need for immediate amendment of the law on immunities as it applies to other secondary action, such as picketing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two issues—blacking and picketing—are not so separate as the Government seem to think. They are often part and parcel of the same industrial action, as I hope to illustrate as I go on. The interface is further confirmed by the Government when they say in their proposals for diminishing the immunities in section 13 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 that it is of great importance to trade unionists, because almost any industrial action involves a person, usually a trade union official, in inducing others to break their contract of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only is that as true of picketing as it is of any other industrial action, but picketing can induce a breach of a commercial contract. Indeed, it may often be aimed deliberately at doing just that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to inflict any more lengthy quotations on the Committee, but I urge hon. Members to look at paragraph 11 of the earlier working paper issued by
	<span class='label label-info column'>1294</span>
the Government last year, which deals with picketing and from which spring the provisions of clause 14. They say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An alternative approach will be to limit the immunity conferred by section 13 in respect of all forms of industrial action. In practice, picketing of employers, for example, with whom the pickets are not in dispute usually involves interference with commercial contracts and the same is true of other forms of so-called secondary action—for example, blacking."</p></blockquote>
So they themselves clearly recognise what has been advanced earlier from the Opposition side of the Committee—that these two things are interrelated and cannot be considered separately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to argue our amendments properly, we need to know which particular section 13 they will eventuallly interact with. Is it the section 13 embodies in the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act, or will it be an entirely separate section 13, such as is contemplated in the Secretary of State's working paper?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which these matters bear directly upon the substance of the amendment that I have moved can be easily illustrated. Let us suppose, for example, that an employer in dispute with his workers, where there is a strike, is sending work out. He cannot get it done within his own establishment because the chaps who would normally do it are on strike. Let us suppose that it is an engineering firm, and the boss is sending castings out for processing or machining to some other firm with spare capacity. He does it on the quiet. He does not advertise it to the world. The load is slipping out of the back door or is delivered from the foundry. Instead of coming to his place, it goes to the other bloke's place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Have not the workers on strike any right to picket the chaps at the second firm? The chaps at the end second firm may be totally unaware, even though they may be members of the same branch of the same union, that they are carrying out work for a firm where their mates are on strike—that, in short, they are blacking. In those circumstances, ought the chaps on strike to have the right to tell the chaps who are doing the black work that they are doing precisely that? Apparently not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not arguing about whether the chaps who are carrying out the work should be prevented from doing it. That is not what we are talking about. We are talking about picketing within the existing law—peacefully communicating and peacefully persuading. First, should the chaps who
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1196">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1295</span>
are doing the black work—the work of their mates on strike—have the right to be told? Secondly, should the blokes at the firm in dispute have the right to tell in turn?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not so as the Bill stands. Our amendment would make it possible. But then it would be blocked by the proposals in the new working paper. So the redress that we seek to give workers who we feel are being unfairly deprived of the right would be immediately thwarted and we would be wasting our time by the provisions of the new working paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While it is so that, in the circumstances just described, the Bill would make it unlawful for the employees of the firm in dispute to picket at the other firm which is now taking on work which would be regarded by trade unions as black, that would be made lawful by the provisions in the working paper relating to first customers and first suppliers. Quite clearly, in those circumstances, the firm which has taken on this work from the firm hit by the dispute at that point becomes certainly a first supplier and possibly a first customer, whichever way the terms of the contract were drawn. Without a doubt it would be first customer or first supplier, and in those circumstances action against it, if made lawful by the provisions in the working paper, will show a number of contradictions between the Bill and the working paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in an enormously difficult and complex area. The word is quagmire—or "minefield" may be more appropriate. I make no pretence of any deep understanding of these matters. I am glad that we have the Attorney-General and the hon. and learned Gentleman on the Government Front Bench to take us through this minefield. I said last week that we needed the combined navigational talents of Vasco da Gama, Marco Polo and half the NASA authorities in the United States to understand one clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend should not forget Thomas Cook!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a relatively simple matter compared with what is involved here. The shop stewards—chaps who know all about how to handle metals, how to make motor cars and so on, but who know precious little of the law—who have
	<span class='label label-info column'>1296</span>
to live and work within this law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw to the attention of my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) paragraph 17 of the document of 19 February, where we have an addition to those provisions to which he referred:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the inducement to break or interfere with any commercial contract arose in connection with industrial action, threatened or actual, taken in furtherance of a trade dispute by employees of the employer in dispute, the person inducing the breach or interference would continue to have immunity under section 13.".</p></blockquote>
The situation that I have described to illustrate the difficulty we are in is the nub of that difficulty. Even if we persuade the Committee that it would be right to allow workers, in the situation I have described, to communicate with fellow workers at the second firm, they are then likely to fall foul of the new law, because, if successful, they would almost certainly be inducing a breach of commercial contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Attorney-General is looking thoughtful. Perhaps he will tell me whether I am right or wrong when he contributes to our proceedings. It seems to be a very real possibility. It would need only one such successful action arising from such a situation to reveal the extent to which workers and their organisations would be put back in the Taff Vale type situation of the turn of the century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to say more about the amendments in the context of the Bill as drafted. Amendments Nos. 163, 165 and 167 deal essentially with the same points, whilst amendment No. 173 seeks to give a sharper definition to the words "place of work". My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) is better equipped to deal with the legal aspects of that than I, and I very much hope that he may seek to catch your eye, Mr. Goodhew, in the course of our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The earlier amendments demonstrate that the Bill fails to recognise the reality of the structure of industry and commerce and fails to reflect the real nature of the way in which industrial relations are conducted in this country. I have already cited the firm that sends work out during a dispute. What about a situation in which a firm brings in subcontract workers, the labour being only subcontractors. Why should it be actionable peacefully to communicate with them or to try to persuade the workers of the subcontracting firm that they should not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1197">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1297</span>
betray the interests of their fellow workers? What would be the position of the usually mobile worker?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Notwithstanding what I said about my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Accrington, and putting aside for a moment the oft-quoted example of lorry drivers, there will be many workers whose employment will pose difficulties if they find themselves in disputes following enactment of this clause. For example, the possibility of a rail strike seems to me to be not an unlikely supposition. According to the Bill the only place railway men may be able to picket is the British Rail headquarters in Marylebone Road. They might be chancing their arm if they picketed anywhere else. But presumably when they go along to picket Peter Parker's place at Marylebone Road they will be guilty of a mass demonstration and be denounced for such in the press.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there are the dock workers within the area of a local dock labour board, those whose contract of employment requires them to work anywhere within the board's jurisdiction. The whole of the London docks is under one dock labour board. Where will dockers be entitled to picket—outside the offices of the board but nowhere else? Where do London bus drivers picket? I am not quite sure where the headquarters of London Transport is, but I presume that that would be the only place they would be allowed to picket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not started to touch on the problems that may arise in an organisation such as British Leyland, with its multi-factory structure, or Ford's Dagenham estate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Have I yet mentioned so-called ghost-picketing? What is the position when pickets merely leave their placards outside the premises that are being picketed, without any physical and personal presence? Lorry drivers often obey placards saying "Official dispute".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is the part of our amendment No. 163 which refers to employers' arrangements. I have not invoked all the emotional arguments about the traditional solidarity of working people. I am sure that my hon. Friends will know what I am referring to when I mention the Joe Hill syndrome. Joe Hill said: "When working men are out on strike Joe Hill is by their side." We have the employers openly organising a solidarity which many of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1298</span>
us have long suspected existed in their ranks—the CBI strike fund, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government talk about the impact of industrial disputes on the innocent neutral third parties who are hit by picketing and secondary activities. I wonder how neutral and innocent is a third party who actively supports a fellow employer by providing cash or strike fund money, or perhaps in other ways. Is it so wrong that workers in dispute should be able to communicate with and peacefully persuade the employees of such an employer that solidarity is a working-class tenet just as much as a bosses' tenet?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has mentioned a number of industries. Will he give his attention to an example in the printing industry? There was once a dispute to obtain a 40-hour week, and there was a dispute in a publication called 	<i>TV Times.</i> The workers involved were on strike and picketing their place of work. The employer then found other premises where he could print the 	<i>TV Times.</i> The workers who had been employed on that publication, having learnt where it was being printed, then picketed the other establishment. They were not picketing their own place of work; they were picketing their own job. How would they stand under the provision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that whoever replies on behalf of the Government will tell my hon. Friend that such action in future would not be permissible; it would be exposed to action in the civil courts following enactment of clause 14. It will doubtless be confirmed that that is the Government's intention. But I shall leave that to them. I am quite sure that when we come to a more general debate my hon. Friend, who has enormous knowledge of printing, will want to say something about how these provisions will impinge on industrial relations in the printing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I say something more about the question of the interface between clause 14 and our amendments and the new working paper. I want to cite as an example of the kind of problems that will emerge the case of the seagoing vessel the "Nawala", which was recently the subject of a judgment in the House of Lords, sitting in its appellate capacity. In order to give the Committee some idea of the kind of problem, I shall quote to the Committee only the descrip-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1198">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1299</span>
tive passages of their Lordships' judgment:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Nawala is a large bulk-carrier with a capacity of more than 120,000 tonnes dwt. She was built in Germany in 1974 for Scandinavian shipowners and entered on the Norwegian registry. She was manned by a Norwegian crew at rates of wages that had been negotiated by their national trade union and are among the highest current in European countries. When the slump in the freight market came she was trading under the Norwegian flag but at a loss. Her owners were unable to meet the mortgage payments and sold her to buyers based in Sweden, who for the purpose of transferring her to Hong Kong registry formed a Hong Kong company of whose shares a Swedish company was the beneficial owner. The Hong Kong company became the nominal owner of the vessel, and a Hong Kong crew was engaged at very much lower wages to take the place of the Norwegian crew. It was not necessary for the Nawala to visit Hong Kong in order to effect the change of flag or to engage the Hong Kong crew. The crew was engaged there by an agency that was officially licensed in the colony to do so. The crew signed their articles there and were flown to Hamburg where they joined the vessel. The Nawala, under her new flag and manned by her new and much lower paid crew, was engaged by her new owners upon chartered voyages world-wide."</p></blockquote>
What the owners had done was to change the registration. When, in the anodyne words of their Lordships, the Hong Kong crew is said to have been flown out to take the place of the Norwegian crew, we must not overlook the fact that the Norwegian crew had been dismissed in order to bring in cheap labour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what we are talking about—sacking blokes who have organised themselves and negotiated decent terms and conditions of employment so that they can be replaced with cheap Oriental labour from the British colony of Hong Kong. So,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Nawala, under her new flag and manned by her new and much lower paid crew, was engaged by her new owners upon chartered voyages worldwide. Early in 1979 she had berthed at Redcar with a cargo of Australian iron ore for British Steel. A representative of ITF"—</p></blockquote>
the International Transport workers Federation, an international trade union—
	<br><blockquote><p>"boarded her and demanded of the master that he sign on behalf of the shipowners an agreement with ITF that they would enter into articles with the crew on standard ITF terms. The demand was refused. When she arrived at Redcar on her next consecutive voyage with a similar cargo on 15th June 1979, Mr. Woods, who was an official of both ITF and the English National Seamen's Union, repeated the demand and said that if it were not complied with the Nawala would be ' blacked ' by the port workers. He and later Mr. Nelson and Mr. Laughton attempted to persuade port workers who belonged to other unions affiliated to ITF to refuse to allow her to enter a berth, to unload her if she got there or to let her leave it. In the result these attempts, when
	<span class='label label-info column'>1300</span>
they were resumed after the interlocutory injunction granted by Donaldson J. had been lifted by Lord Salmon and Stephenson J. on 21 June 1979, were unsuccessful because they were resisted by the trade unions to which the port workers belonged. So the Nawala succeeded in unloading her cargo and sailed away from Redcar to Narvik to load a cargo of Norwegian iron ore for carriage to the Netherlands."</p></blockquote>
It will be noted that when the trade union officials were trying to persuade the port workers to refuse to offload the vessels, doubtless they were seeking to induce a breach of commercial contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the saga of the Nawala:
	<br><blockquote><p>"She was off Narvik waiting for a berth when the shipowners' appeal against the refusal of Donaldson J. of an interlocutory injunction against the defendants Nelson and Laughton was heard by the Court of Appeal, and 1TF had by telegrams despatched from London and a personal visit by the defendant Nelson persuaded the national trade union there, the Scandinavian Transport Workers' Federation to black her."</p></blockquote>
So she was blacked in Norway. A subsequent injunction in Norway was successful in having the blacking lifted there.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The stop press news, received on 26th July, the last day of the hearing before this House, was that the Dutch trade unions of which port workers at Ijmuiden were members were threatening to black the Nawala there."</p></blockquote>
That illustrates what is going on in international seafaring. Western trade unions, having negotiated decent terms and conditions of employment, could have those efforts thwarted and frustrated by the owners reregistering their vessel under what is called a flag of convenience, dismissing the crew and taking on cheap labour. We are talking now of the efforts to organise those workers to prevent that kind of thing happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Happily, for the moment, the Nawala judgment went in favour of the trade unions, but the Nawala was not the first, nor will it be the last, of such cases. How would it be under the new proposals? First, for the trade unions to avoid being taken to the cleaners for damages under the provisions of the new working paper they would have to satisfy the proposed tests of capability and motive. The question that would have to be answered is whether the union's action was reasonably capable of furthering the trade dispute and whether it was to be taken predominantly in pursuit of that trade dispute and not principally for some extraneous motive, such as objecting to flags of convenience. Was there then a trade dispute?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1199">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1301</span>
In this case the workers, because they could not understand English—a Chinese crew, not one of whom could understand a word of English—could not communicate and therefore could not say whether they were satisfied or dissatisfied with their terms and conditions of employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Nawala raises many interesting and important issues of international trade union law and practice But is it not the case—the hon. Gentleman must be very familiar with this—that the crew that was brought onto the Nawala was paid very good and absolutely normal wages for a Hong Kong crew and was very glad to have the work? Is this not a dispute between the position in the Far East and that in Europe, where terms and conditions are very different?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the point that I am making. If a group of workers in Britain has successfully, through its organisation, negotiated reasonable and decent terms and conditions of employment, and is then peremptorily sacked and replaced by a group of people who are brought in, whose native circumstances and environment make them deeply grateful for anything that is a fraction of the British workers', is that something to give cause for congratulation and support or is it something that we should condemn? The hon. Gentleman has already indicated in the course of our proceedings that that is a perfectly proper thing to do. I argue that it is a perfectly improper thing to do, and I seek to draw my speech to a conclusion by making exactly that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key passage, in the working paper of 19 February in the context of the remarks that I have just made, is that in order to continue to qualify for immunity, any inducement, to break or interfere with any commercial contract must have arisen
	<br><blockquote><p>"in connection with industrial action, threatened or actual, taken in furtherance of a trade dispute by 	<i>employees of the employer in dispute".</i></p></blockquote>
That emphasis is not mine. The words
	<br><blockquote><p>"employees of the employer in dispute"</p></blockquote>
are underlined by the Secretary of State in his document. There is no evidence that the Chinese crew of the Nawala, working for a fraction of the internationally recognised rates, were in dispute with their employer. But there is no evidence to the contrary
	<span class='label label-info column'>1302</span>
either. As I have said, they cannot communicate; they cannot speak English.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that the crew were not in dispute, but that they were, undeniably, undercutting the rates for other seafarers. Have not those other seafarers the right to protest and to seek to take action? I am talking about action within the law. Have they no right to express concern about the exploitation of cheap labour? Certainly in our British law—in our domestic law, through the wages council system—we have long recognised that such a state of affairs is unacceptable in a decent society, and we have domestic legislation to protect people against such exploitation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Lyell) seems to think that it is all right so long as the people are Chinese or Indian, or workers from other parts of the Orient—unless he thinks that British workers should not have the protection of wages councils and the concept behind them. Any action to black such a vessel or any attempt to bring pressure to bear on the owners will invite crippling legal retaliation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That in itself would be bad enough—that shipowners, some of them British, should engage in a twentieth-century slave trade without British workers being allowed to refuse to unload such vessels. British workers will have to allow themselves to be party to such exploitation, to do otherwise might land them in the courts. But the Bill proposes additionally to expose to damages anyone who seeks to communicate with that Asian crew, or any other, to persuade them that what they are doing is wrong, or peacefully to persuade them to press for decent pay and conditions of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On pain of legal penalties the dockers are compelled, however abhorrent it may be to them, to offload such a vessel and—what is equally abhorrent—under this measure the workers' organisations are to be refused access to the sailors who are being exploited. By this measure and by his other proposals the Secretary of State is not just condoning the kind of sweated labour that we prohibit by our domestic law but is actually conniving at its continuation and extension by providing savage penalties for those who, in the most modest way, try to do something about it. He and those who support him should be ashamed.

I have detained the Committee long enough. I have touched only peripherally on what is an enormously important

subject—one that will be, in the words of the Trades Union Congress, a major threat to trade unions. It may be advisable if I allow my hon. Friends to extend the case that I have unfolded only a little.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members may have thought that amendment No. 173 was one of those obscure, erudite legal amendments, debate on which would be confined to exchanges between myself and the Minister. In fact, the amendment goes

to the heart of the clause. It seeks to give a legal definition to the phrase "place of work". That phrase appears in the Bill in a major sense. As the Committee will understand—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
