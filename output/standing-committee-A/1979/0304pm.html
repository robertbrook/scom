<p><i>Amendment proposed</i> [<i>this day</i>], <i>No.</i> 88, in page 8, line 19, leave out "80 per cent." and insert "two-thirds."—[<i>Mr. Harold Walker.</i>]</p>
<p>4.34 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are discussing amendment No. 89, in page 8, line 20, leave out "entitled to vote" and insert "voting".<br><br>
The Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. James Prior): I have been asked a number of questions by the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker), and I shall try to answer them.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman made great play about the fact that if there was a conflict on the shop floor, it would have to be determined by the courts. He said that this was a fertile ground for litigants. In my view, there is no need for concern here. Section 3(4) of the 1976 Act says:
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of this Act employees are to be treated, in relation to a union membership agreement, as belonging to the same elass if they have been identified as such by the parties to the agreement, and employees may be so identified by reference to any characteristics or circumstances whatsoever."</p></blockquote>
That means, in my opinion, that it is a matter on the shop floor for the employer and the union—or, if more than one union is concerned, the unions—to agree among themselves who should be identified as belonging to the same class by the parties to the agreement, which must be the unions involved and the employer, and the employees may be so identified by reference to any characteristics or circumstances whatsoever. That is the situation that will persist. In my view,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 876</span>
therefore, this can in no circumstances be the subject of litigation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What would happen in the event of failure to agree?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing at the moment which can force one party to a union membership agreement to agree. If the employer is so determined, he cannot be forced to agree to a union membership agreement. A lot of pressure may be put on him by a union. The union may go on strike or take certain action in support of its desire. But there is nothing in law which can actually force an employer to make a union membership agreement. In certain circumstances he might be unwise not to make a union membership agreement, but there is nothing that can force him to do so.<br><br>
Another question was whether the employer would be able to veto a ballot which excluded some and not others. Really the answer is the same. Yes, of course. A ballot will take place on a union membership agreement, and if the employer does not agree, there is no union membership agreement. It is as straightforward as that. It is a risk that the employer has to take.<br><br>
Another question asked by the right hon. Gentleman was whether it was right that those who voted "No" nevertheless had absolute protection? In the circumstances that we are laying down, if the people who vote "No" are existing employees—in other words, if they are not members at the relevant time—they do not have to join a union. That is the rule that we are laying down for the existing work force.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman then asked "What will the questions be?" The Bill leaves it to the parties to decide the actual questions. The ballot must be held on the principle of whether there is to be a closed shop—that is to say, that employees be required, subject to the statutory provisions of any additional protection given in the union membership agreement, to join the specified union or unions.<br><br>
Again, the right hon. Gentleman asked "Who will agree who the employees affected are? Will we reach the stage of some employees in the shop being members of the AU EW and some being members of the sheet metal workers' union or some other union?" That is entirely a matter
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0973">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 877</span>
for the union membership agreement to define. The portion of the I976 amendment Act that I quoted would cover the operation of the union membership agreement in that respect.<br><br>
That matters that the right hon. Gentleman raised have proved useful subjects of discussion. But I do not believe that they will in any way trouble the parties who have to seek a union membership agreement in conducting their affairs without resort to litigation. Again, I stress the importance that we attach to the need for a ballot of all those involved in a group of workers before a closed shop comes into operation. It makes such a change in the circumstances of those involved at their place of work that there ought to be a secret ballot and an overwhelming majority, which we have stated as being 80 per cent. voting in favour of those affected, before a closed shop can be brought in.<br><br>
I think that I have answered the right hon. Gentleman's questions. I hope that in view of the assurance which I have been able to give him, he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Secretary of State two questions. He has referred to the need for overwhelming support for new union agreements. How overwhelming is overwhelming? Where does he get the figure of 80 per cent.? Is this figure plucked out of the air, or is there some rationale for it? I have never seen it used before.<br><br>
I think that the provision in the 1971 Act for an overwhelming majority was two-thirds of those voting. That has been changed since 1971, and I should like to know why the change has been made and why this figure of 80 per cent. is now proposed.<br><br>
After all, we continually hear the Prime Minister refer to her great majority on 3 May, which puts right hon. and hon. Gentlemen where they are and enables them to bring forward this legislation. I think that they received just over 30 per cent. of the votes of those entitled to vote. Yet the right hon. Lady often refers to that figure of just over 30 per cent. as overwhelming.<br><br>
A clue to the figure of 80 per cent. might come from what we did in the devolution referendums in Scotland and Wales. A very controversial amendment to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 878</span>
the Bill was moved by a Back Bencher that, for the referendum to be successful, 40 per cent. of those entitled to vote should vote in favour. Numerous people then said that this was outrageous. How on earth could one expect 40 per cent. of those entitled to vote in favour of something? We know that that amendment effectively stymied the devolution proposals, because, although there was a majority, it was not 40 per cent. of those entitled to vote. I wonder whether the Secretary of State thought that, because 40 per cent. there was impossible, he would double it and make it 80 per cent.<br><br>
We all have fresh in our minds the stupendous victory of Mr. Mugabe. I do not want to refer too much to that, but I have been looking in the newspapers, and I find a string of superlatives—" massive", "huge", "sweeping", "landslide". Yet even the amazing Mr. Mugabe never got 80 per cent. of the votes of those entitled to vote. If the Secretary of State got 60 per cent. of the votes of those entitled to vote in his constituency, I am certain that he would say that that was an overwhelming majority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether I can help the hon. Gentleman. I believe that the overall figure obtained by the Conservative Party at the last election was 40 per cent. The hon. Gentleman is always very fond, as are his hon. Friends, of saying that industrial relations cannot be compared with other activities: they are very special and very sensitive. Perhaps I can offer him the thought that, if 40 per cent. was reasonable in other circumstances, we should be doubly sure now and make it 80 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we doubled the percentage of those entitled to vote who voted Conservative on 3 May last, it would not reach the figure of 80 per cent. If the hon. Gentleman's logic were pursued, he ought to move an amendment to reduce the figure from 80 per cent.<br><br>
Very few Members in the House could say that they had an absolute majority of those entitled to vote. Very few people sitting here had over 50 per cent. of their constituents voting for them. Therefore we ought to be a little careful, although I agree with the hon. Gentleman that industrial relations are different.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0974">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 879</span>
4.45 p.m.<br><br>
Do Government Members know of any sort of election where 80 per cent. of the people actually vote?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They do in Rhodesia.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is remarkable. I have heard of countries where 99.9 per cent. of the people vote, and I sometimes wonder, but in all the elections that I know it is very rare that 80 per cent. of those entitled to vote actually vote.<br><br>
If, of every 100 workers, 21 did not bother to vote, and if the result was 100 per cent. in favour, it would still not meet the requirements of this legislation. Therefore, will the Secretary of State explain where this figure of 80 per cent. comes from?<br><br>
My second question is this. Some employers want a union membership agreement. They find it convenient and good for industrial relations, it helps them to negotiate, and they would like it. As I understand it, if such a union membership agreement were concluded voluntarily between the partners without such a ballot, it would not be illegal. I believe that that is the case, and I stand corrected if I am wrong.<br><br>
If it would not be illegal, who would be protected by the 80 per cent. requirement? First, conscientious objectors would already be protected, so they would not need the extra protection of the 80 per cent. provision. Someone already employed before the union membership agreement was introduced is already protected, so he would not need this 80 per cent. provision, either. Therefore, as far as I can see, the only people who would gain any protection would be those who joined after the introduction of the union membership agreement.<br><br>
These people would know that taking that job entailed joining a union: it would be a condition of membership. In the nature of things, if they had a deeply-held objection, they would not be working there long before they appealed. The amount of compensation which they would get would be nugatory. Therefore, they would have little gain, and I wonder who would be protected by the 80 per cent. provision if employers and unions voluntarily agreed to have a closed shop.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a matter of interest, I ought to draw attention to one
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 880</span>
fault in the drafting of the clause. The phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"and not less than 80 per cent. of those entitled to vote"</p></blockquote>
should of course read "not fewer than 80 per cent", since we are talking here about numbers and not about weights or volumes. I shall let it go, but I like Bills to be written in English, and it is unfortunate when that kind of mistake is allowed to creep in.<br><br>
I am seriously convinced that the clause is intended to prevent union membership agreements coming into operation. If the Government had been a little more honest, they would have written that into the Bill instead of all this nonsense about 80 per cent. They know as well as anyone, as my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) has just pointed out, that a total poll of 80 per cent. is very rarely recorded, whichever way people are voting. It happens regularly in the Soviet Union and now, apparently, it also happens in Zimbabwe. But it is rare in any kind of ballot in this country for that percentage poll to be obtained, and the Government know that to obtain 80 per cent. for one side is just about impossible. It would have been more candid to have made union membership agreements illegal. That is clearly the Government's real intention.<br><br>
The Minister spoke at considerable length about the percentages of union membership in various companies. He told us about companies that will enter agreements if 90 per cent. of their employers are in a union, some if 80 per cent. are members, and so on. That is irrelevant to voting in a ballot. I do not know why the Minister spent so much time on that point. He told us that what he really wanted was an overwhelming majority. He has not explained why two-thirds is not an overwhelming majority.<br><br>
Let us suppose that 422 seats in the House were won in an election by the Conservative Party—Heaven forbid. Would not the Minister regard that as an overwhelming majority? I should seriously like an answer. It would certainly be the biggest majority seen in the House for very many years. I think that the whole country would consider it to be overwhelming.<br><br>
If and when the legislation is enacted—I presume that the Government will force it through—let us say that 79 per cent. of those within a class of employee vote
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0975">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 881</span>
in favour of an agreement and the other 21 per cent. abstain—not a single vote against. Under the terms of the clause, it will not be enough for a union membership agreement to be brought into effect. Yet could the Government pretend that that was not an overwhelming majority—79–0? It is grossly unreasonable to demand a percentage of the electorate as a condition of agreement.<br><br>
There was a great deal of opposition to the inclusion of that sort of provision in the devolution referendums, but at least it was fixed at a percentage that could possibly have been attained. This percentage can never be obtained in normal circumstances. It is disgraceful that the Government should use such subterfuge to prevent agreements being reached. Will the Minister tell us how often an 80 per cent. majority is achieved in the Cabinet?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should probably pause to allow the Secretary of State to reply to that question, but as he seems unwilling to do so, I shall comment on the amendments.<br><br>
The Secretary of State suggested that in most cases the closed shop agreements entered into voluntarily had already received about 80 per cent. of votes. He quoted a number of firms to which an approach had been made to negotiate closed shop agreements and in which more than 80 per cent. of the work force were members of the union. From my experience as a trade union official, having negotiated many closed shop agreements, I would not approach an employer unless I had 75 per cent. or 80 per cent. membership. Otherwise it would decrease our chance of negotiating with an employer for a closed shop. It would be useless to go along and say that we had 51 per cent. of a work force in membership. In equity, that would obviously be a majority, and if there were a majority there should be a closed shop. But in reality that does not happen. Unions have to negotiate with employers for a UMA. As a consequence, no trade union official would go to an employer unless his union had a substantial membership in that establishment.<br><br>
Apparently, the Secretary of State agrees with me. If that is so, why the need to introduce legislation on it? If the practice is established, why is it necessary to bring in such clauses if closed shop
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 882</span>
agreements are usually negotiated when a substantial number of the work force are union members.<br><br>
We must consider what may happen if the legislation is enacted. There will be all sorts of difficulties, one of which was highlighted by my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther). What happens when there is a 79 per cent. majority in favour of a closed shop and 21 per cent. abstain? Would the Bill enable the union, which then recruited another half a dozen members to demand another ballot? In the final analysis there would have to be negotiations between union and management on who would be eligible to vote, and so on. There could be all sorts of problems. The ballot may be held at a time when many members of the workforce were on holiday. In most large establishments the holiday period now runs from May to the end of September or October. As a consequence a number of people may be disfranchised.<br><br>
I do not know the statistics for employees who are sick at any given time. I imagine that 3 per cent. or 5 per cent. of the work force may be away sick, or for other legitimate reasons, on any day. But there is another group that parliamentarians all know. They are the people who are indifferent to whoever is elected to Parliament. They say that all candidates are the same and that they do not intend to vote. About 25 per cent. of the electorate does not bother to vote.<br><br>
That could also apply in a factory. Employees may say that they have no hard and fast feelings about a closed shop. They may think that on balance it is best not to vote. Such employees would amount to a fairly large proportion, if the national pattern were followed. They would be indifferent, but not hostile to the trade union movement, and would be prepared to join the union if a closed shop agreement were negotiated.<br><br>
Who is to define the "constituency"? In the last analysis it may have to be decided by the courts, particularly if the unions fail to agree with the employers on the type of electoral system to be introduced. It will have to be decided whether the ballot should take place at workshop level, whether it should be a postal ballot sent to workers' homes. In the last case there would be no guarantee that the ballot papers reached the workers, or that someone else had not filled them in by mistake. All those difficulties would have to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0976">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 883</span>
be overcome in organising an unnecessary ballot.<br><br>
5 p.m.<br><br>
It seems to me outrageous that in such circumstances, when no ballot is necessary, the Government insist that the majority should be 80 per cent. We all know that a majority is recognised in most of our voting systems and throughout the trade union movement, as more than a half. A view is sustained if 5I per cent. vote for it and 49 per cent. vote against. Yet the Government are asking for an outrageous 80 per cent. of the whole electorate—not just of those who vote. That seems to me to be democracy gone mad.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) mentioned the situation in Zimbabwe, where there has been a substantial vote in favour of the Patriotic Front. The press comment that I like best today was made by a white settler who said: "This is the end of democracy as we know it". That is the type of democracy that is being introduced into our legislation. It is not in evidence without the support of 80 per cent. of the votes. I am surprised that it was not suggested in the Lancaster House discussions that the parties representing the black people in Zimbabwe should be set that target before it could be established that the people of Zimbabwe wanted to rule themselves.<br><br>
For all those reasons, we must tread carefully in this matter. These provisions have been designed specifically to hamper the trade union movement in its work of establishing a closed shop. There is no valid argument in favour of the proposed system, particularly as the Secretary of State has said that voluntary agreements are made on this basis. Mutual agreement is reached between employers and employees on the conditions that should be established for the closed shop.<br><br>
These obstacles are one more method by which the Government can cripple the activities of the trade union movement. They are designed only to put the unions into an impossible position. Although we are constantly told that the provisions will not lead to litigation, there is no doubt—indeed, it is written into the proposals, that if the parties fail to agree that will be a matter for the courts. The only people who will benefit from that are the lawyers. There will be rich pickings for them in litigation arising from the Bill.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 884</span>
We have had an assurance from the Secretary of State that the trade unions already approach employers when they have about 80 per cent. membership, and that voluntary agreements are reached on that basis. I hope, therefore, that there will be no need to bring the majesty of the law into this matter. I hope that, on logical consideration of what we say this afternoon, the Minister will agree to withdraw these provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher) has rightly pointed out that any trade union official approaching any employer about a UMA has strong cards in his hand. He can show that he has a considerable membership in the plant before he asks for a closed shop agreement. The Secretary of State acknowledged that when he accepted that certain elements of the negotiation should be left to the sensible arrangements which apply between employers and trade unions.<br><br>
That was announced in answer to the difficult points that were posed to the Secretary of State by my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker), who outlined some of the many difficulties that may arise among large groups of workers. The weakness in the subsection as drafted is that the Secretary of State and the Tory Party are, as usual, thinking of a monolithic block of workers who will all belong to the same union, or where only one union is involved in a plant. The truth is that invariably a number of unions are involved, catering for different classes of workers. It is in that context that difficulties will probably occur.<br><br>
If our two amendments—they cannot be taken separately—were accepted, we should then be providing that not less than two-thirds of those voting in the ballot must vote in favour. I do not know where the Secretary of State gets his figure of 80 per cent. There is little logic in it except that it is the biggest figure he could think of, unless he goes along with his hon. Friend the Member of Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst), who wants 110 per cent. in favour of a closed shop before it is accepted. But most organisations that have written constitutions require a two-thirds majority for changing their rules.<br><br>
I do not know about the Conservative Party. I am aware that its annual conference is a well-known sham and that, as the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0977">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 885</span>
Needham) indicated this morning, it has few principles. If it has no constitution, if its annual conference is a sham and if it has little in the way of principles, it is clear that it will have no rules about the percentage of votes required to change its constitution or standing orders.<br><br>
But, in the Labour Party—which is often maligned for its weakness and problems—we have strict rules for changing our constitution, as you, Mr. Leadbitter, are aware. There we call for a two-thirds majority, on a secret ballot, of those voting. Our amendment, therefore, is in line with our own party constitution and policy. Organisations with written constitutions require a two-thirds majority in favour of change—a proportion of two to one. If that substantial majority must be obtained to secure approval for changing the rules, I suspect that four to one—the figure that the Secretary of State proposes—means that he is determined not to allow any further closed shop agreements to be made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The position is even worse. It is not four to one of those voting. It is four to one of those eligible to vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for pointing out the slight error that crept into my presentation. He is correct.<br><br>
As my hon. Friends have said, many factors could arise. People might be off sick or out doing a job somewhere else on that day. That would create only bitterness—that is the point of the exercise—after the vote was declared. I do not wish to go over the ground again of 79 per cent. and 21 per cent., or the 79 per cent. with 15 per cent. voting "No" and 6 per cent, abstaining, and what would happen in those circumstances. I am sure that even the Conservatives will recognise the nest of worms that they may turn up there.<br><br>
All this exposes the Secretary of State's appearance as the moderate in the Cabinet as a complete sham. He travels the country making soft speeches and attempting to prove how moderate he is. However, his legislation is not. I come back again and again to the words that he used in our fourth sitting on 5 February:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 886</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"I believe, and have always believed, that if we can get agreement between the parties to sensible changes in the law, that will be the greatest step forward that this country could ever take in industrial relations."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 5 February 1980; c. 177.]</p></blockquote>
[<i>Hon. Members:</i> "Hear, hear".] Of course hon. Members say "Hear, hear", but we shall not get sensible agreement between the parties because, no matter how moderate or modest our amendments are, the Secretary of State rejects them. It is not that the Opposition are arguing that there should not be ballots for union membership agreements, or suggesting that the trade union movement should be allowed to walk into any employer's plant and say "You must have a union membership agreement from tomorrow morning". We agree with the need for secret ballots, for the trade union movement to win the argument for men's minds and hearts. But the Secretary of State accepts none of our arguments. He rejects them, one after another.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not being fair to my right hon. Friend. My right hon. Friend has moved at least half way towards the hon. Gentleman's point of view, if he takes mine as a starting point. I can think of nothing fairer than that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was very much afraid for the Secretary of State. I was expecting a spear to whistle down the corridor and lodge itself between his eyes—a verbal spear, of course. However, it did not.<br><br>
The difference between myself and the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) is that his position is that of a tiny minority, whereas my position is shared by millions of people. I do not think that it is fair to suggest that the compromise between him, who holds a minority position, and someone such as myself who stands in the middle ground can be described as fair.<br><br>
The Secretary of State goes round the country talking about moderation, about going softly, softly, and about winning the hearts and minds of men. But in the amendment, of course, he does nothing of the kind. He seeks to impose shackles on the trade union movement and, I suspect, unwittingly leaves grave danger of industrial strife which may arise from the operation of these subsections.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0978">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 887</span>
Will the Secretary of State consider what will be the position if an employer wants to have a union membership agreement with his workers? The hon. Member for Hendon, North and the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith), who, once again, is not gracing the Committee with his presence, have said repeatedly that it is a cosy arrangement for the employer to have a closed shop agreement so that he deals only with a fairly well-disciplined force rather than with large groups of individuals. That is an argument which, I am sure, the Secretary of State has heard before.<br><br>
What is the position if an employer wishes to conclude a union membership agreement with his work force, and holds the ballot in accordance with the provisions of the Bill—which, presumably, will have become an Act because of the present silent majority of the Tory Party—and 75 per cent. of the work force agree? The other 25 per cent. may be accounted for by sickness, abstention or any other cause. If only 75 per cent. have agreed, in the terms of the proposed legislation, the agreement will not be accepted. If the employer is satisfied with 75 per cent. and accepts a post-entry union membership agreement, what will happen? There will always be one or two individuals at any plant who will take a strong stand on anything under the sun. Will they be entitled to go to court, to have that agreement ruled illegal?<br><br>
The Secretary of State must answer these questions. It is all very well uttering pious platitudes in a House of Commons Committee, and saying that reasonable men will not see the issue in that fashion. I am sure that his hon. and learned Friend the Under Secretary can explain to him, if he does not already understand, that the trouble with litigation is that invariably it is not reasonable men who go to the courts: it is unreasonable men, or men who want to carry on an argument to God knows what lengths.<br><br>
That is the difficulty. In my view, we shall not only face considerable industrial relations problems: we shall also be involved in much litigation. I suspect that that is not what the Secretary of State wants. I suspect that he would like the trade union movement quietly to fold its tents and steal away. Yet, if he is honest with himself and with his Cabinet colleagues, he will make it clear to them that there is not much chance of that. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 888</span>
trade union movement will fight on these issues, and problems will flow from the proposed legislation.<br><br>
I would also remind the Secretary of State that in a separate amendment this morning I pointed out the difficulties that could arise if non-trade unionists worked in a plant and the trade union in the plant or shop laid down that agreements on wages or conditions would apply only to the union members. Bearing in mind our arguments this morning, and the clause before us, that would be a natural way for the trade union to move.<br><br>
Far from improving industrial relations, the Bill is a recipe for disaster, and I suspect that the Secretary of State will regret the day that it was ever placed on the statute book. If he wishes to maintain his reputation for moderation and his ability to get on with the trade union movement, it is time he started listening to the Opposition's sensible amendments. That would prove that the agreement between the parties about which he talks would come to pass. First he must start listening to us; he has not listened up to now.</span></p>
<p>5.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: regret having to inflict yet another speech on the Committee, but I am glad to respond to what the right hon. Gentleman has said in response to some of my points. He has responded to—I choose those words carefully, rather than "answered"—some of my points, but he failed conspicuously to address himself to the specific terms of the amendments. The important point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) had also occurred to me, but he has given it added force. The Secretary of State owes it to us to spell out the extent to which this subsection will be mandatory. Will it be possible to obtain a new union membership agreement only if a ballot has taken place? In the absence of a ballot, will any union membership agreement be invalidated?<br><br>
I am glad that the hon. and learned Gentleman is indicating "No", and I hope that that will be spelt out. Perhaps the Government will consider tabling their own amendments to make it clear without any doubt that if an employer and a union agree between themselves that there will be no necessity for a ballot to take place, they are free to enter into a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0979">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 889</span>
union membership agreement without a ballot.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They can make any agreement they like, and they can abide by it between themselves. However, the theme of this part of the Bill is that if the employer subsequently wishes to sack an employee for not belonging to a union specified in the closed shop agreement, he cannot avail himself of the protection now given by section 58 of the 1978 Act, and be relieved of the necessity to pay compensation for unfair dismissal. That would be the effect of failure to hold a ballot. It would simply deprive the employer of "immunity" from being liable to pay compensation for unfair dismissal. It does not mean that the closed shop agreement is invalid, unlawful or any other adjective.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: "Unenforceable" is the adjective.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I think it is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. and learned Gentleman is saying is that if, in the event of an employer entering into such an agreement, an employee objects to being required to be a member of a union which is party to the UMA on grounds other than those of conscience, deeply-held personal conviction, or religion, and if the employer consequently dismisses him, the employer will be liable to pay compensation.<br><br>
The Committee will no doubt reflect on that. It seems that it has the effect of making this part of the Bill mandatory. It confirms my understanding that a union membership agreement shall be taken for the purposes of section 58(3C) to have been approved if a ballot has been held on the question. That only confirms the fact touched upon by my hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) that they really are mandatory, or the employer must be prepared to face the consequences and pay compensation.<br><br>
I again make the point that, while the Government seem to continue to assume that such cases are isolated, they could involve large groups of employees whom the employer has not the financial resources to compensate and whose services he does not wish to lose because they are an essential part of his undertaking.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 890</span>
I now turn to what the right hon. Gentleman said. When I read the document from which I quoted earlier, I thought that there had been a misunderstanding. <i>The Industrial Relations Legal Information Bulletin</i> states that it would seem open to the parties to union membership agreements under the new legislation themselves to define the class covered by the agreement—I am paraphrasing—and hence the employees eligible to vote on the agreement so as to exclude those who would have the statutory right to stay out of the union anyway.<br><br>
But the right hon. Gentleman has confirmed that that is the case. Apparently the trade union concerned can group those on whose behalf it is submitting its application to the employer so as to ensure, in advance, the outcome of the ballot. I am not sure that that would necessarily suit the purposes of the union in that situation, but it certainly does not rule out, and seems to invite, the possibility of some kind of carve-up.<br><br>
While the Bill refers to the class of employees and the right hon. Gentleman has referred to the, apparently intended, vagueness of the application of the word "class", I am sure that it has acquired over the years a legal definition and significance, not least because the words "class" and "grade" used to have a special significance in industrial relations in that, in accordance with national insurance legislation, anyone engaged in an industrial dispute was likely to be denied unemployment benefit if he failed to pass certain tests, one of which was that he should not belong to the class or grade of those engaged in the dispute. In that context, the word doubtless acquired a legal definition which may linger. However, notwithstanding what the right hon. Gentleman said about it being unlikely that these matters would end up in the courts, we cannot rule out that possibility.<br><br>
The Under Secretary will correct me if I am wrong—we are talking here of legal matters—but, as I understand it, the "grade" of a person means that he is skilled, semi-skilled or unskilled, and the "class" would apply to the occupational class of, for example, a fitter, a spinner or a weaver. That understanding about the legal meaning of "class" may be invoked in the event, which I think is still possible, that this part of the Bill forms the subject of proceedings in a court. We cannot rule out that possibility.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0980">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 891</span>
I shall put the issue the other way around. We have been thinking primarily of a large group of people who may want to embrace, within a union membership agreement, a smaller dissident group which would prefer to remain outside, but let us suppose that it is the small group that wishes to establish a closed shop to the disadvantage, perhaps, of a large group.<br><br>
For example, the groups to which we referred earlier—the winding men in the coal industry in Yorkshire, or the signalmen on the railways or the toolmakers in the engineering industry—may feel that they have a special interest separating them from other workers with whom they are identified. They may want to establish a closed shop which would deny others in that industry the right to move into that employment—move sideways, be promoted or whatever. In that event, the larger group may challenge their pursuit of that closed shop, even though the employer may agree to their participating in a UMA.<br><br>
I hope that the right hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that they should make their challenge in the form of industrial action, if the employer is not persuaded. I am sure that they would seek to establish their point in whatever judicial forum is open to them.<br><br>
In the interest of brevity I tried this morning to keep my quotation from this useful document to the minimum necessary for my argument. <i>The Legal Information Bulletin</i> is not issued by Transport House; it is not a result of TUC or Labour research. It is a respectable commercial organisation offering objective well-founded advice to employers. The Secretary of State is muttering; if he has disparaging comments to make he should stand and make them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I have not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know nothing about this organisation other than that which I read in the bulletins that it kindly sends me, but it does not share the right hon. Gentleman's judgment. The right hon. Gentleman may say that, as Minister in charge of the Bill, he should know his job, but as Ministers—I speak from experience—we can all believe that our legislation will have an effect and then too often learn the hard way that we have not taken into account the Lord Dennings of the world in the courts
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 892</span>
who interpret the cold print differently and pay little or no heed to what Ministers have said in Standing Committees.<br><br>
The bulletin goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Bill provides that the ballot shall be conducted so as to secure ' so far as reasonably practicable ' that all those entitled to vote have an opportunity of voting and that the ballot is held in secret. There are bound to be questions of interpretation arising as to who is eligible to vote in a ballot and how the ballot is conducted. Although it is possible that Industrial Tribunals could adjudicate on such questions if they are raised in the context of an unfair dismissal action where the dismissal is on grounds of non-membership, it is more likely that aggrieved parties will take proceedings in the High Court to have the results of a ballot set aside."</p></blockquote>
That only confirms what we have been arguing, and the right hon. Gentleman sweeps it aside as though it were of no consequence.<br><br>
How does the right hon. Gentleman intend to ensure that these matters do not become the subject of litigation, that they remain the subject of voluntary agreement, as he hopes?<br><br>
Finally, I hope that he will address himself to the important points that have been advanced in support of our amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall do my best to answer the questions that have been put to me. This has been a useful debate and it has raised a number of important issues.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) asked why we had chosen a figure of 80 per cent. and whether this would mean that there would be very few closed shops. We have deliberately chosen a high figure of 80 per cent. to ensure that a new closed shop will be approved only where it is genuinely and positively wanted by a large majority of those who will be affected.<br><br>
It will be argued that this measure is designed to halt the spread of closed shops. It is certainly designed to halt the spread of closed shops where they are not positively desired. However, it is true to say—this was borne out by the hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher)—that, in general, closed shops are not established unless there is already a high percentage of union membership amongst relevant employees. The 80 per cent. ballot recognises that.<br><br>
If there was need for further evidence of the fact that 80 per cent. ballots are possible, I would refer the hon. Member
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0981">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 893</span>
for Rotherham to the recent ballots in ACAS recognition inquiries. The ballots here are often complicated and not supported by employers, and out of 140 ACAS reports showing evidence of ballots 90 or two-thirds have achieved a response rate of more than 80 per cent.<br><br>
5.30 p.m.<br><br>
I agree that we are making it difficult for new closed shops because Government Members believe that if there is to be a closed shop it must be a positive act in which everyone has had a chance to take part and decide.<br><br>
We have felt over the last few years that a number of people have been dragooned into closed shops against their will. That would probably never have arisen if it had not been for the British Rail cases.<br><br>
I am not saying that I am grateful for the scorn expressed by the hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans), although a little scorn from him is not always unhelpful. But we believe that there should be a very high percentage indeed before a major step is undertaken.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton)—who is not here at the moment—asked why we should choose 80 per cent.—why not have 51 per cent.? We had much talk about Zimbabwe and other places. The point is that, in any case, we know that the union would go for a higher union membership before it asked for a closed shop. But nothing could be worse for industrial relations on the shop floor than to go for a union membership agreement that would dragoon people into the union on a 51 per cent. majority. That is why it does not happen. That is why no responsible union leader will go for one—or should go for one—with 51 per cent. any more than it would be accepted by a personnel manager that 51 per cent. was sufficient. The membership needs to be getting on for 90 per cent. before we get to that stage. Therefore, viewed in that context the 80 per cent. figure is not too bad.<br><br>
But it is also important that there are many people who are willingly members of the union but do not particularly like the closed shop. I suspect that some of those who are members of the union will still vote against the closed shop, for one reason or another.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 894</span>
Gentleman appreciate that if a union had less than 80 per cent.—perhaps 60 or 70 per cent.—many employees might be afraid that if they joined a trade union they might get the sack. The consequence is that they are reluctant to join a union. However, if employers were prepared to recognise less than 80 per cent.—60 or 51 per cent. for example—a union is then recognised and people flock into it.<br><br>
That is my experience where we have induced employers who do not have a high membership to enter into closed shop agreements. Those members recognise that they can join a union without being victimised. The right hon. Gentleman should understand that that is a great fear of many people. They say that their employer does not like unions and that if they associate with them they will be out on the streets. They say that as a consequence they must be very careful what they do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the hon. Gentleman is that where it is a case of recognition, it is generally accepted at a much lower figure than 80 per cent. I am not certain, off hand, of the general figure for ACAS but I believe that it was between 30 and 40 per cent. that gave recognition.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman is saying that after that a lot of workers, who up to that time have been frightened to join a union because of their employers wishes, flock into the union. I still do not think that that in any way mitigates the need for it to be tested by a ballot. I would have thought that a ballot on cases of this sort is an introduction of something which would be supported wholeheartedly by the work force. Not only that, but it is a good demonstration of democracy at work. Therefore, we all ought to be in favour of a ballot, and for the reasons I have given, of a high percentage.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) and the hon. Member for Newton asked whether an employer who wanted a union membership agreement could have one if he held a ballot and 75 per cent. of the work force agreed. My hon. and learned Friend dealt with that but I shall deal with it again. The answer is that he can have a union membership agreement but that he will have no defence against a claim for unfair dismissal if he subsequently dismisses individuals for non-membership of a union.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0982">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 895</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Secretary of State further? If the employer enters such an agreement with the trade unions, a post-entry closed shop will be operating. Thus, any new employee seeking work at that establishment will be told that he will have to become a member of the trade union. Will the earlier provisions of the Bill apply if the applicant refuses to join the trade union?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, we must deal with practical realities. If a new employee were told that a closed shop operated that had been entered into in a legal way—a union membership agreement according to the procedure laid down in the Bill—he would be given a month or so to make up his mind. If, at the end of that period, he told his employer that he was not prepared to join the union, the employer would, in the circumstances, say "I am afraid that your period of probation has ended and we are not prepared to employ you". That would be the normal state of affairs and there seems to be no reason why that should not persist. But much would depend on the union membership agreement having been properly entered into in the first place. That is the important point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important that we clear that point. If 75 per cent. rather than 80 per cent. of the work force voted in a ballot, in accordance with the provisions, in favour of a closed shop, and the management accepted the 75 per cent. vote and established a closed shop, what would happen if a new employee lost his job because he did not wish to join the union? What about the other 20 per cent. who could point out to the employer that he was in breach of an Act of Parliament that called for an 80 per cent. turn-out? Would that not lead on to the litigation that many of us talked about earlier?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the person were a new entrant, if there had been no ballot and if the new employee decided not to join the union, it would be an unfair dismissal if he were dismissed for non-membership of the union. I will follow up that point because the hon. Member for Newham, North-East, asked a similar question. He said that the only people who would benefit from the ballot requirement would be new employees. That is not right. First, it is important that everyone should
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 896</span>
have the security of knowing that UMAs cannot be entered into without their being consulted and, secondly, an existing employee who remains in the union will subsequently retain his right to withdraw and be protected if there has been no valid ballot. That is the same position as for the new employee who entered a firm where there had not been a ballot before the union membership agreement was brought in.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I pursue the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Evans)? As I understand the position—this has been mentioned and confirmed during the debate—if the employer wants to enter into a union agreement without holding any ballot, he is at liberty to do so. But the consequences will be those that were fairly spelt out by the Minister. Thus, if an employer dismisses an employee, he is liable to pay compensation.<br><br>
But the Minister has so far talked in terms of the dismissal of the employee. In the hypothetical situation where, as my hon. Friend the Member for Newton puts it, there has been a 75 per cent. "for" in the ballot, or no ballot at all, but, nonetheless, the employer has agreed that there should be a UMA, what happens when a new applicant is turned away because he refuses to accept an obligation to join the union?<br><br>
Secondly, will the right hon. Gentleman confirm that, notwithstanding an 80 per cent—plus "for" in the ballot, existing employees who have voted "no" and who refuse to join the union will still be protected from unfair dismissal? Although the overwhelming majority of employees have voted for a closed shop, will they, under the other provisions in the Bill, be protected against any obligation to join the union mentioned in the UMA? In other words, despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of employees have voted "for", that they have passed Becher's Brook and the water jump put together, the union is still denied the reality of the closed shop because those who did not want to join will still be protected from an obligation to join.<br><br>
I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will deal with those two points—the denial of the UMA, despite more than 80 per cent. voting for it and, secondly, the position arising when a new applicant
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0983">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 897</span>
for employment is turned away because he is not prepared to join the union.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer the right hon. Gentleman's second point first. Where a ballot shows an 80 per cent. plus vote in favour of a union membership agreement, the right hon. Gentleman asked what would happen to the I0, I5 or 20 per cent. of workers who voted against the UMA and who are not members of the union. They do not have to join the union. They are protected as non-union members by being members of the existing work force. We have always made it perfectly clear that in any union membership agreement we will not force members of the existing work force into the union when a closed shop is introduced.<br><br>
That is one of the reasons I spoke so strongly about this, on an earlier amendment to this clause, in the case of the three British Rail people in front of the European Commission. We believe that had those three men had the rights proposed in the Bill the case would never have been brought. They were members of the existing work force and as such could not be forced into the union against their will. I make that point absolutely clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend address himself to the reverse of this problem? If a closed shop is legitimately established on the basis of an 80 per cent. vote and at some stage the employer—perhaps a small employer with a small work force—is asked by 80 per cent. of those who belong to a trade union that the closed shop be disbanded, what would be the position of the 20 per cent. that remain in union membership if the employer had to dismiss them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I ought to say that I need notice of that question. If 80 per cent. left the union there 'would no longer 'be a union membership agreement, but 20 per cent. would remain members of the union. If there is no union membership agreement and the union members are dismissed for any reason by the employer they 'come under the ordinary unfair dismissal procedures legislation. If they are unfairly dismissed they will be entitled to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 898</span>
position that exists in the greater part of industry where there is no closed shop.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, will my right hon. Friend say whether he believes it would be desirable to have regular testing of the situation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had a feeling that my hon. Friend might be coming to that point. This is very much a matter for a code of practice. I do not believe that it should be written into law. Unnecessary problems could arise in industrial relations on the shop floor On the other hand, periodic review of a closed shop is not a bad thing. If it confirms that that is what the work force want, it would be right in a code of practice to give guidance.<br><br>
I believe I am right in saying that the American experience is that a period review after every three years is a requirement. It seems to work well there, but I am an old enough hand at this game not necessarily to believe that what works well enough in America will work well here.<br><br>
May I now, if I can still remember it, answer the second point raised by the right hon. Gentleman? He asked what happens when an applicant applies for a job and after he has obtained the job—</span></p>
<p>5.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He is denied a job because he will not make a declaration that he is willing to join the union.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If there has been no valid ballot the applicant has no rights.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me spell it out again. The employer and the union have either agreed to dispense with the ballot or the employer has 'been persuaded that, notwithstanding what the Bill calls for, there are sufficient votes in favour for him to establish a UMA with the unions. Therefore, a UMA exists which has not been validated by an 80 per cent. test. A person applies for a job and the employer lays down a condition of employment that he must belong to the union but the applicant refuses to join the union so the employer informs him that he cannot have the job. What happens then?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0984">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 899</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In those circumstances I do not think the applicant has any rights. It is entirely a matter for the employer to tell the applicant what he has to do when he is taken on.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 900</span>
<p>possible that a court, looking at a case arising under clause 6, in which, as described by my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster a person has applied for a job and been refused because he will not join a trade union, could see a parallel between that and what is set out in clause 3, where someone seeking employment has certain rights concerning expulsion or exclusion from a trade union and is entitled to compensation?</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Under clause 3 we are giving a specific right of damages against a union when someone who is excluded or expelled can cite his loss of job to an industrial tribunal or the employment appeal tribunal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or failure to get a job.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that I know what the hon. Gentleman is getting at. We are not actually dealing with those who are refused a job because an employer says, "I am not going to take you on as you are a member of a union". That is totally different, because they have the opportunity of finding other jobs. But if a man loses his union card and therefore his job, he often loses his livelihood too, which is why we have taken that view.<br><br>
An applicant for employment has no right to get the job irrespective of whether there has been a ballot. An employer does not need to have a good reason for not taking someone on. Clause 3 does not give a right against an employer, but only against a trade union.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 9, Noes 13.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0985">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 901</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 95, in page 8, line 29, after "conducted", insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"if they so wish, by the trade union or unions specified in the agreement (at such time or times it or they determine at or near the place of work of the persons entitled to vote)".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 96, in page 8, line 31, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(4) Where a ballot is held under subsection (3) above, the employer shall provide to the specified union or unions such facilities as are reasonable for the trade union or unions to communicate with the workers entitled to vote in order to acquaint them with the nature of the decision to be taken, and shall consult with such trade union or unions concerning any communications which he intends to make to such workers relating to the decision of the ballot.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments have been tabled to draw attention to the fact that there is nothing whatever in the subsection to identify who will have the responsibility for financing and making the administrative arrangements for the ballot, no requirement concerning the machinery and nothing to suggest who will conduct it—employers, workers' representatives or unions. We have already made abundantly clear in earlier debates our distaste for the whole process. Our view is that if such ballots are to be held, the appropriate organisation for conducting them should be the union, if it wishes to do that. We do not say that it must be the union, unless it feels, "This is a matter affecting our chaps, so we really should do it. What is at issue is the interests of our membership, so we ought to conduct the ballot".<br><br>
That is not to say that the employer can then wash his hands of the matter and state, "You chaps go ahead. You have to conduct a ballot because the law requires that one is held, so you must find the resources for it, and so on". As in such circumstances unions would feel that their request should not be subject to such a test anyway, we believe that they should not have to incur the cost and provide the facilities. First, that should be up to the employer. Secondly, by and large only the employer can provide the facilities.<br><br>
I am not sure whether it was the Government's intention for the employer to carry out this process, or
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 902</span>
whether they have even thought about who should do it. But if the employer is required to carry out the ballot, that will further sour the co-operation and goodwill of the unions that has already been prejudiced by the statutory obligation that has been thrust on them.<br><br>
I turn to the question of consultation and communication. We must think back to the position that existed in industry. From my experience, notwithstanding the fact that when I worked in a closed shop, if I wished to communicate with the full-time district official of my union I had to seek the permission of my employer to leave the premises, with loss of pay, even to gain access to a telephone. If we are now to have ballots, even though the Government intend that employers should carry them out, and if I were a trade union lay official in such a position, there would be an obvious responsibility on me to inform my members and to discuss our views with them. Perhaps I should have to issue leaflets, and so on. Unless facilities and resources are provided, it would be very difficult for me to do that.<br><br>
I am reluctant to make further comparisons with what has happened in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, but that illustrates the difficulties of conducting elections when there is no tradition of providing machinery and adequate resources. That will be important if the ballots are to be conducted in a way that does not leave subsequent lingering doubt and suspicion, and possibly resentment, about the way in which the ballot has been conducted.<br><br>
If they are to work, I hope that sensible employers and trade unions will spurn the need to overcome such hurdles in reaching agreement, and that in the light of what the Government have said they will deem that advisable and necessary.<br><br>
6 p.m.<br><br>
I hope that if we have to go along this road, the trade unions will be allowed, if they wish, to be involved in the organisation of the ballots and will have facilities to communicate with their members and to do all that is necessary in such circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</span><span class='membercontribution'>:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0986">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 903</span>
The right hon. Gentleman finished by expressing the hope that the unions would be allowed to play their part in making arrangements for the ballots. The answer is that of course they will. There is no obligation in the clause for there to be a ballot at all. As the right hon. Gentleman pointed out, there is nothing in the subsection which specifies who shall carry out the ballot. But when one considers the purpose of the whole provision, it becomes clear that it is the employer who will wish to carry out the ballot, for more than one reason.<br><br>
First, the provision for a ballot is one that the employer will wish to see complied with, because it is for his own protection. It does not seem to me to matter to a union whether a ballot is held or not. It matters very much to the employer. If he makes a closed shop agreement with a trade union, the union will insist thereafter that people who are not members will, in certain circumstances at any rate, be dismissed. If the employer is not to have to pay compensation for unfair dismissal, he will have to be able to show that a ballot complying with the provisions of section 6 of the Act was held in proper circumstances and that 80 per cent. or more employees said "Yes". For that reason alone, therefore, the employer will wish to conduct the ballot himself.<br><br>
Secondly, the right hon. Gentleman says that the unions would consider that as it is a matter affecting their chaps they should carry out the ballot. But while it will certainly affect their chaps, it will not only affect their chaps, because the clause requires that the ballot should be held for all members of the work force who will be affected by it. whether they are union members or not. The employer is more likely to be better able to reach the non-union members and to have particulars of them, their addresses and so on, than is the union.<br><br>
That is, therefore, the likely outcome. But I do not believe that there is a need for any of this to be spelt out in the clause. The less the clause says, the better, provided that adequate guidance is given. It is necessary that a ballot should be held. If a union wishes to hold a ballot, and if that is agreed with the employer, well and good. Let it so be. In these discussions, we tend to lose sight of the fact that a closed shop agreement is an agreement. It therefore
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 904</span>
cannot exist without agreement between the parties. They will not just agree to have a closed shop arrangement. They will also, presumably, agree on the means by which it should be brought about, and the means by which the ballot necessary for the protection of the employer shall be held.<br><br>
Therefore, I do not feel that there is very much between us on this. I hope that I have assured the right hon. Gentleman that there is absolutely no reason why a trade union that is dead set on holding a ballot should not be able to persuade the employer to do so. But the employer will wish to monitor it fairly carefully, because if at a later stage it should turn out that the ballot was invalid, it is the employer, and not the union, who will carry the can for any subsequent dismissals.<br><br>
I do not think that I need say more. I hope that I shall not be accused of not answering the points. I think that I have answered them. I do not wish to take up the time of the Committee unnecessarily. I believe that I have said all that T usefully can. There is really no need for the amendments. Therefore, while I appreciate the right hon. Gentleman's reasons for tabling them, in order to prevent the Bill being cluttered with unnecessary and possibly misleading verbiage, I must advise my hon. Friends not to support the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman a couple of questions of fact? I think that we have dealt with the question of the relevance of clause I to this. However, in case we have not, may I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman whether the funds to be made available for trade unions for the conduct of ballots under clause I will be available for these ballots? Secondly, do the Government have in mind that these ballots shall be postal ballots?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was asked that question in the Committee on 29 January and my reply appears at columns 96–97 of the <i>Official Report.</i> The essence of the matter is that in this context it is a ballot of all those affected, not just union members. Clause I, of course, relates to ballots to be held by unions for union matters, and hence restricted to a constituency of union members. It is, there-

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 905</span>
fore, unlikely that the clause I provision would be used in these circumstances.<br><br>
I therefore still believed, as a I believed on 29 January, that I am right in saying that, technically, if a union wished to conduct a ballot itself, although it would be a ballot only of its own members, it could bring itself within this provision. However, the question is academic, and is unlikely to arise in practice, because a ballot under clause 6 would not be a</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman wish formally to move amendment No. 96?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, Mr. Lead-bitter.</span></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eric G. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a good go on the amendments to the clause and I do not wish to detain the Committee much longer, although I suspect that some of my hon. Friends will probably have some views on the clause as it now stands. It is to be very much regretted that the Government have not accepted some of the amendments. While we regard the clause as a recipe for nit-picking and trouble-making, had some amendments been made, the clause would be much more acceptable. As it is, we still think that it will cause more trouble than it is worth.<br><br>
On previous amendments, we have been able to point out that there are deep reservations on the clause, not only in trade union organisations but with employers, too. On a couple of occasions the reservations of the Engineering Employers' Federation have been raised and neither the Under-Secretary nor the Secretary of State on any occasion has taken heed of the advice given from that quarter.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 906</span>
<p>valid and sufficient one to give protection to the employer when he subsequently dismissed somebody for not joining a trade union after a UMA had been concluded unless it had embraced the whole constituency of the work force and not just those who were union members.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 9, Noes 12.</p>
<p>In my post this morning came a further piece of correspondence from the Institute of Personnel Management. I assume that the same representation has been made to other Committee members. I see that the hon. Member for Norfolk, South (Mr. MacGregor) is nodding, so I presume that he has received it. I think it is worth while reading into the record what the Institute says about clause 6 and the conscience clause:</p>
<p>"The proposal is to extend the grounds of exemption to those 'of conscience or other deeply held <i>personal conviction</i> to being a member of any union or of <i>a particular trade union'.</i> We underline part of this extract to draw attention to a potential source of very real and practical dispute and controversy. The Institute submitted that these grounds for conscience or personal conviction should only apply to the general principle of trade union membership but not to membership of a particular union for the following reasons ".</p>
<p>Then it goes on—I shall not read much further—
<br><blockquote><p>"It is not in the interests of more stable industrial relations to allow or facilitate such potentially divisive issues to occur where a closed shop agreement is in force."</p></blockquote></p>
<p>Again, my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) a moment ago quoted a document and said that it did not come from any TUC or Labour Party source. I should have thought that the representation from the Institute of Personnel Management came from an impeccable source. I find it surprising that the Ministers answering for the Government in the Committee
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0988">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 907</span>
have not taken it into account. Extending religious belief into deeply-held personal conviction will, again, cause great difficulties in interpretation.</p>
<p>I come now to the end of the clause and the provision for 80 per cent. of those entitled to vote in a ballot before a union membership agreement can be established. One can only conclude, as a result of what has been said by Ministers, that the Government do not want to see any further union membership agreements concluded at all. With hurdles such as this, we shall not get union membership agreements in conformity with this provision, particularly as the employer is to conduct the ballot. He will consult, presumably, about the questions to be put to the work force before the ballot takes place, but all history shows that where employers get involved in these matters—there is a deep suspicion—people do not participate to the fullest extent.</p>
<p>In reply to one of the amendments the Secretary of State said that he did not want to see anyone dragooned into a closed shop. I should have thought that it would have paid him to have read his own <i>Employment Gazette</i> published in November 1979. A feature written by Mr. John Gennard, Mr. Stephen Dunn and Mr. Michael Wright entitled "The content of British closed shop agreements" is extremely enlightening.</p>
<p>6.15 p.m.</p>
<p>I suspect that the Under-Secretary has read the article; I am not so sure about the Secretary of State—he probably has too much on his plate to read every piece of information that comes under his nose. The summary of the feature says:</p>
<p>"Negotiators have coneluded increasingly sophisticated post-entry UMAs to define precisely the obligations and rights of workers where union membership exists as a condition of employment, and, despite enormous variation in detail, there appears to be a growing standardisation in broad content matter which is only partly attributable to legal considerations. For example, where new closed shops have appeared, it has increasingly become the norm to exclude existing non-unionists from compulsion to join the union."</p>
<p>That is, where union membership agreements have been voluntarily negotiated, right from the start it has been recognised that there may be people with religious convictions, or strong personal convictions that they ought not to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 908</span>
belong, and these are taken into account.</p>
<p>The Secretary of State will probably say that by writing in subsection (6), the employer is fully protected against unfair dismissal. That is the norm, the base line. But I do not think that there have been examples of union membership agreements being concluded voluntarily where people have run into great difficulty; otherwise, of course, they would not have been a success.</p>
<p>The summary goes on:</p>
<p>"Over 63 per cent. of the sample fall into this category. Moreover, procedures specially designed to handle difficulties arising from the operation of the UMA and often incorporating provision for an independent arbitrator have become a regular, if seldom used, feature."</p>
<p>So they have not only taken into account those who do not necessarily want to belong to the trade union; they have built into the provision for some third party to come in and settle the dispute although, as the summary says, it is seldom used. So it is a great pity that the Secretary of State and the Government want to persist with the clause.</p>
<p>There is a point that I raised earlier that was not answered at the time. It supports the argument I am putting forward that it is likely that more disputes will arise as a result of the conditions allowed here. It is highly unlikely that some unions will want to try to fulfil the conditions of subsection (3). We shall have to see—only time will tell. Such conditions are intolerable in some respects. As my hon. Friends have said, very few trade unions will want to go down that road. But assuming that they do and assuming, too, that we shall not have provisions such as the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) tried to persuade the Committee to take on board to deal with the free rider, there may be one or two trade unions who say "Let's chance our arm. Let's see whether we can jump this enormous hurdle. Let's see whether we can get this 80 per cent. of everybody employed in this group." In those circumstances, let us assume, further, that they fall short by 5 per cent. That would mean that 75 per cent, were in favour. The employer would not be able to conclude a membership agreement in accordance with the provisions of the Bill. That is not to say that he could not have a voluntary agreement and take the risk of a claim for unfair dismissal, and so on, but he would probably con-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0989">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 909</span>
clude that he could not go ahead with it. He will then have 75 per cent, of his work force totally disgruntled, feeling that they have been cheated in some way. All the analogies used by my right hon. and hon. Friends about results in general elections, how many support Governments, how many support political parties who form Governments, and what happened in Zimbabwe, will be brought to the fore.</p>
<p>We could find that other sanctions were being taken. First, there could be 75 per cent, disgruntled members of a trade union who wanted to take some industrial action against the 5 per cent. who did not agree to join the union for one reason or another. We shall find that on the whole this clause will be bad for industrial relations, and it is a great pity that some of the amendments were not accepted as they would have made the clause a little more acceptable.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am rather disappointed that the right hon. Gentleman should begin with a castigation of the Government for having accepted no amendments and then go on to say how intolerable this is and that it shows that we are not paying the slightest attention to anything said in Committee, when we began our proceedings on the clause by indicating that we were prepared to accept an amendment. We accepted the amendment to insert the word "genuinely" into the conscience clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Giles Radice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Big deal!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A great deal of importance was attached to it by the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker), and he worked himself up into splendid demonstrations of fervour, which was all entirely sincere and now I am told that the amendment did not amount to a row of beans and there are cries of "Big deal" when I draw attention to the fact that we accepted it. I shall not look so kindly and with such concern upon the right hon. Gentleman's fervour in future.<br><br>
We accepted that amendment as we felt that it was a proper one to accept, but I am afraid that we have not been able to accept other amendments, although we have genuinely listened carefully to the arguments advanced on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 910</span>
them. I think that the reason is that there exists between the Government and the Opposition sides of the Committee a fundamental difference of view about the significance of a closed shop agreement made after somebody has gone on to the payroll and taken up his job. We also believe that there is a fundamental difference between us about the impact that a closed shop agreement has upon anybody's freedom to choose.<br><br>
In the case of an existing member, we are convinced he need give no reasons at all for not joining, and, if he is dismissed subsequent to the UMA, he ought to be paid compensation. We believe that to be essential and, therefore, that that part of the clause certainly ought to stand part of the Bill. We also think that the conscience provisions in the new subsection (3A) are extremely important and that it is important to widen them so that religious ground is not the sole basis upon which someone can bring himself within the conscientious exemption.<br><br>
Thirdly, we think it right that new subsection (3C) proposes that hereafter if an employer does not want to have to pay unfair dismisssal compensation to a worker for non-membership, he must show that a ballot was held and that an 80 per cent.—or better—"Yes" vote was obtained.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman said what an intolerable provision this was, how impossible it was and what a great hurdle it was to overcome. But my right hon. Friend disposed of those points conclusively when he showed the high proportion of the ACAS ballots or surveys of opinion—votes from workers concerned in the recognition issues. It was 90 out of 140, and those were closely parallel inquiries. There is a single constituency of the workers to be involved in a recognition issue, and if one can get better than a 80 per cent. "Yes" vote in inquiries of that type it cannot be said with any credibility that this is an impossible hurdle for a trade union to overcome. It has been observed in the Committee that trade unions seldom ask for a closed shop agreement until they have something like 80 per cent, membership. Therefore we think that the case on the percentage has been greatly exaggerated. We have been twitted for not heeding
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0990">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 911</span>
or taking into account expressions of opinion from such people as the Engineering Employers' Federation and the Institute of Personnel Management, but I assure those organisations and all those who have been kind enough to give us advice that it has been heeded and taken into account, and it must not be assumed that because it has not been agreed with, or acceded to, that it has been ignored, which is a different matter. The right hon. Gentleman mentioned the Department of Employment's survey. As Mr. Gennard's survey in the November issue of the <i>Employment Gazette</i> points out, it is increasingly the norm for closed shop agreements to have voluntary provisions for objectors on conscience grounds and for existing employees.</span></p>
<p>The argument cannot be sustained that because that is the case, there is no need for legislation, because it is not enough to rely upon the good examples. Examples remain of closed shop agreements which do not provide for these people and, because we regard them as having important rights, we think it proper, and essential, to legislate as we do in the clause.</p>
<p>The right hon. Gentleman said, lastly, that it was likely that more disputes would arise here, that these were intolerable provisions for trade unions to overcome, and that if 75 per cent. voted "Yes", there would be a shortfall of 5 per cent. and the whole of the 75 per cent. would be disgruntled. He went on to say that he thought that they would take industrial action against the 5 per cent. I do not know how they would be identified, because the ballot must be secret. The right hon. Gentleman is pushing it rather. That argument would apply to any percentage, and one of the amendments which we have spent a lot of time discussing today would have reduced the 80 per cent. to two-thirds. If there were not 66 per cent. but 60 per cent., the same argument would he applied; there would be great disgruntlement on the part of 60 per cent. One must draw the line somewhere, and the best way to do it is to take a point of principle and say that there ought to be overwhelming support by the workers affected. If that cannot be got, but an employer still makes a closed shop agreement with a union, it can be done, it will not be unlawful, but it will be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 912</span>
the employer's risk if subsequently he sacks somebody.</p>
<p>I think that I unwittingly misled the Committee with my reference to the ACAS surveys a few moments ago. The 90 out of 140 refers not to cases where the "Yes" vote exceeded 80 per cent, but where the response rate exceeded 80 per cent. of those balloted.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Quite different.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. I apologise for having misled the Committee in that way. I am anxious to make that clear. But if one gets that response rate, it does not seem to indicate that there is this high proportion of indifferent people in the constituency that I think the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) referred to. Certainly we have had recent experience in the British Leyland ballot of 85 per cent. of the total electorate voting "Yes," and one remembers—not with great happiness on the Government side of the Committee—the NUR's poll under the 1971 Act. That again was 85 per cent., but it went the wrong way for the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To clear any confusion, will the hon. and learned Gentleman give the Committee the result of the ACAS ballots on recognition? Will he give us the actual figures, because his previous arguments have collapsed like a pack of cards? Will he put on the record exactly what took place, what the percentages were and how many reached over 80 per cent. recognition. Did he say 90 out of 140?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall do so as soon as I have the figures to hand. I cannot do so at the moment, but I undertake to give them to the hon. Gentleman if I do not put them on the record.<br><br>
Of the most recent ballots, in the British Leyland recovery plan poll, 80 per cent. of all those entitled to vote voted in favour; in the NUM's latest pay ballot, 87 per cent. of those entitled to vote voted in favour, and the 1972 railwaymen's vote was 85 per cent.<br><br>
We believe that in these circumstances the case for the clause is well made out and that it ought to stand part of the Bill.</span></p>

<p>6.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Radice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly because I do not feel that that was a complete answer to the case made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley).<br><br>
The fact is that closed shops are increasing in number. They are popular with employers. The evidence of the University of Warwick survey showed that in most recent closed shops in manufacturing industry the employers took the initiative. That will be accepted by the hon. and learned Gentleman. That gives employees additional strength and removes one cause of industrial relations disputes.<br><br>
There is a good case for closed shops. The hon. and learned Gentleman's case is that there must be exemptions and protections for the individual. He does not accept the evidence contained in the survey carred out by his own Department, which, as he admitted, shows that most of the recent UMAs contain conscience clauses, rights for existing non-trade unionists, and are flexible and have properly laid out procedures. He does not seem to want to encourage this development. Instead he wants to legislate.<br><br>
We think that the better approach would be to rely on the good sense of employers and trade unionists to try to enable the TUC advice to be pushed forward. If the Secretary of State feels more is needed, there is the possibility of a code of practice.<br><br>
The problem about legislation has been shown very well by our debates during the last few days. How does one define "conscience"? How does one define "deeply held conviction"? Employers and trade unionists can get together to decide what that means because they know the people concerned, but in a court of law it is far more difficult, as I am sure the hon. and learned Gentleman knows. That is a difficult problem which could be an encouragement for free riders. It could be an encouragement for the friends of the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst). I am sure that very quickly he will be testing out in the courts what this clause means. I believe he will encourage some of the early cases if this legislation goes through.<br><br>
There is the problem of encouragement of multi-unionism, because it is not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 914</span>
a question of being a member of any trade union but of a particular trade union. That worries both employers and trade unions.<br><br>
As my right hon. and hon. Friends have said, there is the problem of the tough hurdle erected in the face of closed shops which will have to be negotiated in the future. For all these reasons, it is much 'better to rely on a voluntary approach, perhaps aided by a code of practice, rather than to get oneself into this quagmire or minefield, whatever epithet one might use, of law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was tempted to contribute to this clause stand part debate. I thought that I should exercise restraint—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. Will my right hon. Friend speak up?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think, Mr. Leadbitter, that my hon. Friend will understand shortly why I was not raising my voice. I decided that I should bite my tongue and contain the words that I might otherwise have inflicted upon the Committee until the hon. and learned Gentleman decided that he would deliver a cheap sneer about the fact that I speak up somewhat robustly and express strong feelings on the issues that are before the Committee.<br><br>
It is that as much as anything which provoked me. My pattern of life and my professional experience, such as it is, does not enable me to simulate the deadpan zombie style which apparently is so much valued and praised in the courts.<br><br>
I have not the slightest doubt that the experience of this Government will be the same as that of the Government. presided over by the right hon. Member for Sidcup (Mr. Heath) and the experience of the noble lord Lord Carr when they sought to introduce not dissimilar legislation. Despite the closed shop it continued and flourished with the encouragement of employers.<br><br>
Furthermore, during the passage of the Industrial Relations Bill I97I the Government had to face up to the reality of industrial relations and make, I 'believe for the first time in any statute, specific provision that recognised and allowed the existence of what were then
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0992">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 915</span>
called closed shops—not the more flexible approach of the union membership agreement. Same of the Committee may recall the schedules that were introduced on Report and in the House of Lords proceedings that made provision for what were described as "approved" closed shops. I wonder whether the Government have borne in mind that situation, when it had to be recognised that there was a legitimate and overwhelming case for workers to be organised into closed shops.<br><br>
Once or twice during our proceedings on the clause, comparisons have been made with the provisions of United Kingdom law and practice and the experience and law of other countries. I refer to a survey that was carried out by the <i>Industrial Relations Review</i> in May I976 of practice in eight countries in Europe. The survey showed that closed shops operate in 'certain sectors in Belgium, Denmark and Ireland as well as in the United Kingdom and that union membership agreements operate in the Netherlands, even though in the first three countries I mentioned closed shops are technically unlawful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman says, "Hear, hear," but at the same time I hope he recognises that, despite their illegality, they continue and flourish.<br><br>
In America, where only about 20 per cent. of the work force is in union membership, post-entry closed shops are widespread. When in July last year, I visited a machinery manufacturing establishment in Chicago, almost the first question I asked the managing director on being taken around was what proportion of his work force was unionised. He said that everyone working there, as a matter of obligation with his contract, had to be a member of the United Automobile Workers of the United States.<br><br>
I said, "You operate a closed shop then." He said, "I don't know what you mean by a closed shop. All that I can tell you is that every guy who goddam works here has to be a member of the goddam UAW, or he's out." I said, "Supposing somebody has started and undergoes religious conversion or is persuaded that it is wrong for one
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 916</span>
reason or another to belong to the UAW?" He said, "The moment he does that he is in breach of his contract, Mr. Walker. We'd show him the door."<br><br>
That is as far-reaching as any closed shop of which I am aware in the United Kingdom. As we know, closed shops exist in the dock industry in the United States. It is impossible to get a job on either seaboard unless one is a member of, on the eastern seaboard, the International Longshoremen's Association or, on the western seaboard, the association operated by Harry Bridges, the name of which escapes me. In the building industry, the construction industry, and motor manufacturing, closed shops run in the United States, as they do in several Western European countries.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman quoted various sources that have been invoked in aid by both sides of the Committee. I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will recall what the Church of England said about the closed shop. I think that some of the most powerful arguments in favour of the closed shop were advanced in the name of the Church of England by a special committee of the General Synod set up to look into the question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh, that one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But I understood, from the way in which this issue is being argued, that we were talking about moral values. I thought that we had been talking about moral behaviour, moral principles and ethical considerations, as well as about the practicalities of industrial relations. If the hon. and learned Gentleman dismisses the Church of England in that way, we must make our own judgment.<br><br>
When we discuss trade union recognition and the closed shop, we are talking about the recognition of a trade union by an employer for purposes of collective bargaining. But that is not the only reason why someone joins a trade union, and that is not the only purpose of a trade union.<br><br>
I hope it is common ground in the Committee that underlying our whole industrial relations system is a belief in collective bargaining conducted by strong trade unions. But even if a union is not recognised or accepted by the employer for collective bargaining pur-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0993">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 917</span>
poses, members of that union may wish their union to act as an advocate on their behalf in their individual relationships with their employer and in any possible conflicts with him.<br><br>
I welcome the right hon. Gentleman's affirmation that, even though a union may not be recognised, either because it does not represent the appropriate percentage of workers—in a closed shop—or because it has not gone through the recognition procedures under the employment protection legislation, and even though the employer does not want to recognise it, employers should be encouraged to allow unions to act on behalf of their members in a representational capacity.<br><br>
When a minority of trade unionists are employed at a particular establishment, one of them may run into conflict with the employer. It may be a case of a suspension or a dismissal, or any disciplinary situation. The worker may say, "I want my chap to come in to represent me". In those circumstances it would be right for the employer to allow that representation, and for the Government to encourage the employer to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee for more than a couple of minutes, but I must express my disappointment that neither the hon. and learned Gentleman nor his right hon. Friend have done anything to explain how they reconcile their oft-repeated belief in the need for an overwhelming majority with the demand—on which they positively insist—that the formula must relate to a percentage of the electorate, not to a percentage of those voting. In my view they have not explained their case at all.<br><br>
It seems to me, as it must seem to most reasonable people, that the proper way to define an overwhelming majority, whatever percentage may be required, is to look at the ratio between those voting one way and those voting the other way. That seems to me to be the most simple and straightforward way to decide whether or not a majority is overwhelming.<br><br>
Whether or not one accepts a ratio of two to one as overwhelming is a matter of personal choice, but it must be the ratio between those voting one way and those voting the other way that one considers. I do not understand why Ministers are so insistent that the formula
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 918</span>
must relate to those eligible to vote rather than to those voting.<br><br>
I would like to hear a specific reply to the question which has been raised on the hypothesis of a 79 per cent. vote in favour of a UMA and a 21 per cent. abstention—or even a 16 per cent. abstention and 5 per cent. voting against. Is that an overwhelming majority, or not?</span></p>
<p>6.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall gladly answer both questions. I am sorry if I neglected to do so previously. I thought that I had dealt with the first of them.<br><br>
The reason why we stipulated 80 per cent. of the total electorate is that everybody is affected by the outcome, whether or not they all vote. The result will bear in a material way on their individual liberty. That is why we say—exceptionally, perhaps, in democratic practice—that the majority should be of the total electorate, not of those voting.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman illustrated his argument with a hypothetical case. For the very reason that I have given, the majority would not be adequate. Even though 79 per cent. of the electorate voted in favour, nobody voted against and the remainder abstained, the test would not be met.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I let this point go because it appeared to me that the question dealt in a very large way with the principle of the clause. I hope, nevertheless, that the Committee will be mindful that we have debated the details line by line. For its own sake, the Committee ought to remember that we are now discussing the general principle, not the detail.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee long. As you have correctly advised the Committee, Mr. Leadbitter, we have had a fair and leisurely debate on the various subsections of clause 6, and our amendments have been discussed in some detail, as they should have been.<br><br>
I shall not address myself to any of the amendments. I rise only to make the general point that clause 6 is one of the many bad hearts of a thoroughly evil Bill which, far from improving industrial relationships in this country, will create chaos and havoc. The hypocrisy of the Tory Party proclaiming its belief in the rights and freedom of the individual is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0994">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 919</span>
one of the most nauseous things I have heard. Over many years, its record of protecting the individual has been appalling. During the course of this Parliament so far the Tory Party has already added to its appalling record in many areas—particularly on race relations, the rights of the sexes, and the treatment of the low paid, the recipients of social security benefits, and the increasing numbers of unemployed. I forecast that in the not-too-distant future, probably in the next Budget, the Government will take action which will have a further detrimental effect on all the minorities in this country—minorities which the Conservative Party totally ignores.<br><br>
It is nauseating to hear Conservative Members trotting out their belief in the rights and freedom of the individual. They have no concern whatsoever for the individual. They are concerned only about what the Tory Party has always been concerned about—shackling the trade unions, and doing their damnedest to ensure that they will not be a force for good in this country, but that they will be pushed around and that their voices will not be heard.<br><br>
There is no real difference between the views of the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst), the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State. Only the degree of their hatred for the trade union movement divides them. There is no belief in or feeling for the trade union movement. There is no respect for the struggles of the working people of this country over many years. Clause 6 goes to the heart of the matter. In it the Conservatives are seeking to destroy one of the most important principles of the trade union movement—the right to establish a closed shop.<br><br>
I forecast that thousands of closed shops—not union membership agreements, but 100 per cent. closed shops—will not be affected one iota by the Bill, despite all the provisions about people getting compensation because they have been dismissed, or allowing the easy riders to drop out of the trade union. The trade union movement in the stronger areas of this country will totally ignore the Bill, as it ignored the 1971 Act. The problem will be in those areas where people are struggling for trade union rights—struggling to build up a strong union which will benefit them and their
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 920</span>
families. Those are the areas that clause 6 will affect.<br><br>
Notwithstanding our previous debates, clause 6 is irrelevant. The Secretary of State made that clear earlier. The message must go out from this Committee that trade unions that are seeking to make union membership agreements with employers must make sure that they have good relations with employers. To use the Secretary of State's words, once they establish, with or without the ballot, a closed shop agreement with an employer, new applicants for work in that plant will be refused admittance on the basis that they are not prepared to join the union. If they are prepared to join, they will be allowed in and welcomed as individuals working in the plant, so the closed shop will grow.<br><br>
There is also a clear message to the unions to ensure that in future all dealings at local level apply only to members of the unions. We shall then see who are the free riders. Clause 6 is concerned with the free riders whose objection is based on conscience or other deeply-held personal convictions. That deeply-held personal conviction often means not wanting to put a hand in the pocket to pay the 25p or 30p a week union dues. If the Secretary of State and the Tory Party think that the trade union movement will stand by and allow the free riders to take over what the unions have fought for throughout many years, they had better think again—and write another Bill.<br><br>
I hope that the Government will recognise that. Clause 6 will stand part of the Bill, but it is important for the Opposition to send the message to the trade union movement that the Secretary of State has indicated that clause 6 is irrelevant and that they can ignore it and get round it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Previously I had a couple of sentences to say, now I have three or four. What deeply offends me are the words

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member proceeds, may I say a word to him? He was out of the room earlier. We have considered our approach to the clause stand part debate in the sense of applying ourselves to the principles. Where we have debated the details of each subsection it would not be helpful for the Committee to go over the same ground
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0995">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 921</span>
again, unless in some way hon. Members can use their ingenuity to relate that to the principles.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for having been unavoidably absent on account of an engagement that was arranged two months ago. If I stray, Mr. Leadbitter, I am sure that you will pull me up.<br><br>
I want to know the nature of the beast that is before us, whether it is a mouse or an elephant, whether it is something important—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A rhinoceros.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—whether it will apply in many cases or in just a few.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary gave a pedigree for the things he wants to introduce. He quoted from the 1969 White Paper "In Place of Strife" which, on that point stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"Before agreeing to a closed shop employers should seek to obtain suitable protection for people who refuse to join trade unions on conscientious grounds."</p></blockquote>
He made that claim and we would all consider that reasonable.<br><br>
He also referred to the TUC's advice in its guidance which stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"It should be recognised that for many years, unions, voluntarily and without any legal requirement, have made provision for conscientious objectors to be excluded from the closed shop provisions, but in some cases on the understanding that they make an equivalent payment to charity."</p></blockquote>
So there is a pedigree for conscience, and for religious views. But this has been extended, and I wonder how far.<br><br>
The Under Secretary reminded the Committee at a previous sitting that under the 1974 Act there was the much wider criterion of reasonable grounds for not belonging to a union. He said that 23 cases were heard by tribunals during the period of approximately 16 months when that was the law. Of those 23 cases, 16 were successful and the remainder withdrawn or not successful. That was merely 16 people. Are we talking of something as small as that? I do not think so.<br><br>
As I understand the new words
<br><blockquote><p>"or other deeply-held personal conviction"</p></blockquote>
it could go much further. The hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst), asked whether being a member of the Conservative Party would be reasonable grounds for not belonging to a trade union if in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 922</span>
the constitution drawn up by idealists years ago there was reference to the desirability of a Socialist society. The Under Secretary, who is now absent, with his natural aversion for blunt, guttural, monosyllabic, Anglo Saxon, did not say "Yes" or "No". He said that such a case could be caught by the Government's formulation in the subsection. So that seems to open up a whole new field.<br><br>
As was explained to us, there is no such thing as a right to strike in British law. We give immunities to people who take actions during a strike that would otherwise be illegal. This provision would say that the closed shop will not be illegal, but we will give immunities. So if one is a member of the Conservative Party, that is an immunity. The hon. Member for Hendon, North, nods his head.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope it is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He hopes that is what it means. Does the Secretary of State agree with his hon. and learned Friend? The Secretary of State said that there ought to be a conscience let-out. Members of the Committee may think that I exaggerate. May I quote a dispassionate witness which has already been quoted by my right hon. Friend? The Industrial Relations Services have this to say about the grounds for objection:
<br><blockquote><p>"The phrasing is so broad that the more interesting question is likely to be: what grounds do not fall within the protection?"</p></blockquote>
So what is being said is that virtually any grounds, any deeply-held conviction, will be enough. That will drive a coach and horses through the closed shop, which is what the hon. Member for Hendon, North, wants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He will be driving it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He will be in the driver's seat, lashing the horses on and encouraging others to do likewise.<br><br>
Will the Secretary of State say how he sees this? Will it be merely a tidying up, or a similar thing which will bring forward 16 cases, or does he see it as a major attack on the closed shop? As far as we are concerned, if anyone has deeply-held personal convictions he can put it forward freely at our meetings. He does not need to go to the courts. Our affairs are decided democratically anyway. I see no need for those extra words. I am
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0996">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 923</span>
worried about them. They are so broad that they could bring forth hundreds or even thousands of cases. We all know that there are millions of Conservative trade unionists. Are we saying that they should all be able to opt out of union membership agreements?</span></p>
<p>7 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I seek not to wind up the debate at this stage but to reply to the hon. Gentleman's question about the number of cases—he asked whether we were talking in terms of 16 cases or of hundreds or thousands of cases. I hope, and have always hoped, that the result of the clause will turn not so much on the effect that the law will have if it has to be enforced as on the conditioning effect that it will have on the management of union membership agreements and of closed shops. In future, when the whole question of conscience is being considered the tolerance that used to be part of closed shop arrangements but has not been so much in evidence in recent years will once more tend to prevail. People will not be forced into belonging. Conscience, therefore, will be able to be exercised in a reasonable manner.<br><br>
I should regard it as a failure if countless cases were to come before industrial tribunals. The clause is an attempt to condition attitudes in a reasonable and fair manner. We hope that there will not be many cases. That is why my hon. and learned Friend was so careful in his use of words I have just been checking what he said. I do not think that there will be many cases, although I can think of one or two—certainly last winter—that undoubtedly would have fallen within the "deeply-held personal conviction" or "conscience" range. But we have to leave most of that to the tribunals. I wished simply to tell that hon. Gentleman that I do not see the matter quite in the light that he suggested.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the clause is a contribution to the "softly, softly" approach to industrial relations I hesitate to visualise the hard-line approach. The provisions present a choice between death by a thousand cuts and instant extermination. They niggle away at the trade union movement in an endeavour to make it impotent in representing the interests of its members.<br><br>
Throughout the discussion on the clause
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 924</span>
the Opposition have not had are adequate response from the Government to the problems that we have posed. We have asked for examples of how the conscience clause will be interpreted by the tribunals. We have put before the Government examples of cases that may be brought. But we have had no adequate answers. There is no doubt that the tribunals will interpret the wording in a wide manner. People will become exempt from trade union membership for all sorts of bizarre reasons.<br><br>
We have had no answers on the question of the closed shop, on the question of ballots, on how the negotiations will be conducted, on what type of ballots will be held, or on what kind of protection work people will have in the circumstances that we have described. We have certainly not had an answer to our question: what is a democratic ballot? It now seems that the Government are well on the way to devising a system that requires one to obtain 101 per cent. of the votes in order to win.<br><br>
It seems to me preposterous that the trade union movement should be placed in the special position of having to obtain a large preponderance of the votes. In essence the requirement will be more than 80 per cent. Taking into account those who are away on holiday or absent because of ill-health or indifference, it may be as high as 90 per cent. That is the obstacle that new closed shops will have to surmount before they can obtain a union recognition agreement.<br><br>
All that will happen is that many employers will ignore the provisions of the clause. They will not negotiate closed shop agreements. Instead we shall see the position that already exists in many factories where the management recognises 100 per cent.—or something approaching it—trade union membership. No formal negotiations are entered into, no formal recognition given to the closed shop. Nevertheless, employers practice the closed shop.<br><br>
If our experience of the Industrial Relations Act 1971 is any guide employers will ignore this part of the Bill. Many below-the-counter agreements will be entered into so that unions may be recognised without going through the formality of negotiations in order to reach agreement. When the Industrial Relations Bill was being discussed the Opposition prophesied that it would lead to industrial
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0997">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 925</span>
unrest. History proved that we were right. There were three times as many strikes in 1973–74 as in any year since the general strike of 1926.<br><br>
We now prophesy that when the Bill becomes an Act we shall see further industrial unrest. Rather than making a contribution to industrial peace, the Bill is inflaming trade unionists against the Government. On 9 March there is to be a demonstration in London. I ask hon. Members to gauge the resentment that exists by the tens of thousands of people who will participate in that demonstration. The demonstration against the Industrial Relations Act attracted 150,000 trade unionists. It was the largest demonstration to take place in this country since Chartist times. The trade union movement will be mobilised against the Bill.<br><br>
It is no good the Secretary of State trying to convince us that the Bill represents a "softly, softly" approach. It undermines the position of the trade union</span></p>

EXCLUSION OF RIGHTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now come to amendment No. 129 and the amendments grouped with it: Nos. 99, 105, 100, 106, 104, 102, 130, 103, and 131.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I do not complain of your selection of amendments and the way in which they have been grouped, but I protest, as strongly as I can, about the Government's treatment of the Committee. At a late stage, with little prior warning and little opportunity for our amendments to be correspondingly adjusted, the Government have sprung on</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 926</span>
<p>movement. It brings resentments back into the factory. It creates acrimony where none existed. That will rebound on the Government. However they like to describe their approach to industrial relations, the clause is one more nail in the coffin of the Tory Government. They were discredited after the Industrial Relations Act. Solemn pledges were made that that Act would never be reintroduced. Yet here we see another Bill niggling away at trade union rights, perhaps to be followed by further legislation at a later stage.</p>
<p>I warn the Government that the Bill will create chaos in the factories. If they had any sense they would start thinking again about the clause, even at this late hour.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 13, Noes 10.</p>
<p>us a major change in the Bill. Our amendments have been largely invalidated by the change. I protest that we have had inadequate time to revise our amendments in the light of the changes that have been made by the Government.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Chair has noted the point. However, unfortunately, it is not a point for the Chair. No doubt the Secretary of State and Government Members will have taken note of what has been said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 129, in page 8, line 34, leave out from beginning to end of line 7 on page 9 and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"Extended qualifying period where no more than twenty employees.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>64A.—(1) Subject to subsection (2), section 54 does not apply to the dismissal of an employee from any employment if—

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that with this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I say at once to the right hon. Gentleman who has just protested that I am sorry for the short notice given to the Committee. We felt that an amendment from my hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Madel), ought to be seriously considered. But when we looked at it we found that it was defective. Therefore it was more appropriate for us to put down a major amendment which constituted a redrawing of the clause in the way in which it has now been done.<br><br>
The purpose of the amendment is to replace the two-year exemption from unfair dismissal for new small firms with a two-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 928</span>
year qualifying period of service for making a complaint of unfair dismissal for new employees of all small firms.<br><br>
The amendment also makes other changes to clause 7(1). The limit on the size of firms covered by the provision is raised to include firms with 20 employees. Previously it would have applied only to firms with fewer than 20 employees. The reason we made that change is that the intention did not seem to be quite clear before.<br><br>
Under the original clause an undertaking qualified for the exemption only if at no time had it exceeded the cut-off level. Under the amendment an employer will qualify so long as he does not have more than 20 employees during the period of the employment of the employee whose dismissal is being considered.<br><br>
Finally, there is a relatively minor alteration to the basis for determining whether an employer comes within the scope of the provision. The employees to be taken into account when assessing an employer's eligibility will be the number of his employees, added to the number employed by any associated employer rather than, as it was formerly, the number of employees employed in the undertaking.<br><br>
I should point out that the amendment carries forward two major elements of the original clause. The first is the requirement in paragraph (<i>c</i>) that employers notify new employees, in writing, on engagement, of the effect of the provision. However, that differs slightly from the original clause, which required that the notification should include the date on which the exemption would expire.<br><br>
The reason for that change is that for each employee the qualifying period should now be much clearer as it will end two years after the date on which he was first employed. The second is the provision in the new section 64A(2), which is not amended and of course is contained in the Bill, that the extended qualifying period does not apply to dismissals on grounds of trade union membership or activities, for which there is no qualifying period, and dismissals on certain medical grounds under the statutes listed in schedule 1 of the 1978 Act, for which it remains at four weeks.<br><br>
7.15 p.m.<br><br>
I believe it is right, even at this stage, to make the change that we have made. We
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0999">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 929</span>
have had a number of criticisms—as well as the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, South—to the effect that, if we really wished to help small firms, particularly in the psychology of employment, it was important that it should be not just new small firms but all small firms. We concluded that the exemption for new small firms would be too limited in its effect, and that, with suitable safeguards, it would be right to extend it to all small firms. That is why we made the change.<br><br>
In so many cases with small employers, it is the psychological aspect that is important. It is the anecdotal evidence more than the practical evidence—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is none.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a good deal of statistical evidence also. It is the oft-expressed view of small firms which, hon. Gentlemen must have heard time and again, that they will not take on additional people. At a time of high and rising unemployment, it has always seemed right to us to do everything we could to encourage small firms and small employers at least to feel that there was no bar in this respect to their employment of more people.<br><br>
The clause, as amended, is still strictly limited. It does not change the status of employees dismissed on trade union grounds, for which there is no qualifying period. We have no intention of denying employees in small firms the right to join a trade union or to take an active part in it without fear of dismissal. We are leaving unchanged, as I have said, the qualifying period of protection against dismissal on medical grounds under the statutes in schedule 1 of the Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman tell us where the evidence is to which he has referred—he mentioned particularly statistical evidence—relating to new small firms?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is hard to state where the evidence exists for new small firms until new small firms have come into operation. Certainly it is a fact that people in Britain are much too reluctant to set up new small firms, simply because they believe that the employment protection legislation has a debilitating effect. That is much more so here than in a number of other countries.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 930</span>
Our record on small firms is probably worse than that of almost any other advanced country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not true.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When one thinks of the enormous growth of new small firms in the United States, as set out in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology study, it is not hard to see that we ought to be doing far more to encourage new small firms, and small firms generally, than we have done. Surely all members of the Committee can agree with the considerable importance of getting on with that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I put two points to the right hon. Gentleman? First, he was not present—for reasons which are wholly understandable—when this Committee had a long discussion on the research commissioned by the Department of Employment. I do not wish to rehearse all the arguments, but I wish the right hon. Gentleman would read the record of that debate. He would then see that his assertions about the impact of employment legislation on small firms is not sustained by the available evidence.<br><br>
Secondly, will the right hon. Gentleman tell us when the new provision, if it is enacted, will start? Clearly, if the Committee and the House approve the Bill and the new proposal becomes operative within 12 months, a number of employees who joined small firms and assumed that they had certain statutory rights will be stripped of those statutory rights.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In reply to the right hon. Gentleman's last point, the answer is that they will simply continue to have them. Any employee of a small firm with fewer than 20 employees has the full statutory rights that he has at the moment. I am coming to this point in my speech, but I shall answer the right hon. Gentleman now. It does not make the slightest difference to an existing employee engaged under those terms of reference. He continues to be employed under them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman tell me where that safeguard is written in? Because it is not in what I have before me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that point in the course of my remarks.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1000">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 931</span>
Another important safeguard in the original clause which we have carried forward into our amendment is the requirement that employers notify new employees on engagement of the effect of the two-year qualifying period. This is an important point. We shall make this requirement very plain in the literature. So long as small employers get to hear of it through our publicity and their employers' associations, I cannot see that it would constitute much of a burden to them when compared with the advantages of the longer qualifying period. We shall have to make it clear to employers exactly what "on being engaged" means. That is the point when the employer and the employee decide that he should join—not necessarily when he starts work.<br><br>
The purpose of the notification is to ensure that, before someone joins a small firm, he knows about the longer qualifying period. We do not want dismissed employees realising only when they try to make a complaint, and possibly after incurring legal expenses, that they are not covered because of the size of their employer. The provision will not operate to deprive existing employees of their rights.<br><br>
How can paragraph (<i>c</i>) of our amendment No. 129 apply to an employee already taken on? Paragraph (<i>c</i>) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"the dismissed employee was on being engaged informed in writing of the effect of this section."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, this must cover all new employees. I shall return to the point of when it comes into operation in a minute.<br><br>
The amendment has the advantage of making the clause much clearer. By limiting the original exemption to new firms, we use the term "undertaking" to avoid spurious changes of name or ownership qualifying a firm for exemption.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman define what "undertaking" means?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I nolonger have to, because we are taking it out. We think that it is clearer to take it out. As my notes go on to say,
<br><blockquote><p>"This term has been questioned".</p></blockquote>
The amendment is much clearer because it uses the terms "employer" and "associated employer" which occur elsewhere in the legislation.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 932</span>
I am sure that Opposition Members will also have spotted that these terms are wider than "undertaking". By that I mean that some firms that would have been treated separately under the original clause for the purpose of calculating the number of employees will now be added together, thereby benefiting their employees. In other words, an employer and associated employers will be added together, whereas undertakings might be separate undertakings. Therefore, more people might come under the two-year provision than appears to be the case.<br><br>
The amendment also renders unnecessary amendment No. 103, which seeks to protect the rights of employees transferred between separate undertakings owned by the same employer or associated employers. The position of each firm and employee should, therefore, be much clearer to all concerned, including the industrial tribunals.<br><br>
The cut-off point for the amendment is 20 employees. As I said, that differs slightly from the Bill as published. The Bill talked of not exceeding 19 employees— that is, under 20. There has been some confusion over the precise cut-off. To counter that, we have made it 20 or under. That means that firms up to 20 employees will benefit from the clause. That will be rather easier to explain to employers and employees who will have the figure of 20 fixed in their minds.<br><br>
The figure of 20 is somewhat arbitrary, but we believe it to be about right. We were under pressure to make it higher. There is also an amendment to reduce it to five. Firms with above 20 employees are more likely to have more than one tier of management, while in smaller firms there may be only a single manager with responsibility for personnel matters alongside everything else and with direct contact with all his staff.<br><br>
It is interesting that the practice varies enormously from country to country. For example, Germany and Italy give complete exemption to small firms from their unfair dismissal provisions, not merely longer qualifying periods. In Italy, that covers not only firms with 35 employees or under, but also production units of 15 or under. In Germany, it applies to firms of five or under. In France, employees of firms of under 10 qualify only for wrongful dismissal provisions. It should also be remembered that in Germany young people under
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1001">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 933</span>
18 years of age are also not covered for unfair dismissal. So I believe that the figure we have chosen is reasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman will appreciate that we shall anxiously await the next <i>Official Report</i> of our proceedings because we are having some difficulty in understanding what he is saying. My difficulty is that the Secretary of State waxed lyrical in his opening remarks about the effect that employment protection legislation has on the small employer. He is arguing that to remove the small employer from the provisions will have a magnificent effect in increasing the number of small employers. But, surely, if the right hon. Gentleman's argument is correct, small firms will stick at 20. There will be no incentive to go from 20 to 21 because, as soon as they do that, they will be affected by all the pernicious provisions of the employment legislation. Instead of helping the growth of the small firms, it will hinder them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that the hon. Gentleman is on a very good point there. Whereas the two-year qualifying period may encourage small firms which are currently scared to expand, I doubt whether employers will seriously be reluctant to cross the 20-employee cut-off. The two-year qualifying period is what matters. Presumably, most employees will stay with the employer for two years or more, and once they have stayed for that time they are in any case subject to the unfair dismissal provisions which operate. In our view, firms will be willing to expand.<br><br>
I shall now explain briefly the effect of the other Government amendments Nos. 130
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 934</span>
and 131. Amendment No. 130 deletes subsection 64(A)(3), which said that the exemption would apply only to firms taking on their first employee after the Act came into force. The amended clause will be brought into force by an order under the commencement provisions in clause 18. I should like to make it clear that this provision will in no way affect employees already in their jobs when it comes into force.<br><br>
Amendment No. 131 ensures that, for the purpose of this provision, if an employee is dismissed with less than his statutory notice, his continuous employment is taken to continue until the date on which his statutory notice would have expired. This will prevent employers from trying to dismiss someone without proper notice in order to benefit from the provision.<br><br>
In conclusion, to allay the fears expressed about how this provision will operate in practice, I should say that we have taken powers to amend it by order. If any problems emerge, we will look at it again. For this reason, I ask the Committee to accept these amendments, because I believe that they will be of far greater help to small employers and small businesses than was the original proposal.<br><br>
I think, Mr. Leadbitter, that this might be a suitable time for the Committee to adjourn, if only to give the hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) a chance to read in <i>Hansard</i> what I have said so that he may be able to reply on Thursday morning.</span></p>
<p>Debate adjourned.—[<i>Mr. Prior.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Adjourned accordingly at half-past Seven o'clock till Thursday 6 March at half-past Ten o'clock.</i></p>
