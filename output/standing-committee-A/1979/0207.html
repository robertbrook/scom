<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>EMPLOYMENT BILL</h1></div>
<p>10:30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: During our proceedings on Tuesday, reference was made by several hon. Members to a case which was said to be before the courts. I then ruled that
<br><blockquote><p>"It would be wise to stick to the role of the certification officer and try not to get involved in too many cases which may be pending"—</p></blockquote>
and further that—
<br><blockquote><p>"When a case is before the courts reference may be made to it but we are in danger of influencing the outcome if we go into details."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 5 February 1980; c. 192.]</p></blockquote>
Those rulings may have given rise to some misunderstanding, and it may therefore help the Committee if I make clear that in principle there is no restriction on reference to matters which may be pending or before the courts, since the sub judice rule does not apply to proceedings on Bills. It is, however, the duty of the Chair to ensure that the debates of the Committee are directly relevant to the Questions before the Committee, and I shall continue to endeavour to carry out that duty. I apologise to the members of the Committee if I misled them in any way when speaking last Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to your statement, Mr. Goodhew, for which I am most grateful, may I add a further word of explanation, namely, that this matter could not have been sub judice in the first place because a ruling of Mr. Justice O'Connor on 14 December stated that a trade union cannot sue in its own name for libel.<br><br>
But further to that, and more particularly, Mr. Goodhew, may I draw your attention to the fact that no writ had at that stage been issued and still—to the best of my knowledge and information this morning—has not been issued. Therefore, I believe it fair to say that the hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher) was misleading not only you, Mr. Goodhew, but the Committee in what
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 214</span>
he said. The facts were not as he stated and the consequences that he suggested to you did not flow from them, even if they had been true.<br><br>
As the matter has not been drawn to the attention of the Attorney-General, and one of my hon. Friends is asking him to refer the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions, we clearly do not wish to pursue it any further in this Committee, but there are two attempts on the Order Paper to silence this subject and I wish to take this opportunity to say that I have absolutely no intention of allowing a matter of this sort of corruption to silence an ordinary Member of Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to know that not only the Chair makes mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eric G. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On another point of order, Mr. Goodhew. On two occasions, as you will recall, I have tried to raise with the Government the question of the consultative document which they are to produce, arising out of their consideration of the judgment in Express Newspapers v. MacShane. You were kind enough last week to accept a motion from me that the debate be adjourned. I have no intention of trying to persuade you that we ought to do that this morning, but I wonder whether, through you, Mr. Good-hew, the Under-Secretary could tell us what has happened.<br><br>
It was perfectly clear on Tuesday, when the Secretary of State addressed the Committee, that the Government are preparing proposals and they will issue a consultative document within the next few das—that appears in col. 173 of the <i>Official Report</i>—and that each member of the Committee will have a copy of the proposals before they are issued to the general public.<br><br>
From what we hear on the radio and read in the newspapers, there is again considerable confusion about this matter. In <i>The Times</i> this morning, Mr. Fred Emery writes:
<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Prior had wanted his paper published this week"—</p></blockquote>
which would have assisted this Committee considerably, and there is no doubt that that is in line with the Secretary of State's statement to the Committee on Tuesday—and further down Mr. Emery says:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0618">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 215</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"He was apparently asked by ministers diagreeing with his cautious approach to present tougher options … The matter will not now come before today's Cabinet meeting, and the Government's 'green' paper"—that means consultative document, no doubt—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"is unlikely to be ready before the end of next month."</p></blockquote>
If we are to consider this Bill but we are not to have the Green Paper, which would be of considerable assistance to us, it will make life intolerable. I hope, Mr. Good-hew, that if you have not been informed when we are likely to receive these amendments from the Government, at least the Under-Secretary will be able to say something to us this morning to clear up this confusion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is perfectly right in saying that my right hon. Friend indicated at our last sitting that we were in course of preparing a consultative paper and that he hoped to issue it in the next few days. I myself have given an undertaking that when it was issued it would be put before this Committee before being published.<br><br>
The object of a consultative paper is to set out certain options, and the more options it contains the wider the basis for consultation. The position remains that the consultative paper will be published as soon as possible. No indication was given that it would be published today.<br><br>
The Committee will no doubt recall that the Prime Minister, in her "Weekend World" interview a fortnight or so ago, indicated that the Government were determined to get this complex field of industrial law right. The Government's position is that it is still our intention to produce first for this Committee the consultative paper when we are fully satisfied that it sets out the options that we wish it to contain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Goodhew. The question-begging phrase in what the hon. and learned Gentleman has just said is "as soon as possible". I am sure that that is the intention, but the timing is very much a matter which affects the work of this Committee. "As soon as possible" might be a week, it might be three months. What sort of situation shall we be in if in several weeks we are still debating amendments
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 216</span>
all of which may be turned into arrant nonsense as a result either of what is in the consultative document or decisions taken arising out of the consultative document?<br><br>
There is a considerable danger that the Government are wasting your time, Mr. Goodhew, and the time of all the members of the Committee. I can understand the Under-Secretary not being too well informed about this today—he may be better informed this afternoon—but if it transpires that it will be some weeks before the Green Paper is issued, is there not a serious case for suspending the proceedings of the Committee until it is published and consideration has been given to it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is not a matter for the Chair. It is purely a matter for the Government. I think that we should get on with the Bill. We have a considerable way to go before we reach the matters which will be the subject of the consultative paper. If we get into dangerous waters where we are running up against the time when we should need the consultative paper to enable us to do our work, obviously I should make representations. But I do not wish to go over the whole debate we had on Tuesday. I think that the position is clearly understood, we have had an undertaking, and I hope that we can get on in the meantime with the part of the Bill which is not affected by such a paper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I refer, Mr. Goodhew, to your statement at the beginning of our meeting this morning with regard to whether the allegations that are being made against APEX are now subjudice? I understood at the time that the union had approached legal advisers and that action was to be taken. I am now seeking your guidance, Mr. Goodhew, as to whether when the writ has been issued, or when legal action has been taken, this matter can then be referred to or whether it is sub judice at that time.<br><br>
It seems that statements can be made during our committee proceedings which, if made outside the House, would be the subject of legal action. The hon. Member for Hendon, (Mr. Gorst) referred to "corruption" this morning. If that statement had been made outside the privilege accorded to Members of Parliament, he would be in a serious position. Indeed, I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0619">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 217</span>
challenge him to make those statements outside the protection of privilege in the House. He will get into serious trouble if he does.<br><br>
I hope, Mr. Goodhew, that you will use your discretion in seeing that this matter is not referred to during any proceedings that might follow. Otherwise, we shall have to investigate the so-called allegations in the Committee and not allow the court an opportunity to decide whether APEX is right in suggesting that these statements and allegations are fabrications and lies. That puts those of us on the trade union side in an invidious position. We are discussing a matter about which hon. Gentlemen do not have all the facts, and we are not acting as a judicial body. I therefore suggest that it would be wise if the Committee did not refer to this matter pending legal action which is now to be taken by the union.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I made clear in my statement at the beginning of this sitting that the sub judice rule does not apply to legislation going through the Committee or the House. Therefore, it would be perfectly in order for reference to be made to a case provided that it was related to whatever was before the Committee at the time. Clearly, it cannot just be bandied about as a general stick to wave. I hope that the Chair has now made clear that there is no sub judice rule when it comes to legislation and that, provided that hon. Members are in order in relating what they have to say to the Question before the Committee, I must allow them to speak.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to what you have just said, Mr. Goodhew, which I accept entirely, I seek your guidance as to the propriety—not to say abuse of privilege—of members of the Committee entering into a collusive arrangement with representatives of the press or other sections of the media to exploit Parliamentary privilege, or raise under the immunity granted by Parliamentary privilege matters that would be actionable if uttered outside. It is the question of prior collusion being mooted around which causes some of us anxiety.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is quite right. The Chair would deplore any such efforts.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 218</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point put to you, Mr. Goodhew, could it be made clear that the sub judice ruling applies, in addition to what you have said, only if a date has been set down for hearing in the courts? That also applies whether we are discussing legislation or not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There was a resolution of the House relating to sub judice matters which reads in part that
<br><blockquote><p>"matters awaiting or under adjudication in a civil court should not be referred to"</p></blockquote>
in any motion, debate or question to a Minister
<br><blockquote><p>"from the time that the case has been set down for trial or otherwise brought before the court, as for example by notice of motion for an injunction; such matters may be referred to before such date unless it appears to the Chair that there is a real and substantial danger of prejudice to the trial of the case."</p></blockquote>
That is rather what I was suggesting on Tuesday. But that does not apply to proceedings when we are dealing with legislation. It applies only when the Minister is being asked questions on the Floor of the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the sake of clarity, Mr. Goodhew, may I say that I consulted one of the senior Clerks of the House and he was emphatic that, if no date for a trial had been laid down, under Mr. Speaker's ruling even if a writ had been taken out and we were not discussing legislation it would still be permissible to discuss these matters without offence to the sub judice rule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is correct.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Good, Would it be fair to prejudge any issue that might arise before the court by accusing one of the parties of corruption, as the hon. Gentleman has done this morning, when the facts of the matter have not been discussed at any length? We are setting ourselves up as a judicial tribunal to make observations on one or other of the parties before the matter has even been discussed by an impartial body.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that all that has taken place now only goes to prove that, where possible, one should try not to get
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0620">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 219</span>
involved in these matters unless it is essential in connection with the legislation with which we are dealing.</span></p>
<div class='clause'><span class='label label-warning'>clause</span>
Clause 2</div> <!-- clause -->
<p>Issue by Secretary of State of Codes and Practice.</p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 7 in page 3, line 3, after first 'of', insert 'extending collective bargaining and'.<br><br>
We now come to the part of the Bill which gives the Secretary of State a power which under the present legislation has been reserved for the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service—the power to originate codes of practice. Clause 2(1) sets out the broad parameters of the Secretary of State's scope in this respect. I want to draw the Committee's attention first to the contrast between the terms of reference set out in subsection (1) for the Secretary of State and those set out in Section 1 of the Employment Protection Act 1975 for ACAS.<br><br>
I make clear at the outset that although it might reasonably be inferred from the amendment and what I am about to say, that since we are apparently seeking to extend the scope for the Secretary of State, we are therefore in support of the content of the whole clause. Let me disabuse the Committee of any such assumption right away. As we proceed with our discussions, that will become clear. For my part, I have strong reservations about the powers proposed in the clause.<br><br>
I return to the line that I was developing the comparison with the more restricted scope provided in the Bill before us and that provided for ACAS in the 1975 Act:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Service shall be charged with the general duty of promoting the improvement of industrial relations".</p></blockquote>
So far, the two statutes run in parallel, but then the ACAS terms of reference continue:
<br><blockquote><p>"and in particular of encouraging the extension of collective bargaining and the development and, where necessary, reform of collective bargaining machinery."</p></blockquote>
It was the existence of those words and their subsequent omission from the Government's Bill that made us wonder
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 220</span>
whether the Government were resiling from the principles embodied in the ACAS terms of reference. It is true that over the years there have been controversies arising from what some have seen as a dichotomy between the two parts of the terms of reference of ACAS. Certainly, there have been difficulties, as exemplified in some of the recognition references with which the Service has had to deal.<br><br>
If the Government were having doubts about the wisdom of encouraging the philosophy reflected in the 1975 Act, undoubtedly they would have made provision in their Bill, or subsequently indicated their measure of support or otherwise for amendment No. 29 in the name of the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst). They have not done that, so I assume that they still share the commitment of previous Conservative Governments in recent times to the extension of collective bargaining and the idea that our system of industrial relations should be based on the idea of collective bargaining conducted through strong trade unions.<br><br>
The amendment has further force in the light of the provision in the Bill to repeal the recognition provisions in sections 11 to 16 of the 1975 Act. They are relevant to the principles embodied in our amendment because, when we are talking about the extension and promotion of collective bargaining, we are talking, among other things, about the question of recognition of trade unions.<br><br>
I expressed the view on Second Reading, and shall return to it later, that although the recognition provisions as conceived in the 1975 Act have subsequently been shown to be defective in some respects—and if they were not, they were made defective by court judgments—none the less it would be wholly deplorable for applications by trade unions for recognition by employers not to be conducted through sensible, reasonable machinery. We have seen one or two cases in recent years, and one was alluded to at our last sitting, the Grunwick case. I assure you, Mr. Goodhew, that for for the moment I shall avoid getting too much involved in that case.<br><br>
It would be regrettable if nothing was put in the place of the existing statutory provisions by means of which trade unions could seek, in a peaceful and orderly way, recognition by employers so as to extend the basic concepts on which our industrial
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0621">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 221</span>
relations system is founded, namely, that of collective bargaining conducted through strong trade unions
In the light of experience, we have deliberately sought to avoid one of the difficulties—the particular difficulty may I say—which has been exposed in recognition references dealt with by the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service. That is the difficulty which arose from the insertion in the original terms of reference of ACAS of the words
<br><blockquote><p>"in particular of encouraging the extension of collective bargaining".</p></blockquote>
To illustrate that, I think of the application by the United Kingdom Association of Professional Engineers in the employ of the firm W. H. Allen of Bedford for recognition by that employer as an independent trade union representing a description of workers in the establishment.<br><br>
The employer, not wishing to encourage a proliferation of trade unions in his establishment, not wishing to do anything which might disrupt the existing good industrial relations at that establishment, turned down the application by the United Kingdom Association of Professional Engineers, which then very properly followed the statutory procedure and went to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service.<br><br>
ACAS did what was appropriate. It balloted the group of employees of the appropriate description, and the ballot undoubtedly revealed that a majority of the employees of that description wanted to be represented by the United Kingdom Association of Professional Engineers. I am speaking from memory as I do not have the report with me.<br><br>
In that case, one could have invoked, and this is probably what was done, those provisions in the terms of reference of ACAS which laid upon the Service the obligation of encouraging the extension of collective bargaining, and it could be reasonably argued that here was an extension of collective bargaining, namely, the recognition of a trade union to represent a particular group or description of people in that establishment.<br><br>
However, the employer had already said that to do that would add yet another trade union in a situation where there were perhaps already too many trade unions. It would add a trade union for a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 222</span>
group for which, in the employer's view, there was already adequate representation by other trade unions. I think that the other trade unions were the trade union of my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo), ASTMS, and the draughtsmen's section of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers, known as TASS.<br><br>
In that case, the Service said "Our terms of reference also require us to have regard to the promotion or improvement of industrial relations, and notwithstanding our other obligation, we consider that to allow the request would be harmful to industrial relations in this establishment—and made a recommendation accordingly in its subsequent report.<br><br>
That was challenged in the courts by the United Kingdom Association of Professional Engineers. Mr. Justice May then ruled, in looking at the two limbs of the terms of reference of ACAS, that the general duty of promoting the improvement of industrial relations must be subordinated to the particular duty of encouraging the extension of collective bargaining. He accordingly ruled in favour of the United Kingdom Association of Professional Engineers and said that the employer ought to grant recognition for bargaining purposes. At this stage, or even earlier, not only the employer, not only the trade unions which already enjoyed recognition by that employer, but also the Engineering Employers' Federation pointed out that to do so would be harmful to industrial relations.<br><br>
I mention that only to illustrate that we have recognised one of the areas of difficulty that have arisen. I perhaps ought to add that it is yet another case which was referred to the Court of Appeal, the Master of the Rolls presiding, which upheld Mr. Justice May. The matter has been before their Lordships on appeal. I understand that they have heard the appeal but the Judgment is still awaited. So I must be rather cautious, as I understand it, in moving further on that. As I say, I mention it only to illustrate that we have seen one of the difficulties and have reflected our recognition of that difficulty in the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intervene merely to remind the right hon. Gentleman that it was just as the Conservative Opposition on the Standing Committee on which we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0622">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 223</span>
both sat foretold—that difficulty would arise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I recall correctly, when we discussed these matters in 1975 the hon. and learned Gentleman and his colleagues felt it right, notwithstanding their reservations about the form of words, that the Government should encourage the extension of collective bargaining and that it should do so through the proper recognition of the appropriate and relevant trade unions in their relationships with their employers. It would be interesting to hear—this is one thing which we hope will emerge from our discussion on the amendment—the Government's views on the extension of collective bargaining, the recognition of trade unions—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend agree that extending collective bargaining does not necessarily mean the same as increasing the number of trade unions with bargaining rights? The extension applies to the number of people covered by bargaining rather than to the number of individual trade unions involved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is quite right but, if he will forgive me for saying so, I think that that oversimplifies the situation. I have repeatedly said, both as a Minister and in opposition, that we have too many trade unions in our industrial relations system, but that does not mean that we have too many trade unionists. If anything, the contrary is true. But there are many areas where there are difficulties in developing collective bargaining and enabling work people to have an adequate way of seeking to maintain and improve their terms and conditions of employment because employers, either because they are hostile to trade unions or for other reasons, refuse to recognise a particular trade union. Indeed, we have touched once or twice on a particular situation that was notorious for an employer's refusal properly to recognise a trade union. I shall not go into that.<br><br>
With the withdrawal of the recognition provisions of the Employment Protection Act 1975, the Secretary of State may well come under pressure, in the light of what I fear may be difficulties that will arise, for the production of a code of practice which will lay down guidelines about how
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 224</span>
recognition might be sought and obtained and the way in which that should be decided, setting down, as it were, were some Queensberry rules. I think that, in anticipation of that likelihood, we are entitled to have some ideas from the Government about how they see those guidelines emerging and whether they would be prepared to provide them.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
Perhaps I have said sufficient at this stage to make clear the purpose of the amendment. We do not accept the purposes of the clause in its entirety or even the principle that the Secretary of State should be empowered to issue codes of practice, but we recognise that, notwithstanding our reservations, it may subsequently be incorporated in the Bill as a statutory power that the Secretary of State shall have. Do the Government envisage producing a code on recognition, in the light of the repeal of sections 11 to 16 of the 1975 Act, laying down some guidelines? Finally, will the Government give some indication of the way in which their thoughts are running on this matter, since neither on Second Reading nor in Committee have we had any indication about this? I look forward with interest to what the Under-Secretary has to say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to what the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) had to say about the proceedings on the Employment Protection Bill in 1975. He has drawn our attention to the wording of the general duties imposed upon ACAS in section 1 of that Act, which provides:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Service shall be charged with the general duty of promoting the improvement of industrial relations, and in particular of encouraging the extension of collective bargaining."</p></blockquote>
My mind goes back to those many weeks when we pointed out repeatedly that there was bound to be a conflict. I recall that our fears were dismissed by those speaking for the then Government, including the right hon. Gentleman, as being quite fanciful, saying that there was no conflict. Now, rather to my surprise, I hear the right hon. Gentleman announce that there was a conflict and that it had become apparent over the years that difficulties, in particular in relation to the recognition procedures in sections 11 to 16, had emerged. We know that that is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0623">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 225</span>
absolutely right, but I admired the blandness with which that part of the right hon. Gentleman's speech was delivered, because there was not one word of recognition that these difficulties had been foretold at the time.<br><br>
I suggest that, if we are to go back to the 1975 Act, rather more value is to be gained by referring not to section 1 which imposed the general duties but to section 6 which deals with the power of ACAS there conferred to issue codes of practice. Subsection (1) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Service may issue Codes of Practice containing such practical guidance as the Service thinks fit for the purpose of promoting the improvement of industrial relations."</p></blockquote>
One does not, for one, have to be a lawyer of the distinction of the hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson), whom I am glad to see with us today, to realise that the wording in section 6(1) is identically reproduced in the present clause. Why was it that the previous Government, when giving power to ACAS to issue a code of practice, did not see fit to add the words now sought to be added by the amendment? It is all the more significant, in the light of the general duty of which the right hon. Gentleman has reminded us today, that they did not.<br><br>
I advise my hon. Friends to resist the amendment not because the Government are against collective bargaining—that would be very silly in the modern industrial world—but because we are against collective bargaining being regarded as synonymous with the improvement of industrial relations. In many instances collective bargaining is appropriate, but in very few can it be seen to be rightly imposed. We believe that collective bargaining has far and away the best chance of success when it is freely and voluntarily bargained for and agreed upon.<br><br>
For that reason, it would be a great mistake to accept the amendment. It would have the effect of limiting the ability of the Secretary of State to introduce any code of practice, because such code of practice would have to be for the purpose of extending collective bargaining as well as for that of promoting the improvement of industrial relations. We think that that would be wrong.<br><br>
I shall try to deal briefly with some of the questions that the right hon. Gentleman has asked me. I have dealt with what he described as the dichotomy—but I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 226</span>
think that he meant the conflict—between these two general duties. He asked how the Government see the guidelines emerging.<br><br>
We have more than once said publicly that we expect the Secretary of State to issue codes of practice relating to picketing and to the closed shop. As for picketing, my right hon. Friend has said more than once that it is to be hoped that voluntary guidelines can be agreed. I thought that the guidelines produced by the TUC as the annex to its concordat document in February last year marked a significant advance. They do not go far enough and we cannot accept them at the moment, for obvious reasons—not least because they provide for picketing at places more distant that one's own place of work—but if it were possible for a code of practice or a voluntary code to be arrived at that met what the Government regard as the necessary criteria, the Government would be delighted.<br><br>
But in the absence of that, though we hope that it will prove to be possible, my right hon. Friend would envisage, after consultation with ACAS, which the clause makes obligatory, drafting and producing a code of practice on picketing, which would then be subject to representations. As provided in the clause, representations would then be made, and my right hon. Friend would be able to amend the draft and present it to Parliament for approval.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I follow the hon. and learned Gentleman aright, he has just said that the document produced with the concordat was not satisfactory but that if the TUC could come up with something on a voluntary basis, the Government might find it acceptable. In that case, I do not understand why the Government are not and have not been talking to the TUC on precisely those lines, instead of coming forward with this legislation. They have made no attempt to produce what in their eyes is a more satisfactory voluntary arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is, for once, misinformed. We have had three separate meetings with the employment policy and organisation committee of the TUC. I think that I am right in saying that on all of those occasions—certainly on two of them—our proposals for picketing have been discussed, and it has been made clear that the Government would wel-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0624">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 227</span>
come an extension of the guidelines which would meet what they regard as the necessary criteria. The hon. Gentleman is wrong on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong, but those discussions were held in the context of this legislation being brought forward. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that an offer was made that, if the TUC came forward with appropriate voluntary guidelines, the Government would drop the legislation in this area? That is certainly not my understanding of the position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. It has been made clear from the earliest consultative paper issued in July that the Government propose to take powers—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—to take powers. However, it has been made equally clear, as I have just indicated, that the Government much prefer to proceed by way of agreement, by way of consensus. We hope that that will be possible, we think it right to take these powers in case, unhappily, it should not be possible. That is the beginning and the end of it.<br><br>
On the closed shop, again the proposal is to issue a code of practice setting out what we believe to be the right practice for the institution of a closed shop and a proper practice for its operation. That is the extent to which the Government envisage making use of the power which the clause provides.<br><br>
I was asked whether the Government see themselves producing a code on recognition. It follows from what I have said that there is no present intention to issue a code on recognition.<br><br>
I believe that I have answered the questions that I have been asked. I have tried shortly to indicate the Government's approach, and I must advise my hon. Friends to resist the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman says that he has replied to the points made. I must have been hearing a different speech. He has dealt with codes on picketing and the closed shop, to neither of which I referred, but he has not said a word about how the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 228</span>
Government see collective bargaining developing. When he says that they have in the Bill reproduced the words embodied in section 6 of the 1975 Act, he knows that the 1975 Act, as I have said more than once, laid down the statutory procedure by means of which a trade union could seek recognition. The Government are sweeping that away, and that was the whole point of the amendment and the thrust of my argument.<br><br>
There would have been no need for the amendment had not the Government been repealing the relevant provisions of the 1975 Act, leaving a lacuna which we are seeking not to fill but to give an opportunity of filling. All that we are suggesting is that the Secretary of State should have the power. I am not sure whether I should want the present Government to use it, but in the absence of any statutory means of encouraging and facilitating a union to obtain recognition from an employer, I might want some subsequent Secretary of State in a Labour Government to have such a power re-enacted.<br><br>
We are entitled to hear from the Government how they see this particularly controversial areas of industrial relations—as it has proved to be in recent years—dealt with in a civilised, sensible fashion rather than having it fought out on the stones in Willesden with blood on the pavement.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman tells us about what the Government propose to do to regulate the trade union side in the conduct of industrial relations, but when we suggest to him that he or his right hon. Friend might be contemplating something which had some regulating influence on the employers, we have silence. By and large, we are talking about the employers' attitude—about Grunwick and ConMec and all the other situations where we have had pitched battles and intense emotion, and people have been denied rights.<br><br>
I have said repeatedly that I accept that there were defects in what we provided in 1975. It would have been remarkable if we had got everything in that long Act right, particularly when it entered so many hitherto uncharted fields. In the light of experience we ought to try to improve it, to plug the holes in it, to remedy its weaknesses and defects, not just sweep them aside, but when we ask the Government what they propose to put in its place they talk about picketing and closed shops.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0625">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 229</span>
They say nothing about what should happen if an employer refuses workers the right for their union representatives to enter into discussions and negotiations with him. Consequently there is a steady development of the kind of situation that we have seen. The Government are silent. The hon. and learned Gentleman has let the Committee down this morning. We are entitled to hear a lot more from him.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cyril Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I follow the point which the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) is making. I see great merit in the way he is pushing the Government. I had considerable sympathy with the amendment until the Minister replied, and I interject rather than make a speech so that the Opposition Front Bench may consider my query and perhaps answer it later in the debate.<br><br>
The only merit in the Minister's argument is that if the amendment is carried the only codes of practice on good industrial relations will be those that contain reference to methods of bargaining. I agree entirely with the right hon. Gentleman's example of Grunwick. The Opposition will agree that in such cases it will be necessary to include something about the method of collective bargaining. There are other instances—for example, worker participation in industry, about which the Front Bench had much to say in the debate on the Industry Bill on the Floor of the House yesterday. It may not be necessary in such a code of practice to cover collective bargaining, but apparently the amendment would prevent a code of practice being issued in that respect. I wonder whether during the debate the Opposition Front Bench could think about that. It seems to be a drafting difficulty rather than a matter of principle. I hope that the Opposition will press the Government further along those lines.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) that it is not intended that the amendment should have the effect that he thinks it will have. I doubt whether it will have that effect. I assume that both the hon. Gentleman and the Committee have gathered what our intention is from my remarks. We are not saying that this is the only area where the Secretary of State should have this power.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 230</span>
I hope that I have made it clear that we do not accepting the principle embodied in the clause—that a Conservative Secretary of State should have this power. We have strong reservations about it. What I am saying is that if we are to have this provision in statute the Government should have power so that if they are pressurised by another Grunwick-type event to set out clear guidelines to employers on how they should conduct themselves, the Secretary of State cannot say "I do not have the power to do it". Frankly, I should prefer to give the power to ACAS but under the Bill the Secretary of State will have power to override any code produced by ACAS. Equally I can understand ACAS's difficulties. I also understand why some of my hon. Friends share the reservations that ACAS has about getting over-involved in this difficulty. I am advancing an argument that is essentially personal in the light of my experience as a Minister.<br><br>
I stress again that this is obviously one of the most difficult and sensitive controversial areas of industural relations. It is wrong for any body involved in industrial relations to say that we should leave the issue to be fought out by the forces of industry, resolved by <i>force majeure;</i> and That we should not attempt to introduce any scheme, system or machinery. Our responsibility is to do is to face facts. Notwithstanding what has been said about the 1975 Act I was not challenged when I said that successive Governments had shared the view that our system of industrial relations is based on the concepts or collective bargaining conducted through strong trade unions. If we believe that, we must also believe that strong trade unions should be encouraged and recognised by employers and that there should be some way of telling employers how they should respond when a trade union seeks recognition, and some machinery by which a trade union can discuss its claim for recognition with a Member of Parliament. We have heard nothing about that from the Government this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should not like it to be thought that I have not assisted the Committee to the best of my ability. I remind the Committee of what my right hon. Friend said on Second Reading. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I should say that I am not wholly unsympathetic to the idea of some statutory recognition provision. I appreciate the problems for smaller unions, include-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0626">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 231</span>
ing the EMA—there are other unions even smaller—but I feel, on balance, that such was the damage to ACAS that it would be better to proceed as we propose. The voluntary services of ACAS in recognition cases will still be available, and I intend to discuss with ACAS the scope of its issuing guidance to employers and unions to help on recognition issues. [<i>Official Report,</i> 17 December 1979; Vol. 976, c. 69</p></blockquote>
My right hon. Friend was making the point that notwithstanding the proposed repeal of sections 11 to 16 on the jurisdiction of ACAS, ACAS should still have the ability to give help and guidance to those who are engaged in a recognition dispute through its general duties contained in section 2 of the Act. He was saying that he certainly saw value in that. It is important to remember that that power will continue to be exercised by ACAS. The Government believe that ACAS will be able to exercise that power much more effectively once sections 11 to 16 have gone. That is my reply in response to the right hon. Gentleman's question about how the Government envisage future guidance to employers and trade unions engaged in recognition disputes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I share the view of the hon. and learned Gentleman and the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) about the interpretation of the amendment. There can be little doubt that its effect will be to prevent the use of a code of practice which does not encourage collective bargaining. I shall leave aside all the existing problems of resolving particular cases where there is conflict between encouraging collective bargaining and promoting industrial relations. Looking at the present and the future rather than the past, what type of code of practice—the object of which is to improve industrial relations—can be issued without involving collective bargaining. The alternative to collective bargaining is individual bargaining. There is no half-way position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no bargaining at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or no bargaining. If one bargains at all, one must talk to one's employees, groups of employees, or persons whom they have chosen to represent them, or one must talk to them one at a time. I would like to know the circumstances in which industrial relations are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 232</span>
improved by an employer talking to his employees—on no matter what subject—one at a time rather than collectively. The hon. Member for Rochdale is very keen—and I share his keenness—to extend democracy to the workplace to the greatest possible extent and in the most practical way.<br><br>
Let us suppose that a code of practice is issued for that purpose. I am sure that the hon. Member for Rochdale will agree that the way to extend industrial democracy is by dealing with representatives. Workers may belong to a trade union. They may not have a trade union, but establish some other representative organisation for themselves such as a staff association. I prefer workers to belong to trade unions but let us suppose that they do not. Is it thought possible to institute a system of industrial democracy in a factory of 300 people by going the rounds and having 300 separate conversations? There must be some sort of collective arrangement because the bargaining and reaching agreement is dependent on it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Needham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I try to help the hon. Gentleman? There are many occasions when it is vital to talk to each person individually. People at work have to discuss privately with their bosses issues which are not appropriate for collective agreement or through representatives. For example, there may be criticisms about the work practices of the representative and the man concerned. Surely, the whole basis of having a code of practice on participation is that it is beyond and above collective bargaining. I am much in favour of a code of practice on participation. But it would be unwise to limit it by inserting the phrase in the amendment. Industrial democracy or worker participation, by definition, must go further than collective bargaining has now gone.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like to take a poll of practical managers to see how many of them support that view and how many support my view. I wonder how many of them would think that the right way to arrange industrial democracy is to have separate conversations with every one of their employees. I do not know any management that behaves in that way anywhere but in the smallest workplaces.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary said, as has often been said by spokesmen of his party and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0627">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 233</span>
representatives of his Government, that he much prefers things to be done voluntarily by agreement than by statutory compulsion. That is absolutely right. We all feel that way. But he says that we must have these reserve powers in case the voluntary method does not work. Fallback powers may help to ensure that the voluntary method does not work because they will be greatly resented. Nobody likes to be put into a position where somebody comes to him and says, "Now, look, old chap, let's sit and have a talk about this sensibly and see if we can reach agreement. If we don't, I have a whacking great club and I will clobber you over the head with it." That is no incentive to a person, other than a craven person, to discuss and seek to reach voluntary agreement.<br><br>
If one follows the clause right through and goes through stage by stage to the way in which the code of practice is encapsulated into an order and finally to subsection (8) under which failure on the part of any person to observe this code can lead to a-appearance before a court or a tribunal, one is reminded of the Penton-ville Five. Although the subsection provides that such a failure
<br><blockquote><p>"shall not in itself render him liable to any proceedings"</p></blockquote>
what is really being said here—I take the example of picketing, to which my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) referred—is that under a code of practice on picketing we can sack a bloke because he has been on a picket line and he has no redress before an industrial tribunal; it would not be considered an unfair dismissal.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
A Pentonville Five situation is being created in which a man is punished—and very severely punished—for his convictions. It does not matter whether he is punished by being put in Pentonville or is punished by being put out of a job. It is much worse to be put out of a job than to spend two or three days in Pentonville. I gather that those five dockers had quite a nice time there. He is punished for his convictions, and that is not conducive to the sweetness of industrial relations by a long chalk.<br><br>
If the hon. and learned Gentlman aims at resolving these matters by sensible voluntary arrangements, he will have a much better chance of doing so without the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 234</span>
heavy bludgeon that the clause places in the hands of people who are ranged against what workers believe to be in their interests. If he really wants to sweeten industrial relations, he ought not to proceed with the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I found the Under-Secretary's remarks slightly disappointing. We are dealing with codes to improve industrial relations, and I should have thought that in order to do that we should encourage collective bargaining. The wording here would not enforce collective bargaining. The word used in the amendment is "extending". I hoped that the Government would accept the amendment, believing it to be a good thing to extend collective bargaining.<br><br>
Is it the Governments' view that extending collective bargaining is in itself a good thing? In my view it is. Many trade unionists who voted Conservative at the last election were given the impression that the Government believed in collective bargaining and, in fact, would insert the word "free" before "collective bargaining"—that is, collective bargaining unencumbered by any sort of incomes policy. Enlightened opinion has always held that collective bargaining was natural and inevitable in modern society. I can understand that in a pre-industrial society with cottage industries it would not be something to be encouraged. But in factories with production lines, if a person has a grievance it becomes a common grievance. Fred's grievance is the same as Charlie's. Inevitably, they all get together and say to someone "Go and explain to the manager that we are unhappy about this." Some sort of shop steward or representative is, at it were, thrown up, and inevitably and naturally collective bargaining emerges.<br><br>
If we are to have effective industrial relations, we should promote and encourage collective bargaining. Let us take the nearest thing we have to cottage industry. Farmers, for example, are very independent-minded but they usually see the advantage of coming together co-operatively and in the National Farmers Union.<br><br>
The whole purpose of a union is to bargain collectively. I am assuming that hon. Members on the Government Benches want to encourage as many people as possible to join a trade union. An hon. Member shakes his head. I thought that it was the general policy of the Con-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0628">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 235</span>
servative Party to encourage trade union membership. The present Secretary of State, who, I thought, was the mentor of our colleagues opposite, said in the debate on 23 June 1975:
<br><blockquote><p>"I am encouraging every Tory not only to belong to a union but to play a part in the union."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 23 June 1975; Vol 894, c. 378]</p></blockquote>
So the Secretary of State wants every member of the Conservative party to join a union. The function of a union is to bargain collectively. There may be the odd maverick who takes a different view but, as I understand it, the policy of the Tory Party is to encourage Tories to join trade unions. I hope that this would apply not only to Tories. I hope that they would encourage Liberals to join trade unions and to play an active part. That, surely, means to join in collective bargaining. I am disappointed by the Under-Secretary's view and, if I have misunderstood it, I shall be grateful for an explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cyril Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My contribution will be brief. It has been largely prompted by the debate so far. When I entered the room this morning, I had no intention of speaking on the amendment or on the clause.<br><br>
I cannot go along with the amendment as drafted, but I appeal to the Minister to look at the possibility of introducing some slight amendment on Report to satisfy the official Opposition on this point in some way. If he is not able to satisfy them, perhaps he could at least prove to them that he is not out of sympathy with the substance of their argument, if not necessarily with the intention behind the amendment.<br><br>
I cannot support an amendment which says that the only codes of practice that can be issued are those which contain some reference to collective bargaining. I can see the necessity—indeed, the desirability—of introducing some codes of practice that have no reference to collective bargaining. For example, to use the oft-quoted illustration of picketing, it may well be that one can issue a code of practice on picketing which has not the slightest reference to collective bargaining: how many pickets there shall be, whether they shall wear armbands, whether they shall be able to picket this place or that, and so on—full-stop. That would have nothing to do with collective bargaining as such.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 236</span>
As I understand it, if the amendment were carried it would prevent that type of code of practice or conduct being issued because it would contain no reference to collective bargaining.<br><br>
On the other hand, one is anxious to encourage collective bargaining and to encourage voluntary membership of trade unions. If I make any contribution to the Committee proceedings in any depth, I hope that it will be when we come to the closed shop, when I shall argue strongly for voluntary membership of trade unions as opposed to compulsory membership. Indeed, I had intended to remain fairly quiet in the Committee until we reach that point.<br><br>
I ask the Government to have another look at the pleas being made, not necessarily in the terms of the amendment but rather in the spirit of the speeches made this morning. I suspect that the real purpose behind the amendment is to wreck the possibility of codes of conduct or codes of practice being issued at all. But that is not the spirit of the speeches made this morning, and I hope that, in the spirit of those speeches—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment had no such sinister design or intention. It was put forward in the spirit in which I moved it. If the hon. and learned Gentleman were to say that he recognised what we sought but we had got the drafting wrong, that would be consistent with normal Committee practice. Let me stress again that what we hoped for most of all was some clearer indication of the Government's attitude towards and support for collective bargaining and its extension, how they saw it developing and how they imagined killing it in the light of the repeal of sections 11 to 16 of the Employment Protection Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that interjection. Knowing the right hon. Gentleman as I do—we have known one another for nearly 30 years—I know him to be an honest man. His interjection strengthens my appeal to the Government to have another look at this issue before Report.<br><br>
I have a little reservation—not sufficient to make me vote against the clause—about resolutions put before the House—full-stop—because what "resolution" means is the will of the Cabinet or the Minister which the House has either to accept or reject. As we all know in this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0629">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 237</span>
place, it means "accept" because governments usually have majorities. It is the Government who are proposing the code and therefore the code goes through. My criticism is that Back-Bench Members have no opportunity to amend a code of practice. The procedure of the House does not allow us to do that.<br><br>
If the Government were to say that they would ask the Procedure Committee or some such body to look at the possibility of amendments being tabled so that even codes of practice—which become extremely important under this Bill because they now become legally admissible in a court of law as evidence—might be amended, I should be even happier than I am. I shall support the clause, but I appeal to the Government to try to meet the official Opposition in some way, perhaps on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would it not be a good idea—presumably, the Government party while in opposition for four years gave a lot of thought to this—for us to see these codes now in the Committee so that we could discuss them? Would that not be far better than that most unsatisfactory procedure to which the hon. Member has just referred?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be desirable, if such codes existed but, in fairness to the Government, they might reasonably say, recognising the implication that they are likely to be in power for four years, that they do not know in 1980 what codes they will issue in 1982. Therefore, I do not think that anyone could press them to produce now codes which they propose to issue in future. But it would be of considerable help to Back-Bench Members if the Government were to say that before any codes of practice were issued under this clause they would be prepared, for example, to issue some sort of consultative paper for Members to express an opinion on before the actual code was put before the House. I can find that one can often influence a Government if one can get to them before the thing becomes virtually a fait accompli and is in print. That would be a considerable step forward, though I recognise, in fairness to the Under-Secretary, that we are talking about the procedure of the House rather than the enactment of the Bill itself. But any assurance from the Government that Back-Bench Members will have an oppor-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 238</span>
tunity to comment on codes of practice before they became codes of practice or before the House is asked to vote on them will be a considerable step forward.</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) that it is difficult to see how any code of practice for improving industrial relations could do so on a basis other than that of collective bargaining, I am not with him in agreeing with the Under-Secretary's interpretation of the amendment and its effect. He says that the Government cannot accept it because it would mean that each code of practice would be required to promote the improvement of industrial relations and extend collective bargaining.<br><br>
I see no reason why the clause as amended should be interpreted in that way. The word "each" does not occur anywhere. There is nothing to say that we must look at each code of practice individually and apply these two tests to it. Is it not equally valid to interpret it as meaning that the codes of practice—in the plural, and it is expressed in the plural—taken as a package must meet those two points—that in total they must promote the improvement of industrial relations and extend collective bargaining? If we had intended the amendment to apply to each individual code of practice, we could have phrased it differently.<br><br>
I do not wish to attribute sinister motives to the Under-Secretary in rejecting the amendment but I am a little suspicious because I frequently hear Conservative spokesmen saying what a good thing trade unionism is and how they would like to see people join trade unions on a voluntary basis, of course, but when the opportunity arises to do something about trade unionism in this clause they reject it. I should like to know what is behind the rejection, as I do not accept the Minister's interpretation of the restriction that the clause would place on the Secretary of State if the amendment were accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not delay the Committee long but this is an important amendment. In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther), may I say that I suspect that the reason the Government are rejecting
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0630">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 239</span>
the amendment is that they have not the faintest idea how to write any sort of codes of practice on improving collective bargaining. I suspect that they have no idea how to write any code on improving industrial relations. I have a feeling that everyone in the Department of Employment is keeping his head down on this subject and will leave it to the Secretary of State, after he has fought his Cabinet battles, to arrive at the codes of practice he will produce.<br><br>
The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) to the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) is important. In the context of my hon. Friend's intervention, I think it worth while to look again at what the Secretary of State said on Tuesday in our short debate on the motion to adjourn. I rather suspect that, rather than the Bill itself, it was the assembled press and the fact that the Committee was being recorded for broadcast which triggered off the outburst from the Secretary of State. It is in this context that our amendment is of significance:
<br><blockquote><p>"I believe, and have always believed, that if we can get agreement between the parties to sensible changes in the law, that will be the greatest step forward that this country could ever take in industrial relations. That is what I have sought to do."</p></blockquote>
He went on to quote from <i>The Economist</i> and then, before I tried to intervene, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I believe that we have an absolute duty to our country to try to reach the maximum amount of agreement between the two sides of the House but not to refrain from doing what we know to be right."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 5 February 1980; c. 177.]</p></blockquote>
It is in this context that one suspects that the Department of Employment and the Under-Secretary have some difficulty. Some of us on this side have ideas and knowledge of free collective bargaining. We also know the difference between improving industrial relations in that broad sense and free collective bargaining. Indeed, there is a powerful school of thought in the trade union movement that if there is extensive free collective bargaining in any plant or establishment, there will almost certainly be reasonable industrial relations, but where there are restrictions on free collective bargaining there cannot be good industrial relations.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary should think
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 240</span>
again. As my right hon. Friend said earlier, what we want is a commitment from the Government that they accept the spirit of free collective bargaining. The Under-Secretary made heavy weather of the argument that if the amendment were accepted it would mean that no code of practice could be produced simply on industrial relations but all would have to include free collective bargaining. Frankly, those were the words more of a barrister than of anyone who has ever worked on the shop floor or has any knowledge of shop-floor thinking.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman should think again. He should recognise that we would try to meet the Secretary of State in his wish for agreement on creating good industrial relations. Wherever and whenever politicians and lawyers get their fingers into industrial relations, he will invariably find—he can go back as far as he likes—at the end of the day the position is a lot worse than at the beginning. I suspect that the net outcome of the Bill will be that industrial relations will be gravely impaired.<br><br>
I made the point at our last sitting that there are far more industrial issues and disputes than the present steelworkers' strike. Hon. Members tend to concentrate on the steelworkers' strike. It is worth bearing in mind that here is an industry and a trade union which have had 50 years of industrial peace, yet when the workers strike nationally and become involved in a dispute with their employers we see all the practices about which the Tory Party has been screaming its head off for the last few years used by men who have a marvellous record of industrial relations. That shows the bitterness which creeps in when an industrial dispute gets under way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend agree that the 50 years of industrial peace in the steel industry to which he has very properly referred is largely due to the fact that there has been an extremely high degree of trade union organisation in that industry throughout those years?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. That point is worthy of some thought by hon. Members opposite. The tradition of strong trade unionism with strong control from the centre, coupled with good relations on the shop floor, has meant a long period of stability in that industry. Yet everyone must recognise
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0631">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 241</span>
that the stability of the industry has now been smashed completely. Bitterness and personal hatreds have crept in, and it will be a long time before industrial relations in that industry are back to what they were before the strike started. It is a classic example of the problems that can be created when men feel that they are involved in a strike in which not only their employers but the combined employers and Government are against them. They have shown their strength and solidarity in this context, and it is a lesson that the Tory Party would do well to consider seriously.<br><br>
I return to the narrow point of the amendment. I urge in the strongest possible terms that the Under-Secretary should give consideration to what the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) said, that he should think about it again. It may well not be accurately drafted. We accept that; it is always a problem in opposition. We ask the Minister and the Tory Party to show their good faith when they are seeking to obtain agreement among all sides in the House. Let them recognise the strength of the spirit of our amendment. We want to see a commitment to free collective bargaining. I suspect that over the next two or three years, if the Bill goes on to the statute book, we shall have codes of practice emanating from the Department. They will probably not be worth the paper they are written on, but I suspect that the idea will be that the more codes of practice are churned out, the more industrial relations will be improved. The only snag is that when the men go on the picket line at 6 o'clock in the morning, instead of reading the codes of practice they tend to do other things with them—not very polite things.<br><br>
I therefore strongly urge the Under-Secretary to think again and say that he accepts the spirit in which the Opposition have put this proposal forward. If we want to improve industrial relations we must make clear to the trade union movement that we accept the spirit of free collective bargaining. Let the Government accept this amendment, subject to drafting. If the Under-Secretary wants to come back on Report with a different form of words, we shall go along with it. My right hon. Friend will probably be willing to withdraw the amendment, but at this stage, unless the Under-Secretary can come up with a better explanation than he gave us at first, I hope that he will press it.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 242</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Everyone else on the Opposition side seems to have spoken on, and since mu return to the Committee was welcomed in such flattering terms by the Under-Secertary I thought I ought to signal that return with a modest contribution.<br><br>
I hope that the Hon. and learned Gentleman, for whom I have the greatest respect, who is knowledgeable on these matters and who has a good judgment of Committees, is not saying that the only reason for rejecting this very reasonable amendment is because that on his legal interpretation, he would be unable to issue a code of practice concerned with promoting improvement of industrial relations without also issuing a code of practice extending collective bargaining.<br><br>
If that is the hon. and learned Gentleman's reason, it may be a sound legalistic reading of the amendment but it is not a reason that would appeal to, or be understood by, trade unionists. One of the dangers of falling back on legalistic interpretation as the hon. and learned Gentleman well knows, is that though lawyers understand the legal arguments that can well tear a clause apart, those reasons are often not understood by the people actually concerned with having to carry out the code. If the hon. and learned Gentleman's reason is as I have stated it he should have in mind what he wants to achieve by the code of practice—which is self-evident, according to him, in the Bill itself—the improvement of industrial relations. In what way would the amendment, presented with great force by my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker), not help the improvement of industrial relations?<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
My hon. Friends have spoken about how valuable collective bargaining is. If the hon. and learned Gentleman is saying that he agrees with those arguments but that on narrow legal grounds the Secretary of State would be in some difficulty, it is not beyond his considerable legal skill to brush up the amendment in some way to meet that narrow objection. Of course, he can.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) knows a lot about these matters and I compliment him, although I may not always agree with him. He regards the spirit of the amendment as admirable. If the hon. and learned Gentleman also
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0632">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 243</span>
regards the spirit of the amendment as having merit, why does he not say that there is that narrow legal objection which might put the Secretary of State in some difficulties—he might be restricted, he might not be able to issue a particular code of practice because of the wording—but it is not beyond his power to accept the spirit of the amendment and to bring forward himself an amendment which will match that spirit. In that way, in my view, he would be able to implement everything that my right hon. and hon. Friends want to do by this modest and well-intentioned amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting and valuable debate. Naturally, my right hon. Friend and I will consider carefully all that has been said. I think that we all agree on both sides of the House in the Committee that there is a valuable place in legislation today for codes of practice, certainly in industrial relations legislation. The hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) said that he did not believe that the Government had the slightest idea how to set about writing a code of practice. It is fair to remind him that the first code of practice in this field of law, which was introduced under the Industrial Relations Act 1971, is still in part in force and was kept in force by the last Labour Government. I refer to the code of practice on industrial relations. So I do not think we can be said to have done too badly in that regard.<br><br>
That is the starting point. There is a place for codes of practice. One can give guidance—one can give a nudge—setting out what, in the Government's view, is the right direction, without being trammelled by the rigidity that always goes with the wording of main legislation. That is an important thing.<br><br>
However, one has to be careful how one expresses the powers. I believe that we are entitled to draw some support from the way in which the Labour Government drew the powers for ACAS to introduce codes of practice. They were very wide, and they were indentical with the wording which the Government propose in the clause. Notwithstanding the general duty imposed upon ACAS to extend collective bargaining, when they came to section 6 empowering ACAS to issue codes of practice of its own, the Government of the day went very much at large and restricted it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 244</span>
to the promotion of good industrial relations. That was sensible, because one always runs into difficulties when one adds further words whether by example or by a new category. One runs into the old business of. "If they have included that they must have intended to exclude the other."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must stress again the point which I made earlier. Where as the present Government are removing the statutory procedures by means of which a trade union may seek recognition, we introduced them at the same time as we made the provisions of the 1975 Act to which the hon. and learned Gentleman refers. Many of my remarks and those of my hon. Friends have been directed to the issue of recognition. We shall inevitably return to the issue when we reach the appropriate part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the right hon. Gentleman says, and these are matters to be fully explored when we come to that part of the Bill. But when hon. and right hon. Gentlemen ask for a commitment from the Government to the extension of free collective bargaining, let them remember this. Although the Government are making certain amendments to the 1975 Act and are, for example, proposing to remove sections 11 to 16, they are not proposing to amend the general duties imposed upon ACAS.<br><br>
Similarly, there is the commitment given by my right hon. Friend on Second Reading, to which I have already referred, that there is something to be said for some statutory recognition provision, and he went on to refer to the voluntary services of ACAS. The important thing here is that under its general duties ACAS is vested—these are the controversial words—with the duty to extend collective bargaining. Recognition issues are still to be within the jurisdiction of ACAS after sections 11 to 16 have gone. Its general advisory duties will extend, if necessary, to issuing a code of practice upon recognition matters, and certainly to advising parties in dispute. It seems to us to be essentially a matter that can be left under ACAS's general duties, and it certainly does not call for the insertion of the words which the amendment proposes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has pointed out that it does
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0633">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 245</span>
not make too much difference to the 1975 Act in relation to ACAS, but will he accept the genuine fear on our side that we shall not always have such an enlightened Minister as the present Secretary of State, or even the hon. and learned Gentleman himself? Is he aware, for instance, that people such as the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst), and the wing of the Conservative Party which he supports are appalled at the fact that the Bill does not amend the provisions relating to ACAS? This is why we are asking, when we know we have an enlightened Secretary of State in the Department, for acceptance of the commitment to extend free collective bargaining and for something put into the Bill to bind the hands of a possible Right-wing hard-line successor to the present Secretary of State for Employment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Conservative Party is nothing if not a catholic party, which makes it the strong national party that it is. The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. He cannot seek to have something put into the clause which will bind successive governments and at the same time avoid the criticism which I am afraid is inevitable on the present wording that any code of practice must be for the purpose of extending free collective bargaining.<br><br>
I wish to make perfectly clear that the Government see great advantage in collective bargaining and set great store by it. I also see the wisdom of some words of the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) in moving the amendment, when he said that in this country we have not too many trade unionists but too many trade unions. We all know the wisdom of that. But it is one thing to acknowledge the virtue of collective bargaining and another to write into a clause whose purpose is to give a general power to the Secretary of State to issue his own codes of practice, in parallel with the power that ACAS will continue to have, a provision that requires those codes of practice to be for the advancement or extension of collective bargaining.<br><br>
I accept at once that it is not the intention to make it obligatory for every code of practice to be for the purpose of extending collective bargaining, but that that is the effect of the amendment.<br><br>
Even if the wording were corrected, that would not enable the Government to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 246</span>
accept the proposed amendment. We see considerable difficulty in accepting some reference to collective bargaining when the purpose is solely to empower the Secretary of State to issue a code for the purpose of promoting good industrial relations. If the Secretary of State is so advised; if he thinks that for the purpose of promoting good industrial relations there should be guidance on collective bargaining or on recognition, he is empowered under this clause to make such a code of practice and to head it "A code of practice on recognition or collective bargaining". He is perfectly entitled to do that under the wording of the clause as drafted. The previous Government were wise to draft their clause 6 of the 1975 Act in the precise words which we have adopted for this clause.<br><br>
By taking this line, I am in no way seeking to impugn the validity or value of collective bargaining. But it would be wrong to accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In no way do I wish to detract from what my hon. and learned Friend has said about the value of collective bargaining. Despite what any hon. Member may have thought about my views, I ask my hon. and learned Friend to make it clear that his remarks do not carry any imputation that there is anything necessarily wrong or undesirable about individual bargaining with employers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I gladly give that assurance. It brings out what is central to the approach of the Government and the Conservative Party to these matters—that bargaining arrangements should be left to those who are affected by them. If one constructs a template and seeks by statute to force people's arrangements into conformity with it, one gets things badly wrong. I should have thought that this would have found favour with Labour members who are always seeking to impress upon us the infinite variety of individual industrial circumstances. I entirely agree with my hon. Friend.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) said that codes make it harder to achieve voluntary agreement. He said that we should not use a bludgeon. But I think that he was alone on that side of the Committee in taking that line. What he said impugns the value of the three codes of practice that have so far been issued by ACAS, all of which.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0634">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 247</span>
deal with subjects which are desirable to be agreed voluntarily: they deal with the disciplinary practice and procedures in Employment, the disclosure of information to trades unions for collective bargaining purposes and time off for trade union duties and activities. I do not think that the introduction of those codes can be said to have made voluntary agreement any the less likely to be achieved.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) asked whether the codes could be seen now. I understand what lay behind the question. The Secretary of State is not entitled to draw up a code until he has authority from Parliament to do so. But I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that the clause requires the Secretary of State after consultation with ACAS, to draw up and publish a draft. On the basis of whatever representations may be made about the published draft the Secretary of State goes ahead and presents the code to Parliament.<br><br>
I repeat that of course my right hon. Friend will give careful consideration to what has been said. But I cannot go further than that. I must, I fear—I reluctantly have to do this—invite my hon. Friends to reject the amendment if it is pressed to a division.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman started by giving a little encouragement, removed the encouragement, came back for it, and finally removed it again. He says that he will give careful consideration to what we have said, but none the less the answer, chaps, is a lemon—at the end of the day. That puts us in some difficulty. But we shall take what little comfort there may be in that, beg him to do what he has promised—give careful consideration to what we have said—and thank him for his encouraging remarks about the Government's continuing commitment to collective bargaining. I hope that he will not feel under an obligation to keep on throwing emollient phrases in the direction of his hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst). That is a sure way to alienate whatever good will—and there is quite a lot—that there is for the Under-Secretary of State on this side of the Committee.<br><br>
We have learned to understand over the years that if there is one bitter enemy
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 248</span>
of the trade union movement in the House it is the hon. Member for Hendon, North. I shall not pursue that, Mr. Goodhew. We take what little comfort we can from the words of the hon. and learned Gentleman. I advise my hon. Friends not to vote for the amendment but to wait and see if the Government have anything encouraging to say later during the Bill's proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman wish to withdraw the amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that you put the amendment to the Committee, Mr. Goodhew.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 9 in page 3, line 13, after 'approved', insert 'in whole or in part'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we are to take amendment No. 10, in page 3, line 13, after 'Code', insert
<br><blockquote><p>"or the modified Code as the case may be".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) earlier this morning touched on the substance of these two amendments. He was right to draw the Committee's attention to the particular importance of the codes which are the subject of the clause, especially because they will be admissible in the courts.<br><br>
If one of these codes were before the House, the House might feel 99 per cent. of the code was entirely acceptable but that there was one objectionable feature. Hon. Members on both sides would not wish to see a code of practice thrown out of the window because one particular issue is distasteful or not sufficiently thought through and prepared. It should be possible to amend the code, not to allow new matter to be injected into it, but to prevent this take-it-or-leave-it situation, so that parts can at least be dropped from it.<br><br>
Perhaps we are asking for exceptional treatment by allowing a resolution of the House to be amended in that way. On the other hand, we are here to promote the rules of the House. It is not unreasonable to see the issue in that light.<br><br>
There might even be an advantage for the Government—if they reflect on this—to accept the two amendments,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0635">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 249</span>
which hang together. The Government, after all, have a particular legalistic approach to industrial relations. The hon, and learned Gentleman seems to dissent but that is certainly the view of this side of the Committee and I think that it is the view not only of trade unionists outside the House but of the country generally. The country believes that the Government have a legalistic approach and I am surprised that the hon. and learned Gentleman seems to be ashamed of it this morning. I thought that that was what it was all about—bringing law back into industrial relations in a big way.<br><br>
We may well have to discuss the contentious matter of codes on picketing. The law in these matters, certainly in recent weeks, has proved to be very fast changing in its nature.<br><br>
I heard an interesting interview with Lord Denning on the radio this morning. He came across as a very merry old soul, though I am not sure that he has given the nation much cause to laugh in recent weeks. When questioned, he said that he did not make up the law as he went along; he described his operations as "developing" the law. Some of us might say that he is a late developer. Certainly, in that development he has caused considerable confusion in recent weeks. One can envisage a situation in which Lord Denning, or some other learned judge, might be considering a case which had a bearing on a code of practice which was before the House. The Government could not even cover their confusion by accepting or tabling an amendment to that code. They would have to come back at a later date with a new revised code and we should have to go through the procedure all over again. The Government value their time, and it would be a very time-consuming exercise.<br><br>
I hope that the Government may see some merit in accepting these two amendments. They might require, one might argue, exceptional treatment from the House, but I find it difficult to believe that Back Benchers on both sides of the House would reject such a move. I think that they would generally welcome the opportunity, as the hon. Member for Rochdale pointed out, to be able to amend resolutions of the House in this way. By accepting the amendments we are starting on the road to changing the traditions and practices of the House. We could be making a little history this morning, and that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 250</span>
would be no bad thing. I ask the Government seriously to consider accepting the amendments in that light.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A compromise solution between the position outlined by the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) and the Government's position might be for consultation on these matters to be referred to the Select Committee on Employment. That would serve a valuable purpose. It would save time on the floor of the House, and it would also give a representative section of the House an opportunity to consider it. I pass over the fact that the Select Committee has the power to send for persons and papers. I also pass over the fact that the hon. Member for Chester-le Street (Mr. Radice) and myself are also on the Select Committee. It would not only enable the Government to have a view from ACAS; it would also give the Government a valuable view from the Back Benches. I recommend that suggestions to the Minister for serious consideration It could be the way out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that one can have other than some sympathy for what lies behind the amendment. Plainly, the contents of a code of practice are important. Indeed, if they are not important, there is not much point in introducing them. On the other hand, the practical consequences of implementing the amendment are overwhelmingly difficult, and it would represent a constitutional innovation to allow for approval of part of such a code, which is really the effect of the amendments. When this suggestion was made in the Standing Committee on the Employment Protection Bill in 1975 it was resisted on very much the same ground by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in Furness (Mr. Booth). The House has never accorded to itself the ability to pick and choose, to make amendments or to accept this and to reject that, in any form of secondary or delegated legislation.<br><br>
I listened with care to what the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) said about allowing matter coming before the House for a resolution to be amended but not, he said, to inject new matter. It is difficult to see how one could so restrict a power to amend as to exclude the ability to inject new matter. Indeed, one would be hard put to justify a provision that allowed matter to be extrated
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0636">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 251</span>
and did not allow new matter to be injected.<br><br>
However it goes further than that, because the Bill requires that the code of practice shall be approved by resolution of both Houses, and one can readily visualise the difficulties that may result when there are incompatible and conflicting amendments resulting in incompatible and conflicting resolutions of the two Houses. But it goes even further than that, because a code of practice is drafted as a coherent whole. Representations and consultations are invited on the published draft, and it is made on the guidance and on the impression that is offered on the code as a whole.<br><br>
The code being drafted as a coherent whole, and with each point carefully weighted for its effect on another part of the code as a whole, one could well invalidate or distort the value of representations that have been made on the code as published as a whole if one thereafter permitted a part to be taken out, let alone some further provision to be put in.<br><br>
There are, of course, ample opportunities for representation. The clause specifically empowers the Secretary of State to amend the published draft in the light of representations that may have been made, and that, in the Government's view, is a substantial assurance that points made in response to consultations and representations can be embodied in the code before it is presented to Parliament for approval.<br><br>
Each of the three codes of practice to which I have already referred the Committee today, introduced by ACAS during the period of the Labour Government, was presented to the House by that Government under the existing rules and procedure whereby they fell to be approved or rejected as a whole. The Government were content for that procedure to continue to apply to each of those codes of practice for very sound reasons. They are basically the reasons that were advanced by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness in the 1975 Standing Committee. Therefore, regretfully but firmly, I have to advise—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that this would be an innovation, but it would be an innovation that would give extra power to Back Benchers, which is something a lot of us are looking for. He
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 252</span>
stressed that my hon. Friend suggested that one could delete something but not add. If we are to innovate, we should do it with caution and do it modestly. Will the Minister agree that that distinction would innovate in a modest way? If we had the power to add, we could want to add so much that it would completely transform the whole thing, whereas if there was just one little bit which was obnoxious or offensive one could delete just a little.<br><br>
That is a much more modest enterprise in innovation, which in itself could be a very desirable innovation. Perhaps he will give consideration to it.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not against any course of action, because it is an innovation as such. But there is nothing in the amendment—even if that would influence the Government's mind—that restricts any change to an extraction and prevents an inclusion of new material. It refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"the modified code, as the case may he".</p></blockquote>
The significance that I find in this being a constitutional innovation is that the House has found it impossible in the past fully to equate the desirability of being able to debate everything, including secondary and delegated legislation, with the practical need of Governments to get necessary—as they believe it—legislation throughout the House.<br><br>
That is a realistic and fair appreciation, and I am sure that that is why the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness found it impossible to accept the arguments which were put forward in 1975. It is only a sensible appreciation of the realities of life. I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member of Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) about the new Select Committee, and we shall certainly consider his suggestion about consultation with that Committee.<br><br>
Reluctant, but firmly, I must advise my hon. Friends to resist the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand fully the weight of the argument which the hon. and learned Gentleman has used about the difficulties which could be created for the Government and the difficulties of procedure if one were able extensively to amend statutory instruments, but the fact that all previous Governments of whatever party have taken that view does not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0637">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 253</span>
necessarily make it right.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman has said that he is not implacably opposed to innovation. At some time or other, the House must take on board the emasculation Back-Bench Members in respect of delegated legislation and their inability to do other than take it or leave it, holusbolus. It is so great a restriction of the ability of a Back-Bench Member to exercise his judgment has really to make a monkey or rubber stamp of him.<br><br>
I repeat that the fact that successive Governments have not found a way out of this, largely because none of them have sought a way out, and the fact that the House itself has not really taken the thing on board, is no justification for our not considering the matters.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman has said that there are plenty of opportunities for people to make representations. Of course, he is right. That is what the clause says. But what people?—as far as I can make out, except the House of Commons. I am sure that when he publishes a draft he will get observations from the CBI and, doubtless, from a number of trade associations and other employers' organisations as well, the chambers of commerce and the rest. He will also get representations fom the TUC and, doubtless, from a number of individual trades unions as well. I am sure that the many worthy academics who specialise in this field will have observations to make to him.<br><br>
The truth is that if one wants to influence the views of the Secretary of State on a draft code of practice, it is better to belong to somewhere other than Her Majesty's Parliament, because that is the only body which is excluded. We must find some way of doing this. The suggestion put by the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) might be one way. Certainly, I would think it worth looking at if we really believe in the function of Select Committees as monitoring the work of Departments. That would seem, at least on the surface, to be an atractive idea, and it bears thinking about to see whether there are any snags.<br><br>
I do not see why we should not use some proceedure other than the rigid proceedure on statutory instrument. Why is it not possible, for example, for the Government to put down not a motion to approve a statutory instrument but a motion in some such terms as
<br><blockquote><p>"That this House believes it desirable that there be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 254</span>
a code of practice in the following terms."—</p></blockquote>
then reeling off the draft? Such a motion would be open to amendment. It might well be, as the hon. and learned Gentleman has said, that amendments would be put down which flew in the face of one another.<br><br>
So what? That happens in our procedure all the time, does it not? It is hapening in our procedure today. It can always happen. In the end, there is a Government motion on the Order Paper. Mr. Speaker selects amendments. Some may be carried and some may be rejected, but in the end one has a resolution either as it was put down or as amended.<br><br>
One could abuse a procedure like that, it is true. It would take a day of Government time, and all Governments, as the hon. and learned Gentleman said, are jealous of their time, but we are talking about serious things. These are matters of great magnitude, so sensitive that, if we make wrong judgments about them, they can lead to nasty situations, such as the one in which we are landed at present, although I do not ascribe any blame about that. I do not know of any important role that the House of Commons has other than to debate such matters clarify all the issues in daylight over a reasonable period, rather than from 10 o'clock to 11.30 at night under a "take it or leave it" system. If the hon. and learned Gentleman is as keen on innovation as he says he is—I must not misquote him—if he is as little obdurately opposed to innovation as he says he ought to be willing to consult his colleagues about the possibility of finding some procedure which would enable the House of Commons to have the same rights as the CBI and the TUC in influencing the Government's view on whether a draft code of practice needs to be amended or not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cyril Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support these amendments because I believe that a fundamental principle is involved. I very much hope that the official Opposition, either at this stage or on Report, will press the reaction to this clause as expressed in their amendment. I hope they do so not only for the sake of this Bill but so that we have on record the view of the official Opposition, which may well be useful in future years, as to the right of the House to be able to amend matters brought before it on resolution.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0638">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 255</span>
It seems to me that the official Opposition are admitting their belief in a new method of procedure in the House. That is a significant step forward for democracy, and for no other reason than that, I hope that we have it placed on record that that is now the official view of Her Majesty's Opposition.<br><br>
The suggestion that the Select Committee on Employment should be brought in is certainly better than nothing. It is not the ideal solution, if for no other reason than that minority parties have been excluded from so many Committees that have been set up. The Employment Committee is one of them. I am not arguing this morning whether mathematically they were entitled to be on it or not. The fact is that they are not on it, and to that extent therefore it would preclude us, unless we were invited to give evidence, from taking part in the discussions. None the less, I readily concede that at least it would be a step forward if the Government were to say that before any code of practice was introduced they would consult the Employment Committee. That would be a step forward, though not, for me, a totally acceptable one.<br><br>
What we are talking about this morning is the very essence of democracy. As I understand it, it is about people making laws. We, as Members of Parliament, are representative of the people because there are too many people for each person to be involved individually in the process of law making.<br><br>
Under the Bill, as regards codes of practice a Minister of the Crown, consulting people outside the House hut not necessarily inside it, will be able to issue a code of practice—this is the difference between the existing position and the position under the Bill—which will be available for use in courts of law and admissible as evidence. Therefore, in legal terms these codes of practice become extremely important and may well determine the outcome of any case brought before our courts.<br><br>
If that is the position, and if democracy is about the people making laws or the representatives of the people making laws on their behalf, is it not improper that the representatives of the people should not have proper opportunity to say what a law should be?<br><br>
As the clause is drafted, there is no opportunity for any Back-Bench Member
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 256</span>
on either side of the House to amend a code of practice. We are all excluded. We are not excluded from influencing it, but, as we all know, the amount of influence that one has often depends on who are trying to exert the influence—even how much muscle they have on occasion, which Government are in power and so on.<br><br>
My belief is that that influence in a matter of legal importance—I stress "legal importance"—should be properly exerted by elected Members. What is more, it should be not merely an influence but a power given to them to alter the matter which they are being asked to approve if they do not approve of it. But as things stand we either accept or reject—fullstop—with no power to amend. That seems to me, in the context of these codes now being available in courts of law, to be extremely important in the exercise of democracy and what democracy stands for.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been following the hon. Gentleman's speech with care. He will recall that under section 6(11) of the 1975 Act there is the provision that
<br><blockquote><p>"A failure on the part of any person to observe any provision of"</p></blockquote>
an ACAS
<br><blockquote><p>"Code of Practice shall not of itself render him liable to any proceedings"</p></blockquote>
and so forth,
<br><blockquote><p>"but in any proceedings before an industrial tribunal or the Central Arbitration Committee"—</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cyril Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not a court.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not a court—I quite agree—the same formula is adopted. But industrial tribunals and the CAC deal with matters of legal entitlement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not the courts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that the court is not there, but legal entitlement of great significance is dealt with.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's intervention, but the clause goes much further. If, for example, a code of practice or a code of conduct were to be issued on picketing and became a matter for a court of law, with somebody like Lord Denning
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0639">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 257</span>
or anybody else sitting in judgment on it, that code of practice could become extremely important in the whole climate of industrial relations.<br><br>
It is important in those circumstances that Members of the House of Commons should have the opportunity to amend such codes. I hope that the Opposition will press the amendment at some stage of the Bill because it is an extremely important point certainly for minorities, never mind minority parties.<br><br>
Official Oppositions have some influence, though Governments do what they like in the end. In this instance, bearing in mind the legal implications of the clause, I do not think that influence is sufficient. We must have rights. It would be much to the Government's credit if they were to accept that in the end the power in these matters must lie on the Floor of the House of Commons and not exclusively with the Minister.<br><br>
In that way, I accept the spirit of the amendment. May we have some assurance, be it through the Committee or some other method, and preferably backed by the force of law? I am prepared to accept that the Government are honourable and that, if they give an assurance, they will honour it. May we have an assurance that Members of the House of Commons will have an opportunity to state their view on any code of practice and, what is more, the opportunity by vote, even if only by representatives of the House as a whole, to amend that code of practice?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I urge my hon. and learned Friend to think carefully about what the hon. Gentleman has just said. He defended his position on the grounds of precedent. I should have been happier if he had defended it on grounds of principle. Surely, there is a strong argument in favour of giving Back Benchers more say in this matter. While thanking him for his undertaking to consider my suggestion, I urge my hon. and learned Friend, if the Opposition withdraw their amendment, to consider the case that has been made for a further view on the lines of what the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that there is a small fault in the Under-Secretary's logic. He seems to be resisting the amendment principally on the grounds that once
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 258</span>
the Secretary of State has produced a code of practice, it must hang together and that amending any part of it could be damaging to the whole, and he does not want part of a code left in force because the House has taken the other part out. That seems the gist of his opposition to the amendment.<br><br>
I appreciate that we are discussing only subsection (4), but when we come to subsections (6) and (7) we shall be asked to authorise the Secretary of State not only to make up codes of practice as he goes along but also to alter codes of practice as he goes along. The word is "revise"—"revise" or "amend", what is the difference? We are asked to give him the right to
<br><blockquote><p>"revise the whole or any part of a Code of Practice."</p></blockquote>
It is to that phrase, "any part of a code of practice", that I draw particular attention.<br><br>
We shall be asked at a later stage to give the Secretary of State the right to do something which we are told today would be extremely damaging if it were done by the House of Commons. When the Secretary of State decides to revise part of a code of practice, or if he comes with a new code which supersedes part of an old code—not the whole code but part of it—we are told in line 38 that
<br><blockquote><p>"that specified part of it shall cease to have effect."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might shorten matters by dealing with that point. At first sight it is a very sound point. But I think that the hon. Gentleman has overlooked the provision in the clause which says that, if the Secretary of State wishes to amend or revise it in part, he must go through the same consultation procedure as when he introduces the whole thing. That is the answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I appreciate that. But, having gone through the procedure, in the end the Secretary of State is still seeking the power which the Government are attempting to deny the House, namely, power to make amendments or revisions to a code. The House will not be able to do that; it can only accept or reject the whole.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friends, I shall be brief. I suspect that if we changed sides and had a Labour Government on those Benches and a Conserva-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0640">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 259</span>
tive Opposition on these, the Opposition would be saying exactly what we are saying today. It is really a question of the political will of the Government's Back Benches to recognise this argument about the spirit of Parliament being involved in issues of this nature. I sometimes read speeches by leading members of the Cabinet or the Prime Minister talking about the will of Parliament being expressed and the effrontery of any sort of minority to oppose Parliament. It is never anything of the kind. It is the minority or the group who are arguing with Cabinet Ministers or the Departments of Employment or Industry. Parliament is hardly ever involved. One of our great problems seems to be that, whenever a new Government takes office, after a short time they adopt the mantle of the Executive and start to treat Parliament with contempt.<br><br>
This is a classic example of a minor admendment which does not oppose or wreck the Government's plans in any way. It does not oppose the idea of having codes of practice. It does not deny the right of the Secretary of State to write as many codes of practice as he wants. Indeed, he or his Under-Secretary will be able to spend many happy hours penning away at codes of practice for as long as they like. Probably most will be harmless, but occasionally one or two may be dangerous.<br><br>
We are not suggesting that we give the Opposition the right to amend a code of practice. We are not even suggesting that we give the Liberal Party the right to amend a code of practice. What we are suggesting is that the collective will of Parliament should have the right to amend the code of practice. The point there is that there would have to be sufficient Government Back Benchers who agreed with the Opposition before the damned thing could be amended in the first instance, so there is nothing for Government Back Benchers to worry about at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I draw the attention of my hon. Friend and of the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) to the fact that we are not even suggesting that Parliament should have the right to amend? In moving the amendment, my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) said that he is not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 260</span>
seeking power for Parliament to inject anything new. All we are saying is that if a code were put before the House, 99 per cent, of it being acceptable but with one tiny drop of poison in the middle, Parliament should have the right to say that it wants that bit out. It should have the right, if need be, to put its opposition to that little bit on record so that those outside to whom the code might apply would know the degree of parliamentary support or lack of parliamentary support. That is all that we are suggesting—a modest thing—not the right of Parliament to go through a sort of Committee stage on a code of practice before the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend is correct. Indeed, perhaps we should have put down an additional amendment which would have allowed Parliament to write something into the code of practice. However, it does not have that right. I suspect that we may have a code of practice introduced by the Secretary of State and the little drop of poison could be discovered at that stage, but, because the Secretary of State has tied his own hands by not accepting the amendment, it will have to be withdrawn. The whole code could be voted down and we should have to go through the procedure again, wasting valuable parliamentary time.<br><br>
Throughout our proceedings it will be worth recalling the words of the Secretary of State at the last sitting—that it is essential to seek to obtain the good will and agreement of both sides in attempting to put legislation on industrial relations on the statute book. In this context, the Government should have some regard for the integrity and ability of their own Back Benchers and should recognise that they are not all sitting ducks who will troop through the Lobby whenever they are told to. They do have a degree of common sense and understanding of some of the problems of industrial relations, and they will, I am sure accept the spirit of the amendment.<br><br>
We are going through a period—thank God—when increasingly Members of Parliament will demand more and more right to express their opinions on the issues coming before Parliament. In that context, I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I speak briefly with an eye on the clock. I began my initial
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0641">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 261</span>
response by saying that it was impossible not to have sympathy with the ideas and motives behind the amendment. As has been fairly recognised by the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) and others, Government have to balance conflicting interests and have to have regard to the need to get their legislation through the House within a reasonable time. This has been an interesting and valuable debate and I reiterate to my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) that we shall give careful consideration to the important point he made about the possible use in this context of the Select Committee of which he is a member.<br><br>
I have paid particular attention to what the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) said. Certainly, the Government sympathise with the view that when an important influence will flow from a code of practice or other secondary legislation the House of Commons should have an effective say in its formulation. I do not wish to repeat what I have said about the opportunities for that under the existing arrangements, but, of course, individual Members of Parliament can make representations as well as members of the public.<br><br>
I hope that it will be sufficient to say that the Government will give careful consideration of everything that has been said but, unfortunately, without any ability on my part to give any commitment to move</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has used the word "sympathy" several times. If we boil it down, we find that sympathy is all we have had. We did not even get the tea. The hon. and learned Gentleman's main argument earlier that the code had to hang together. That was very much our argument on the injection of new clauses and new matter into the Bill, and the hon. and learned Gentleman was in the forefront of the opposition to our view on that.
