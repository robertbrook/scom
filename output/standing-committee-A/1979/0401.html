	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Goodhew. During the debate on clause 1, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State undertook that he would, if possible, lay before the Committee in draft form the provisions which the Government proposed, should apply to the scheme to provide for payments by the certification officer towards expenditure incurred by unions in respect of holding secret postal ballots. In fulfilment of that undertaking, I have arranged for copies of the document concerning the proposed provisions to be available in the Committee room for the use of the Committee. We are also sending copies of the document to ACAS, the certification officer, the TUC, the CBI and other bodies with relevant experience for their comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure we are grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a further point of order, Mr. Goodhew, when we were discussing schedule 11 at the end of our last sitting, the Secretary of State helpfully told the Committee that the door was still ajar for further representations on that matter. I made the point then that it was very difficult to get that case across to interested parties and asked what might be done to further that cause. I may have missed it, but I do not think there has been any reference in any of the newspapers to the Secretary of States' offer. Consequently, it is difficult to see how interested parties would have any clue about what went on in the Committee and what the Secretary of State said. I wonder whether the Under-Secretary can help us in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, is it possible for a special press notice to go out on this? Indeed, is it possible to circulate the bodies to which the original consultative document was sent, drawing their attention to the fact that the Secretary of State is inviting further
	<span class='label label-info column'>1706</span>
representations? If not, it rather makes a farce of his offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would also be very helpful on Report if hon. Members—or at least the Opposition Front Bench—were given some indication of what further representations there had been in advance of the debate. That would help us in discussing the matter. I do not know whether my right hon. Friends would agree with me, but it would also be very helpful if we had that sort of information in relation to the new clauses on immunities, which the Government will inject at Report stage, because that is new matter and it would be very useful to have some advance indication of representations in that respect, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman will appreciate, this is not a matter for the Chair. I do not know whether the Under-Secretary is able to help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>SHORT TITLE, COMMENCEMENT AND EXTENT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 193, in page 15, line 29, at the end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"save that any order bringing into operation the provisions of section 11 of this Act shall not be effective for any period earlier than one year after the passing of this Act."</p></blockquote>
This is a very simple and straightforward amendment, and it will certainly not take me very long to put the reasons for it to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We take the view that clause 11 is a very bad clause in every respect. We voted against it standing part of the Bill. It is the most serious attack on the rights of working women for many years. It turns the clock backwards against the general progress which has been made in recent years towards improving the position of working women. However, the clause is now standing in the Bill. We feel that it could possibly be somewhat ameliorated if the implementation of that clause were delayed for at least a year after the Bill became law. Many of the injustices would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1707</span>
still be there in any case a year later, and we can do little, if anything, about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A particular difficulty arises in the case of women who are employed by a firm which employs more than five people at the time the women become pregnant. At the time the women are taking time off for maternity purposes, the number of employees has dropped to five and in that way they have lost rights which they had at the time the process started.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most serious injustice and one which can be eliminated by this amendment concerns women who are already pregnant at the time that the Bill is enacted or are pregnant now. These women are entitled to look forward to enjoying certain rights at the time their babies are born or rights of reinstatement after the babies are born which are, as far as we know, about to be taken away from them during the period of gestation. This is a particular injustice. In that sense, this legislation will be retroactive, because the process leading to the final circumstances of maternity has already started. At the time it started, certain rights were available to women nine months hence. It seems particularly unjust that they should lose those rights in the process and, in that sense, this legislation will be retroactive. We have tabled the amendment because it would help to put off the evil day for other women as well. But for those in the category to which I have just referred, it would eliminate that injustice altogether. We feel that that is particularly important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have made the reason for the amendment clear and that the Government will take a sympathetic view. I do not think that they would really wish to impose this specific injustice on what must admittedly be a pretty small number of women simply for the sake of turning down an Opposition amendment. I hope that the Under-Secretary will agree to accept at least the principle of the amendment, whether or not in these precise terms, and assure us that the Government will not impose that injustice on women who have already become pregnant at the time the Bill is enacted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the way in which the hon. Gentleman moved this amendment and for the clear, restrained and precise manner in which he put his point. I understand the argument completely. It has, however, to be remembered
	<span class='label label-info column'>1708</span>
that what we are proposing in clause 11 will affect only a relatively small number of women. It affects, first, the woman who, immediately before she takes her maternity leave, is working for an employer who at that time employs five or fewer people, and, secondly, the woman working for an employer for whom it is not reasonably practicable to permit her to return to her old job nor to offer her an alternative job that would be suitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will be a very small class of women employees. It is also a class of women employees who cannot be identified for certain at the time their pregnancy begins. They can be identified for certain only immediately before their absence begins. Therefore, this is not a case of women in respect of whom a right has accrued already. Someone in the circumstances suggested by the hon. Gentleman will not know, at this juncture let us say that she has recently become pregnant—whether in six months she will be entitled to be reinstated after she has had the baby. It will depend on the numbers employed by her employer immediately before she goes away and on whether he can show that it was not reasonably practical for him to offer her original job back or a reasonably suitable one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government, for the reasons that we gave when we debated clause 11, desire to bring the provisions of the Bill into operation as soon as possible in order to give speedy relief to employers from the burden of legislation. It is tempting to reopen those arguments. The hon. Gentleman conscientiously resisted that temptation, and so must I. I merely remind the Committee that the Government have felt it right to introduce this relief and that their reasons are such that it should be introduced as soon as possible. They will, however, give full publicity to the new provisions so that employees do not forgo their rights through ignorance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is intended that the new provisions will apply to women who, on the date of coming into operation of the section, have not already started their maternity absence. Transitional arrangements will be made by order. They have not yet been fully decided, but it is intended that the changes to the maternity reinstatement rights should apply only where the employee has not, at the operative date, already started her maternity absence. Explanatory leaflets and full publicity for the new provisions are planned to ensure
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1420">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1709</span>
that, as far as possible, women will be made aware of a possible stage in their reinstatement rights. For those reasons, I advise my hon. Friends to resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To say that this will be publicised and that women will know at the start of their maternity absence is not really relevant, because the factors which have made their absence necessary are already in existence. That is our entire point. It is no longer a matter of choice for the woman. By the time she is taking her maternity absence and is being notified of the position, it is too late. She is already carrying a baby. That is precisely the reason for our amendment. It does not help for the Under-Secretary to say that women who find themselves in that position will not lose any rights which have already accrued. They are losing rights by the very existence of clause 11. It is not true to say that they are not losing accrued rights. All women, in one way or another, are losing accrued rights as a result of the clause. Even those working for much larger firms are having it made more complicated and difficult to obtain their rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But that is not the main concern of the amendment. Certainly they are losing rights, and they will lose even the more restricted rights provided in the clause if a change takes place in the number of employees at their firms during the nine months of their pregnancy. That is something that we cannot sensibly amend, because it is not feasible for someone to be at the bedside making a note of the point at which a woman becomes pregnant. That is not on. But at least we can prevent this—I repeat</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>the word—injustice to what the Under-Secretary admits to be a small number of women who have already started the process of pregnancy at the time that the Bill is enacted.</p>
	<p>As the Under-Secretary says, we cannot at this stage—or even at that stage—precisely identify those women. But it is because we cannot identify them that we feel that it would be reasonable for the operation of the clause to be delayed for 12 months.</p>

I hesitate to introduce any arguments about encouragement to abortion and such matters, but I do not think that we can entirely ignore them. My right hon. and hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In brief, the clause requires that a right against action short of dismissal for the purpose of compelling union membership should be enjoyed by, first, conscientious objectors as defined in clause 6(2);
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1422">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1713</span>
secondly, existing employees when a closed shop is introduced; thirdly, those covered by a closed shop agreement which has not received the secret ballot support required by clause 6. It also requires that employers should be able to join as respondents to proceedings for unfair dismissal on such a complaint a union or an individual which induced him to take the action by industrial pressure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 23, which I would remind the Committee is itself an extremely complicated piece of legislation but necessarily so, also currently limits, when there is a union membership agreement, the enjoyment of the right to participate in union activities on the employer's premises. The new clause provides that this limitation will not apply where in future there is a new closed shop without the ballot support required by clause 6 having first been obtained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the opportunity is being taken to clarify section 23 by removing two particular obscurities. The first, section 23(3)(	<i>b</i>)—this is rather remarkable, Mr. Goodhew. I am told that the precise origin or intent of this subsection has not been traced, and we judge that it serves no purpose. It is as though a legislative UFO had intruded upon the UMAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second is section 25(1)(	<i>b</i>). This does not seem correct even for the current provisions, because an employer is allowed the prescribed purpose in some circumstances, for example, section 23(4) and (6), where the individual does not have religious objections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effective redraft of section 23 which the new clause represents and amendments to subsequent sections is necessary logically to ensure that the provisions on actions short of dismissal parallel those on dismissal after the amendments to clause 6 of the Bill have taken effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The earlier clause 13 only protected conscientious objectors. It left untouched the position of existing employees and employees in new closed shops not approved by a ballot. As well as the simple argument of parallelism, it would be objected that, now that these broader categories of employee are protected against dismissal for non-union membership, there would be a greater need to protect against other pressure which would constitute action short of dismissal. The concept of action short of dismissal is not new.

I will go quickly through the sub-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1714</span>
sections more for the record than out of any belief that it is humanly possible to take in their technical content in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) amends section 23(1)(	<i>c</i>) of the 1978 Act by removing the phrase "which is not independent" currently qualifying the references to a trade union in the subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2A)(	<i>a</i>) qualifies the right in section 23(1)(	<i>b</i>) which relates to take taking part in the activities of an independent trade union at any appropriate time in respect of activities at the employer's premises of a union not specified in a union membership agreement. This qualification is to be subject to the new subsection (2B).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2A)(	<i>b</i>) ensures that the right not to have action short of dismissal to compel union membership will apply, when there is a union membership agreement, to the same categories of employees who are protected against unfair dismissal by the new section 58(3A), conscientious objectors, (3B), existing employees, and (3C) when the new union membership agreement has not been approved by the requisite ballot vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2B) removes the limitation in (2A)(	<i>a</i>) above in respect of any union membership agreement which takes effect after the Bill is enacted, unless it has been approved in accordance with sections 58(3C) and 58A.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) repeals section 23(3), (4), (5)(	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>), and section 25(1)(	<i>b</i>), which in the light of the above provisions are no longer necessary or appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4)(1) gives employers facing certain complaints under section 24 an ability to join a union or other person when the employer claims that this union or other person induced him to take the action complained of by calling, organising, procuring or financing industrial action or threatening to do so. The complaints under section 24 for which this joinder is to be available are when the complainant claims he suffered detrimental action short of dismissal taken for the purpose of compelling him to be or become a member of a trade union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4)(2) provides that the tribunal making an award of compensation in respect of the complaint, and finding the employer's claim well founded, may require the joined party to pay a contribution in respect of the compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4) (3) provides that the amount of this contribution shall be what the tribunal considers just and equitable
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1423">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1715</span>
and may constitute a complete indemnity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought it right for the purpose of the record alone to read that, Mr. Goodhew, but the essence of this new clause is to provide parallel provisions in respect of action taken short of dismissal, whose purpose is to compel somebody to become a member of a union—parallel to those which already exist—where the action taken is intended to induce dismissal. For that reason, although I acknowledge that it is a formidable piece of prose, it makes good practical sense, and I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>TIME OFF FOR ANTE-NATAL CARE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>After section 31 of the 1978 Act there shall be inserted—
	<br><blockquote><p>31A.—(1)An employee who is pregnant and who has, on the advice of a registered medical practitioner, registered midwife or registered health visitor, made an appointment to attend at any place for the purpose of receiving ante-natal care shall, subject to the following provisions of this section, have the right not to be unreasonably refused time off during her working hours to enable her to keep the appointment.
	<ol>
	<li>Subject to subsection (3), an employer shall not be required by virtue of this section to permit an employee to take time off to keep an appointment unless, if he requests her to do so, she prod uses for his inspection—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>a certificate from a registered medical practitioner, registered midwife or registered health visitor stating that the employee is pregnant, and</li>
	<li>an appointment card or some other document showing that the appointment has been made.</li></ol>
	<li>Subsection (2) shall not apply where the employee's appointment is the first appointment during her pregnancy for which she seeks permission to take time off in accordance with subsection (1).</li>
	<li>An employee who is permitted to take time off during her working hours in accordance with subsection (1) shall be entitled to be paid remuneration by her employer for the period of absence at the appropriate hourly rate.</li>
	<li>The appropriate hourly rate in relation to an employee shall be the amount of one week's pay divided by—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>the number of normal working hours in a week for that employee when employed under the contract of employment in force on the day when the time off is taken; or</li>
	<li>where the number of such normal working hours differs from week to week or over a longer period, the average number of such hours calculated by dividing by twelve the total number of the employee's normal working hours during the period of twelve weeks ending with the last complete week before the day on which the time off is taken; or</li>
	<li>in a case falling within paragraph (	<i>b</i>) but where the employee has not been employed for a sufficient period to enable the calculation to be made under that paragraph, a number which fairly represents the number of normal working hours in a week having regard to such of the following considerations as are appropriate in the circumstances, that is to say,—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>the average number of normal working hours in a week which the employee could expect in accordance with the terms of her contract;</li>
	<li>the average number of such hours of other employees engaged in relevant comparable employment with the same employer.</li></ol></ol>
	<li>An employee may present a complaint to an industrial tribunal that her employer has unreasonably refused her time off as required by this section or that he has failed to pay her the whole
	<span class='label label-info column'>1718</span>
or part of any amount to which she is entitled under subsection (4).</li>
	<li>An industrial tribunal shall not entertain a complaint under subsection (6) unless it is presented within the period of three months beginning with the day of the appointment concerned, or within such further period as the tribunal considers reasonable in a case where it is satisfied that it was not reasonably practicable for the complaint to be presented within the period of three months.</li>
	<li>Where on a complaint under subsection (6) the tribunal finds the complaint well-founded it shall make a declaration to that effect; and</li>
	<ol>
	<li>if the complaint is that the employer has unreasonably refused the employee time off, the tribunal shall order the employer to pay to the employee an amount equal to the remuneration to which she would have been entitled under sub-section (4) if the time off had not been refused; and</li>
	<li>if the complaint is that the employer has failed to pay the employee the whole or part of any amount to which she is entitled under subsection (4), the tribunal shall order the employer to pay to the employee the amount which it finds due to her.</li></ol>
	<li>Subject to subsection (10), a right to any amount under subsection (4) shall not affect any right of an employee in relation to remuneration under her contract of employment (in this section referred to as " contractual remuneration.")</li>
	<li>Any contractual remuneration paid to an employee in respect of a period of time off under this section shall go towards discharging any liability of the employer to pay remuneration under subsection (4) in respect of that period, and conversely any payment of remuneration under subsection (4) in respect of a period shall go towards discharging any liability of the employer to pay contractual remuneration in respect of that period.</li>
	<li>Until the coming into operation of section 10 of the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Act 1979, this section shall have effect as if for any reference to a registered midwife or registered health visitor there were substituted a reference to a certified midwife."—[	<i>Mr. Mayhew.</i>]</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New clause 16 will occasion less controversy in the Committee but it could scarcely occasion less argument. I commend the new clause to the Committee. It provides for a statutory right for pregnant women employees to be given reasonable time off with pay for antenatal visits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This issue has come to the fore in recent months. In February, the Select Committee
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1719</span>
on Social Services heard evidence from the TUC and others in connection with its inquiry into perinatal and neonatal mortality. The Committee was concerned about the number of pregnant women who did not seek advice from antenatal clinics or who did not seek it early enough. It asked for my Department's view on whether a statutory right should be given pregnant women to paid time off to attend antenatal clinics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter was discussed at the Report stage of the Employment Protection Bill 1975. The then Labour Government did not consider legislation appropriate, pointing out that the maternity allowance and leave provisions contained in the Bill were designed to allow employees to stop work up to 11 weeks before confinement, and suggesting that any reasonable employer could be expected to allow time off for the antenatal visits and the weeks during which the woman was still working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present Government have tended to share this view. But while it is still our belief that the vast majority of employers have for a long time acted in this way, allowing female employees reasonable time off to attend antenatal clinics, the Government have been particularly impressed by the views expressed by the TUC and others that unskilled women workers are among those statistically most at risk of perinatal mortality or handicap, and who are most in need of antenatal care. It is said that it is just these women who appear to stand the greatest chance of finding their employer unhelpful in giving them time off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As with all employment protection legislation, a balance has to be struck and it is not easy. As the Committee knows, we are anxious that employers will not be driven to regard a statutory obligation to provide time off as another reason for avoiding the employment of young women. The Committee knows now the anxiety the Government feel in respect of that factor, which has led to the provisions in clause 11.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here, however, we think that the additional burden on employers would be a light one. The amount of time off is likely to be relatively small, perhaps an average of six visits if the woman continues to work until about the 28th week of her pregnancy. Those employers who already make suitable provision for their female staff—and we believe them to be the majority—will have nothing more to worry about under the new legislation than under the present
	<span class='label label-info column'>1720</span>
voluntary arrangements. There will be those who will question whether, in view of the many voluntary arrangements in force, the case for legislation has been made. The CBI, while agreeing that such voluntary arrangements are not comprehensive, would prefer to encourage the extension of such voluntary arrangements rather than to accept a further statutory obligation on the employers. We fully understand that line of thinking, and note that the CBI has indicated that it would gladly give encouragement and help to employers in fulfilling that voluntary obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, we believe that many women, particularly those on the shop floor who work on a shift basis, clocking on and off, are discouraged from asking for time off for this important reason. We take the view, therefore, that the position ought to be underpinned by legislation, providing for a statutory right that can be relied upon if it is needed, and we trust that this important right to time off will be accepted readily by employers as just, and that it will not have any significant effect on the willingness of employers to employ female staff. The Government attach considerable importance to this matter, as I made clear earlier in the Committee's proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Opposition for bringing the issue to the Committee themselves in the form of new clause 11 which we are taking with new clause 16. The Government's clause takes a different approach from new clause 11. Whereas the Opposition's new clause links paid time off for antenatal care with maternity pay, and therefore imposes the minimum service qualifications which are associated with maternity pay, the Government's new clause links the proposal with the other time off provision, which we believe to be more logical and appropriate. Therefore it does not require any minimum service qualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. and hon. Members on the Opposition benches who have put down new clause 11 have drafted it, if I may say so, with elegance and conciseness, but we have decided that the right to paid time off for antenatal care ought to be based on the need for such care and ought not to be dependent on any service qualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The length of the clause is formidable. It has the advantage that it follows precedent. It is taken exactly in its material particulars from the other time off clauses in the Employment Protection Act, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1426">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1721</span>
much of the clause merely repeats the legislation there to be found upon calculation of pay and on the right to resort to a tribunal. A major advantage of this is that the clause provides for an hourly rate of calculation which is essential to have the necessary flexibility to deal with absences of less than a day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The meat of the clause is in subsections (1) to (4), where its intentions are clearly set out, together with employer safeguards against abuse of this right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 196 to 200 are consequential on new clause 16. New clause 16 inserts a new section 31A in the 1978 Act after section 31, and the amendments insert references to the new section 31A where appropriate in the 1978 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Government's initiative in responding to new clause 11 by introducing their own new clause. My right hon. and hon. Friends and I will be happy not to pursue new clause 11, elegant and stylish as it may be. However, we must be honest. We can take no credit for the drafting of that new clause, much as I should like to do so. It is the work of Anne Dillon of the Spastics Society. I should like to pay tribute to her and to the all-party Disablement Group who have done a great deal to bring this matter to the attention of the House, both to the Select Committee on Social Services and to other Members of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's new clause is more all-embracing than new clause 11. But, whilst loss of wages is one of the factors that inhibit unskilled women from obtaining antenatal care and proper treatment, it is not the only factor. One factor is a lack of knowledge and understanding of the importance of antenatal care, a lack of appreciation and understanding of the treatment given, and a lack of self-confidence in asking questions of the medical staff about care provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Under-Secretary will know, the Spastics Society was instrumental in approaching a firm called Strathkelvin Bonded Warehouses in Scotland. Through the co-operation of its personnel director, Mr. Alistair Robertson, the management in general and the unions, they were able to carry out a pilot project there. The response to that scheme showed that if the facilities were provided and, if the educational opportunities about treatment were given, women were happy to respond and did
	<span class='label label-info column'>1722</span>
respond. The cost of the scheme involved the company in minimal financial outlay. I am sure that the Committee will agree that the scheme at Strathkelvin Bonded Warehouses could well be copied or carried out by other firms throughout the country. At Strathkelvin not only do pregnant women obtain paid leave for antenatal care, but they are allowed to leave work five minutes earlier at lunchtime and in the evening. This avoids the factory gate crush, which is a fear that the pilot scheme showed was expressed by many pregnant women. In addition, at Strathkelvin they are provided with a free pint of milk a day, again at negligible cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause has such widespread approval of the Committee that it is unnecessary for me to speak at any great length on it. I merely want to say that there is need to build on the initiative of the Government in introducing this new clause. I am sure that the campaign launched with the blessing of the Department of Employment, the CBI, the TUC and the Health Education Council to implement other aspects of the general policy to improve the situation for pregnant women at work will be helpful and instrumental in ensuring that there is a lower perinatal mortality rate and a lower morbidity rate. I am therefore most happy to welcome the Government's initiative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Madel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like briefly to welcome this new clause, especially as I was one of the members of the Select Committee on Social Services looking at perinatal and neonatal deaths until the previous Parliament was dissolved in March.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are absolutely right to give pregnant women a statutory right to have paid time off to attend antenatal clinics. The clause is very carefully drafted. The question of any anxiety on the part of the employer is covered by subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>), whereby the woman has to produce:
	<br><blockquote><p>"an appointment card or some other document showing that the appointment has been made."</p></blockquote>
But I think it should be said in passing that we discovered on that Committee that the pattern of antenatal care was very uneven. Some people would have to travel considerable distances to keep appointments for special antenatal care. For instance, within 80 to 150 miles of London, in order
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1723</span>
to get the very best, very often a woman will have to come to a London teaching hospital for care in this way. The time off may be quite substantial if the employee involved is shown to need extra medical care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have said in subsection (6) that an employee, when presenting a complaint, has to show
	<br><blockquote><p>"that her employer has unreasonably refused her time off."</p></blockquote>
I know that one puts in the word "unreasonably" quite a lot. I am not sure how necessary that was, bearing in mind that subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>) shows that an appointment card or some other document has to be produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, in subsection (7) the time for presenting a complaint is three months or, if that was not reasonably practicable, whenever was reasonably practicable. Again, I am guessing; I should have thought the three months might have been extended upwards to six or nine, but I think there is the safety check that the industrial tribunal has flexibility and can rule that if it was not possible within the three months, a further period is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I take the point of the hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) about employees leaving work a bit early and coming to work a bit late to avoid what he described as the factory gate crush. If the clause leads to more flexitime for such employees, that, too, is thoroughly welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have frequently been harshly critical of the Government's behaviour on the maternity benefit aspects of the Bill, and I withdraw nothing of that. They have behaved disgracefully in that respect. But I welcome this new clause. They are perhaps seeking in a small way to atone for past sins. It is probably the only real concession that they have made throughout the proceedings on the Bill. We must be grateful for small mercies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Madel) spoke about the unevenness of antenatal care facilities. He is right. The same point was made during the recent debates on the Abortion (Amendment) Bill. I hope that he will do what he can to press that point home on the basis that the only real remedy is an improved National Health Service—which, of course, means additional public ex-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1724</span>
pedicure. But I shall not strain the rules of order by pursuing that line, Mr. Good-hew. I merely repeat our welcome to this new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I too, am grateful to be able to welcome, for once in the Committee, a Government proposal in social legislation. God knows, in the last 10 months we have had no other opportunity to offer any praise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer briefly to the point made by the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Madel). He referred to the period of three months in subsection (7). The Government could well think about that. They would not think too kindly of amending a new clause on Report, but six months would be better and would bring the clause into line with other representations that we made on clause 4 about the need for time to take a case to a tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause attempts to ease things for women who work in the most menial jobs and whose education is not of the best. The medical authorities have pointed out over the past few years the fall in attendance at antenatal clinics. Anything that will improve that attendance is clearly good, not only for the mothers but for their unborn babies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said repeatedly in the Committee, this is an appallingly bad Bill. When the Labour Party returns to office, we shall dump most of this legislation in the ash can where it belongs. But the Secretary of State may rest assured that this is one clause that we shall retain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the fact that the Cabinet is probably the worst that we have had for 100 years, there remains a spark of humanity within it. For that we must be grateful to the Secretary of State for Employment. We know that he has a difficult task. He is insulted almost daily in the media and probably in the Cabinet, too. But we shall continue to support him when he attempts to put useful items of social legislation on the statute book. We wish him well. If he should need any support, we shall do our utmost to ensure that he gets such legislation through the House, as long as it is of the nature of the new clause and not of the nature of the rest of the Bill.

Perhaps you will recall, Mr. Goodhew, earlier proceedings of the Committee from which the new clause arises. It seems so long ago that we were discussing the changes that the Government were introducing which affected the operation of union membership agreements and the situations to which they applied. I disclosed to the Committee that a particular case being tested in the European judicial institutions had been the subject of submissions by the United Kingdom Government. It was clearly relevant and important to the discussions in the Committee that we should know exactly what line the United Kingdom Government were pursuing in those proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a consequence, I tables a question to the Attorney-General asking that a copy of the United Kingdom Government's submission be made available to Members of Parliament. To my astonishment, I was told that this could not be done. Heaven knows by whom the Commission is appointed. It is certainly not elected by anyone, and it seems that the United Kingdom Parliament has neither influence nor control over the Commission in any way. I was told that the members of the European Commission for Human Rights had determined that whatever was submitted to them by a Government could be treated as confidential and could not be disclosed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that I reflect the views of my hon. Friends when I say that that is outrageous. My hon. Friends might not choose the strong words that I choose. The Committee knows that I am not given to temporising on language when I consider that something deserves outright condemnation. I am not mealy-mouthed. I use
	<span class='label label-info column'>1726</span>
the word "outrageous," and this seems to me particularly so at a time when there is a growing demand for what is called open government and there is a growing demand for reform and relaxation of the Official Secrets Act. To be treating submissions by a Government to this international body as though, somehow, we were dealing with nuclear military technology that had to be classified as top secret is the very opposite to the trends to which I referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I maintain that we ought to know, not merely because it is important to our consideration of this legislation, and not merely because of the bearing that the case might have, and probably will have, on industrial relations in the United Kingdom, but because there is a constitutional dimension. The United Kingdom Government are responsible to the elected representatives of the people in Parliament assembled. That is a fundamental aspect of our constitution. The Government have to answer to Parliament and to Members of Parliament, but apparently not on this matter, not because our Parliament has decreed it, not because our Government have decreed it—much as it might suit their convenience to be able to deal with these matters in such secrecy—but because this European Commission has decided that it can override the United Kingdom Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This may be an exceptional instance, which has been disclosed by pure accident. I do not know. There might be other examples in which the United Kingdom Government, either by wish, design or obligation are treating with other international bodies on a secret basis in a way that provides protection against their being answerable to the United Kingdom Parliament. I submit that it is entirely wrong. On matters such as these, which do not involve questions of international obligations, treaties entered into or questions of military technology, and so on, but which are matters affecting the day-to-day conduct of industrial relations in this country and the millions of workers, or the hundreds of thousands of people professionally engaged in the management of industrial relations on both sides of industry, the people ought to know what their Government are saying elsewhere about these important issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is one in which we are questioning the openness of government and the conduct of natural justice—I use that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1429">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1727</span>
phrase in the colloquial sense rather than in a legal sense. There is also the constitutional question. We are not talking here about a court, I remind the Committee. The issue has not yet reached a court. We are talking about the sieving mechanism that determines whether the matter shall be admissible in a court, and the body that is sieving the matter is a Commission. This smacks of kangaroo court procedures, and I ask my hon. Friends to press the new clause to a Division, unless we receive an assurance from the Government that in future they will make their submissions to such bodies available to those in the House of Commons who are concerned with parliamentary proceedings on such matters. In the absence of such assurances from the Government, I ask my hon. Friends to support the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what lies behind the clause. The right hon. Gentleman has reminded us that he gave us a foretaste of it some time ago. I think that it is exclusively relevant to the European Commission on Human Rights. There may be other examples, but I do not know of any other commission or court in which there is this requirement of confidentiality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current rules of procedure of the European Commission on Human Rights require confidentiality of all case files and pleadings in proceedings before the Commission. In addition, the Convention, to which we are signatories, requires that the Commission shall meet in camera.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the new clause were adopted, we should be in breach of the European Convention. Submissions in cases before the European Court of Justice, which the Committee will recall is a different body, are not subject to similar confidentiality rules, but the Government would not necessarily want to be obliged to disclose its submissions in a particular case, although no firm position on that is taken. Official transcripts are not made of oral submissions to this court. It would therefore be impossible for those to be made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman puts his case on natural justice, and, he says, in a political sense, and also on constitutional grounds. He says that this is a kind of kangaroo court. It is therefore important
	<span class='label label-info column'>1728</span>
to bear in mind the distinction between the Commission, which is, as it were, the kind of filter for complaints made about breaches of the Convention on Human Rights, and the Court of Human Rights, which is where these matters are finally determined. We are faced with this confidentiality rule only in the case of the Commission. The procedure under the convention provides for a complaint being referred to the Court of Human Rights either at the instance of the Commission, at the instance of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, or at the instance of a defendant or respondent to a complaint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The procedure adopted under the European Convention on Human Rights is to aim for a friendly settlement of cases. This could be hindered if at each stage the submissions of one party, the Government, were made public. The clause could also conflict with the principles recognised by Parliament regarding the sub-judice rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the right hon. Gentleman's position. He considers it outrageous that the members of a sovereign Parliament could not know what its representatives are saying elsewhere. But I do not think it is right to say that it is the representatives of a sovereign Parliament who are arguing before the Commission. The representatives argue for the Government. Although I must concede that it is a most remarkable and unique provision, nevertheless the rules provide for the Commission on Human Rights itself to issue a communiqué at the conclusion of its hearing. The communiqués may under the rules contain information to the press to an extent compatible—and I am quoting from the rule:
	<br><blockquote><p>"with the legitimate interests of the parties and subject to any special direction by the Commission."</p></blockquote>
In the case which we have recently had much in mind, the British Rail employees were sacked under the provisions of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act passed by the last Government, because, following the introduction of a closed shop agreement, they declined to join the specified union. Therefore they were sacked without any compensation for unfair dismissal, or any compensation at all. In that case the Commission, after its final meeting on 9th July, issued a communiqué which made clear the nature of the Government's submissions, and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1430">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1729</span>
Government have made no secret since then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the lifetime of the previous Government, the rules of confidentiality were accepted and were quoted when requests were made for reports upon submission of cases before the Commission. The then Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for Leeds, South (Mr. Rees) said in the House of Commons on 12 February 1976 that the report by the Commission on the case brought against the United Kingdom Government by the Government of the Republic of Ireland:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Under the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights … remains a confidential document until the relevant European authorities have released it."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 12 February 1976; Vol. 905 c.346.]</p></blockquote>
There has been a further instance of that being observed. Therefore, it is important to bear in mind that we should be in breach of the Convention were we to enact this new clause, and ultimately we should have to withdraw from the convention if the provision could not be remedied. I do not think that right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite would wish that. If we reached that stage, the need for the clause would be obviated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main argument for the requirement of confidentiality in the convention and in the Commission's rules of procedure is the desire of the Commission to resolve cases by means of a friendly settlement, if possible. This could be hindered if the submissions of one party were made public at each stage. One can see a parallel in the ACAS procedure. ACAS, when it tries to provide a voluntary settlement of disputes, maintains confidentiality between the parties concerned in the belief that this helps the settlement. I dislike—if I may speak personally—barriers upon the communication of information, particularly in the case of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings, unless they are absolutely necessary in the interests of the parties. But for the reasons I have given, it is plain that we ought not to incorporate this new clause in the Bill, sympathetic as I am to the feelings that led the right hon. Gentleman to propose it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will be brief in commenting on what the hon. and learned Gentleman has said. Although he said it sweetly, what he said was totally unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman says he is sympathetic to the point of view
	<span class='label label-info column'>1730</span>
underlying the new clause, but that none the less to accept the new clause would put us in breach of our obligations under the Convention. There would have been a lot of encouragement if he had followed that up logically and said that none the less he would seek to make representations to the effect that perhaps the convention ought to be amended and modified to allow the kind of judicial practice that pertains throughout the rest of the United Kingdom to apply here. But he did not say that. If he wants to get up and say it now, I shall be quite happy to listen to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a unique judicial procedure. When the Commission has finished its hearing, there is a three-month pause in which it makes its good offices available for the purposes of achieving a friendly settlement. We do not have that in our judicial system, though we have it in ACAS. It is perhaps significant that ACAS maintains the confidentiality of the parties' submissions at that stage and for that reason.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman is making my case for me because I was about to point out to him that ACAS is not a judicial body. It does not make judicial decisions, as this body does. The hon. and learned Gentleman quotes in support of this argument the fact that under the previous Government the then Home Secretary told the House what the position was in relation to an Irish question. But the new clause does not deal with any Irish questions or any questions other than those that arise out of the relations between workers, employers, trade unions and employers' associations—matters of very widespread public interest and concern. My point is that the public have a right to know what view the United Kingdom Government are representing elsewhere on judicial matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the hon. and learned Gentleman has confirmed my assumption that this was a unique situation. Its very uniqueness is the case for accepting what we are putting to the Committee—that we should bring this one odd exception to the normal practice and rule into line with the practice everywhere else in our judicial procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quite understand what the hon. and learned Gentleman is saying about seeking to bring about a friendly settlement. But I wonder whether the other parties who
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1431">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1731</span>
might wish to participate in bringing about a friendly settlement have an equal right, as have the Government of the United Kingdom, to make representations before the Commission. I do not think so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly the Opposition have as deep an interest in these matters as the Government have. We represent a different point of view on many of them. We have an alternative point of view. But we are as concerned as are the Government to ensure that people's rights are maintained, that there is a good relationship between workers and employers and between workers and workers. But we are not given the opportunity to go along and present our alternative point of view. I hope that if we were able to, we should not do so in a covert, surreptitious way which would give the impression that we might say one thing in public and another behind closed doors. We want to be able to express our view publicly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman suggests that there is nothing in our judicial procedures akin to this approach of bringing about a friendly settlement. I thought that in recent years the whole approach to family matters before the courts was to achieve just this—to bring about friendly settlement of matters that had more regard to the realities and</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>(2A) The provisions of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 as amended by the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Amendment) Act 1976 shall apply to the House of Commons Commission, to employment under that Commission and to staff so employed as they apply to the Crown, Crown employment and Crown employees."—[	<i>Mr. John Grant</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>practicalities of the situation than to the dead letter of the law. That is right. But it is not done in secret behind closed doors. It is done openly so that all the parties know what is said.</p>
	<p>Of course, those are very private matters, and it could be argued that because they are private the discussion should be limited to the private parties, and that their private matters did not amount to matters of public interest. But it could not be argued in this case because what is at issue is the public interest. These are matters of widespread public concern, and the public are entitled to know what the Government are saying outside the country. Certainly we in Parliament have a duty to know and a duty to find out, because the Government are responsible to us as Members of Parliament. That is our constitution, and this is a flagrant defiance of our constitution.</p>
	<p>Forgive me, Mr. Goodhew, if I tend to become somewhat intemperate, but it is a matter of great concern to me. I do not intend to detain the Committee any longer. I ask the Committee to support the clause, and I urge my right hon. and hon. Friends to express their view by their votes.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the clause be read a Second time:</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 9, Noes 13.</p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important new clause because it deals with the rights in the House of Commons of those who, in effect, work for us. In moving the new clause I had hoped to be brief, in the belief that, for the second time this morning, the Government would show enlightenment and accept the new clause. But I understand that they are unable to do so, therefore the Committee must forgive me if I take a little longer in arguing the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed, too, because during our debates I recall that the hon. and learned Gentleman himself expressed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1432">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1733</span>
strong views about the need for reforms in the House of Commons. The Minister talked about the antiquated character of some of the activities that we carry out. I think that he referred to the Speaker's wig and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here is another example of the antiquated way in which we deal with matters in the House of Commons, and it is not, in any sense, a party issue. There is an opportunity for Conservative Members—the silent majority in the Committee for so long, with exceptions such as the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst)—to speak. The hon. Member for Hendon, North may not be sympathetic to the clause, but in general the silent majority on the other side might feel that this is an opportunity for them to throw off the constraints that have beset them throughout our debates. I do not think that even the Secretary of State would look unkindly on Conservative Members in the Committee if they chose to vote in favour of the new clause. The Prime Minister might not feel kindly towards them if the matter got back to her, but I doubt whether any bright young careers would be severely blighted if they supported the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Whitley Council, which represents the staff of the House of Commons and which was formed just under 10 years ago, has always had as its aim that major industrial relations legislation, which we approve in Parliament, should apply to the staff of the House of Commons as well, at least to the extent that it covers the Civil Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that it is anomalous that we should pass laws that apply to almost everybody else, yet the people who service us as Members of Parliament are excluded from the protection afforded by the legislation. I know that it has been resisted in the past on grounds of uncertainty about the true employer, and there has been also the question of parliamentary privilege. However, when Ministers have wanted to cut through this kind of argument, they have managed to do so. Even so, there have been omissions and new law has not been made retrospective. That is why there is a need for the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During debates on the Employment Protection Bill, various assurances were given that the staff here would be treated similarly to civil servants. During the course of those debates there was a new clause on Report to apply that Bill to parliamentary staff, and it is right to record
	<span class='label label-info column'>1734</span>
that all hon. Members who took part in the debate supported the proposal, including the then Conservative Front Bench spokesman. The hon. Member who moved that new clause at the time said that it was not good enough to apply the matter only by analogy. He pointed out that without the force of law behind it, the matter could be capriciously interpreted. That that is true, and I hope to show, perhaps not a capricious interpretation, but a slothful attitude in interpreting the provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Eventually there was a Government amendment which applied the unfair dismissal provisions of TULRA but not the other provisions. Nor did the health and safety legislation apply, and it still does not, but we are not entitled to discuss that this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But once again there was a Conservative welcome for that particular new clause from the previous Government. It is worth recalling that the then Conservative spokesman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I think that all hon. Members would agree in the common aim, which is to ensure that those employed in this House enjoy the protection of legislation of the kind we have been discussing in the same way as do people employed elsewhere. I take this opportunity of welcoming the fact that a way has been found of ensuring that just that happens."—	<i>Official Report,</i> 29 October 1975; Vol. 898. c.1698]</p></blockquote>
So it is very much a non-party matter that we are discussing. All we seek to do in this new clause is to extend what one might call the principle that was welcomed in those words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1975 a report was published by the Committee of the House of Commons Administration—the Bottomley Report. There again, the committee noted that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that staff of the House should be brought formally within the scope of legislation affecting their conditions of service. We have no doubt that these views will be fully considered by the House authorities concerned."</p></blockquote>
That was a pious hope. Whatever consideration may have been given by the House authorities, we are still waiting for some sort of action to result from that consideration, and it has not happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the publication of the Bottomley report there was a good deal of pressure to get implementation of the various recommendations that that report made. Eventually the House of Commons (Administration) Act 1978 was passed and that finally laid to rest the old Civil Service pretext for inaction that there was doubt about the employer of the staff. That was put on one side, as it were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1433">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1735</span>
The need for staff rights to be on a statutory basis, rather than on the basis of assurances and analogies, can be illustrated. One can go back quite a long way to 1955 when the then Prime Minister, Sir Winston Churchill talked about the Government favouring the compilation of a code to govern the conditions of service of the staff of the House. Both the Compton report, to which I have not previously referred, and the Bottomley report mentioned the need for a code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet, six years after Compton, there is still very little progress to report on this front. I am told that there is a summary staff handbook, and that standard letters of appointment are still under discussion. In the Civil Service, staff rules are set out. In the "Pay and Conditions of Service Code" the rules are set out and have legal backing. Yet, here, of course, the rules that would apply are dealt with on a selective basis, and therefore a great deal of uncertainty results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, the senior officials—the authorities of the House—decide whether to apply the various legislation, by analogy or not. There have been various pressures from the staff side who have been in touch with the House of Commons Commission about this matter for a long time. So far as I can make out, the only reply they received was in July of last year, that the paper that they had submitted setting out their case had—not for the first time—been passed on to the board of management. Since then it seems to have disappeared into a bottomless pit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot really believe that it is right that officials of the House should be able to pick and choose among the various legislative provisions in the way that they do now, on no basis that we know about and without consultation with the representatives of the staff concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for TULRA itself, the Act is concerned with the status and regulation of trade union immunities, and with collective agreements. The real relevance for the House is not the immunity side. The staff are concerned with the part which refers to collective agreements. In particular, TULRA lays down the conditions for a no-strike clause in a collective agreement to be valid, and among those conditions is that it must be included within a worker's individual contract. The staff of the House do not have contracts, although I gather that some of those who have been appointed
	<span class='label label-info column'>1736</span>
in recent years have had letters of appointment, so there is a particular problem there. I understood that the Government had considered the point about contracts, but they seem to have come to the conclusion that it is not necessary for them to take any steps to put the matter right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by summarising the arguments. First, I do not think that it is right to suggest that the unions in this House are asking for any special treatment. They want to be brought into line with the Civil Service in relation to TULRA—they would obviously like it to extend to other legislation, particularly health and safety legislation, but we cannot discuss that this morning—so that their conditions of service are in line with the House of Commons (Administration) Act 1978, and they have rights within TULRA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair to say that the staff have tried very hard to adopt a reasoned approach. They have put their views in writing, both to the House of Commons Commission and to the Government. The Government have not had very long to consider the matter and it would be not unreasonable for the hon. and learned Gentleman to say that perhaps the previous Government should have done more to put things right. However, here we actually have a Bill—a vehicle for doing the job—which we did not have in the latter period of the Labour Government. This gives us an opportunity to deal with the matter. The unions involved have tried hard to put their case across in a reasonable way to the Commission and have got nowhere at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a party matter. Everybody who has spoken in debates on this issue has been in favour, and there has been general agreement in the past that the staff of the House should have the same statutory rights as civil servants. The House should now ensure that industrial relations legislation applies to its own staff in the same way as it does to the rest of the Civil Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is strong feeling among the staff about this matter. No one should introduce any red herrings and say the staff are all raring to go and that there is some kind of industrial action in the air. There is nothing of the kind, but there is a principle here and I feel strongly about it. Perhaps it does not go much further than that, but they feel that they are not being adequately treated by the management, and that they should not be fobbed off any longer by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1434">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1737</span>
complaints being passed on, never to be heard of again. That is what has been happening. It seems to be an exercise in " playing for time," perhaps in the hope that the whole issue will go away. But clearly, it will not go away. There is an opportunity here for the Government to put right an injustice to the people who actually work for us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of this new clause is to apply the provisions of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 to staff of the House of Commons to the same extent as those provisions apply to Crown servants. Everything that could possibly have been said in support of the new clause has been said by the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant.) I hope he will not take it as any intended discourtesy if I do not follow, point by point and argument by argument, the speech that he has just made. Our response to this new clause is conditioned by the existence on the statute book of the House of Commons (Administration) Act 1978—a relatively new statute setting up the House of Commons Commission as a relatively new body charged with important functions of the administration of the House of Commons and its staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is perfectly correct when he says that House of Commons staff are not covered by employment protection legislation unless this is specifically provided in the statute. The reason is that generally such staff do not fall within the definitions of employee or worker, as they do not have contracts of employment and are not Crown servants. However, in general, their terms and conditions of employment are closely related to those of Crown servants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, the hon. Gentleman was correct when he said that some employment legislation was directly applied to House of Commons staff for the first time, to the same extent as the relevant provisions applied to Crown servants, in the Employment Protection Act 1975. This encompassed various provisions of that Act and of the Contracts of Employment Act 1972, as well as the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 in so far as it dealt with unfair dismissal. The Equal Pay Act and the Sex Discrimination Act were also applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What Parliament, under the previous
	<span class='label label-info column'>1738</span>
Administration, enacted the House of Commons Administration Act 1978, it set up a Commission which consists of Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the House of Commons, a member of the House of Commons nominated by the Leader of the Opposition, and three other hon. Members of the House of Commons, none of whom may be Ministers. The Commission has the function of an employer and has the duty to determine—this is the important point for the purpose of the new clause—the terms and conditions of service of the staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under section 2(2) of that Act these must be kept broadly in line with those in the Civil Service—that is, the Home Civil Service—the Act continues that these must apply so far as consistent with the requirements of the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That provision came into force on 1 January 1979. The Commission, with its distinguished and unique composition, has expressed the firm view that further legislation, such as the new clause, would have the effect of circumscribing the responsibility of the Commission for applying employment legislation by analogy so far as was consistent with the requirements of the House of Commons. It was stated that it would thereby undermine the position of the Commission when it was only just beginning to exercise its responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman spoke about negotiations that have been in course for some time. I believe that negotiations involving the Commission have been in progress since January this year. They are certainly current with unions in the House, concerning various provisions under the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I may be wrong, but my information is current and I shall be surprised if there are any actual negotiations in train at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1739</span>
that that is not correct, and that the Commission certainly wishes to have negotiations, and wishes negotiations to continue. My understanding, which I confirmed yesterday, is that negotiations are current and that it is the intention of the Commission to pursue them. For that reason the Government believe that it would be wrong to pre-empt by legislation the outcome of those negotiations, and to go behind the Commission which has so recently been set up by the House as a whole to govern these difficult and, so to speak, unique matters. They are unique because of the special circumstances in which the excellent staff, by whom we are fortunate enough to be served, serve this House and everyone in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said at the outset, it is entirely on the existence of the statute and of the Commission that I deal with the new clause. It must be wrong at this juncture—I do not enter into the merits of the issues which are the subject of negotiations—to undermine the standing of the Commission and to pre-empt the outcome of the negotiations which it is pursuing and which it wishes to pursue to a successful conclusion. For that reason, I must advise my right hon. and hon. Friends to resist the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not at all convinced by the hon. and learned Gentleman's arguments. He was kind enough to run over my initial points and to say that they were all correct. That is not surprising. Like other hon. Members who seek information on a variety of subjects, I was well and accurately briefed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it is clear that the Government will not shift. I well understand the hon. and learned Gentleman's point about not wishing to undermine the Commission. But in the end one comes back to a fairly simple principle. We are setting ourselves on one side as an employer. We are saying that we are unique and that the legislation which we pass, and to which we make no other exception, should not apply to the staff of this House. We are talking about a principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all right to say that the Commission was set up in 1978. It has had two years at least in which to make some progress on this front. Frankly, the record is pretty bad. It has made very little effort. If the hon. and learned Gentleman is correct that negotiations are going on—though that does not tally with my information—that
	<span class='label label-info column'>1740</span>
must have been a belated move by the Commission, or, more likely, by the Board of Management, because I understand that the Commission has shifted its executive managerial function to the Board of Management and has left it to the board to conduct negotiations. If negotiations are going on, that is a belated conversion to the idea that something should be got moving. I can only assume that it is in some way a response to the new clause, which was tabled some time ago. The Commission realised that we should have this debate and that we might wish to pursue the matter further at a later stage, if we are able to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find the situation entirely unsatisfactory. I am reluctant to do this but, in view of the Government's attitude and the fact that we have had no assurance of progress being made, I shall ask my right hon. and hon. Friends to join me in dividing the Committee. I hope that some hon. Gentlemen will feel able to join me as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. James Prior)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just before the hon. Gentleman advises his colleagues accordingly, perhaps I may say that the debate that has taken place this morning will obviously be read by the Commissioners, and I should have thought that they would realise that there is strong feeling in the Committee on this subject. As my hon. and learned Friend has said, negotiations are going on and that is why we believe that it would be wrong at this stage to accept the new clause. We must allow the Commission to get on with its work in its own way. But this debate will be read. I recognise that there is strong feeling, certainly on the Opposition side, and I shall report that. But I should not want this in any way to be considered a concession to the hon. Gentleman's point of view, although I recognise that it is a strong one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Secretary of State for saying that. It does not really take us any further, but I accept that it indicates that the Government appreciate the strength of the feeling that exists. From what he said, I take it that he or one of his colleagues will have further discussions with the Commission about these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will not make a great deal of difference whether or not I divide the Committee, but I shall divide the Committee because

I should like some indication of whether there is any support for this point of view on the Conservative side of the Committee, bearing in mind that on previous occasions, as I said earlier, there has been all-party support—including Front Bench support—for moves of this kind.

	<div class='title'>MINOR AND CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. James Prior)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 195, in page 17, line 6, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"7A. In paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 1 to the 1975 Act, after the word 'full-time' there shall be inserted the words 'or part-time.'"</p></blockquote>
The effect of the amendment would be to allow a chairman to be appointed to ACAS on a part-time rather than a full-time basis, at, of course, the Secretary of State's discretion. It would bring it in line with the Manpower Services Commission and the Health and Safety Commission where the present requirement is simply to appoint a chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of ACAS, the current requirement is to appoint a full-time chairman. In practice, all these appointments—to the MSC, HSC and ACAS—have been full-time appointments. It is thought that, when we come to appoint a further chairman for ACAS on the retirement of Mr. Mortimer at the end of this year, we may need to look rather more widely than for someone prepared to do it absolutely as a full-time job. It was therefore thought reasonable to bring this into line with the other two commissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Mortimer has done an excellent job for ACAS. It has not been easy for him in the early years. One of my first acts on assuming office was to re-appoint him for the period of time for which he wished to be appointed—which was to the end of the year. We have not yet begun discussions</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1742</span>
	<p>is in government, that will be something of an indictment of attitudes. I hope that some hon. Gentlemen will feel able to join us.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the new clause be read a Second time:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 9, Noes 13.</p>
	<p>on a successor to Mr. Mortimer, but I am a little worried that we may need the wider discretion of being able to appoint someone who did not give his whole time to ACAS.</p>
	<p>It could be argued in any event that now that ACAS has got on its feet and now that we have taken away some of the statutory recognition clauses, perhaps the volume of work will be not quite as great as it was before.</p>
	<p>I want to make it absolutely plain to the Committee that there is simply no intention or design, by making this small change, in any way to undermine the authority of ACAS or the position of any future chairman. Although I think that the amendment would be a very helpful step in giving us a wider field from whom to select, I would not proceed with the amendment if for one moment I believed that it would be attributed in that way.</p>
	<p>It is absolutely essential that ACAS should be totally independent and should not become a football to be kicked around by succeeding Governments or by one party to another party. I would not want the amendment to become the centre of controversy, although I believe that it would perhaps help us to secure the right type of person.</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Giles Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there is a part-time chairman, who would have the executive authority? Who would be full-time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I imagine that the part-time chairman would still have executive responsibility because he would obviously have to be someone who would give the vast majority of his time to ACAS anyhow.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1437">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1743</span>
We certainly would not appoint anyone who was not prepared to do that. Again, I would assume that he would have the same relationship to the chief conciliation officer as the present chairman has to the chief conciliation officer, who deals with an enormous amount of conciliation work in any case. With the fact that I think that the work load will be eased and with the fact that this would merely be putting ACAS into the same sort of position as with the Manpower Services Commission and the Health and Safety Commission, I think that this is a sensible precautionary step to take which could be welcomed by both sides of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at the line which the Secretary of State is taking. He suggests that the work load of ACAS will be reduced in the future and that this should not be a matter of controversy. Surely the Secretary of State is a realist enough to know that once this legislation is on the statute book, given the attitudes and policies of the Government, industrial unrest will grow alarmingly in the future, and anyone can see that the role of ACAS will have to increase if it is to attempt to solve some of the problems which will be created by his Government. This is a matter of controversy. This is undermining the position of ACAS, not strengthening it in any way whatsoever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I felt that, I would certainly appoint a full-time chairman. That would be the way round. There is nothing in the amendment in any way to prevent the appointment of a full-time chairman. The chairman of the Manpower Services Commission is a full-time chairman. He does not have to be; it happens that he is. This is designed merely to give greater flexibility in whom one appoints. It does not mean for one moment that one will necessarily appoint a part-time chairman, but it does give that greater flexibility. It is for that reason that I think it is a worthwhile amendment. I shall listen to what the Committee has to say, but I really believe that this is something on which we ought to reach agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric G. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not the intention of anyone on this side of the Committee to arouse controversy about ACAS. In some respects, we have been a little reassured by what the right hon. Gentle-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1744</span>
man had to say, although we wish that he were not persisting with this amendment. We believe that ACAS has done a remarkable job since it came into existence in 1974. We do not want to see any action taken or any suggestion made which could be interpreted in some quarters as diminishing the role of that body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to pay tribute to Mr. Jim Mortimer. He has done a remarkable job since he has been the chairman of that body. I am only sorry that he wishes to retire in a few months' time. When I was Secretary of State for Industry, there was one occasion when I suggested to my right hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Foot) that Mr. Mortimer ought to be transferred from his present job to head a major nationalised industry. I am sure that he could have done that job extremely well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Steel!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wanted to steal Mr. Mortimer away from his job, but I was given a very dusty answer by my right hon. Friend, who was right. It is much better that he stays in ACAS and does the work that he has done there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman has said that it is certainly his intention to appoint a successor to Mr. Mortimer on a full-time basis, if he can find a suitable person. That is the 64,000 dollar question—whether there is someone of the reputation and high calibre of Mr. Mortimer available. I am sure that there is in the world of business and trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman has probably seen the article in 	<i>The Times</i> of yesterday by Mr. David Felton, labour reporter, in which he says that there is some
	<br><blockquote><p>"speculation that the role of ACAS may be reduced after the chairman, Mr. James Mortimer, retires next January."</p></blockquote>
There are those in the Government who are arguing that, because the recognition powers are being taken away from ACAS as a result of this Bill, perhaps it is not a full-time job after all. We do not share that view. We have made all the points that we want to on the question of recognition and we certainly note that ACAS was not particularly happy with the recognition roles. But in our view an appointment of a part-time chairman would certainly be interpreted by some people as diminishing the role of ACAS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1438">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1745</span>
Practical problems would result. For example, one of my hon. Friends has put to me the question that it would be difficult for the parties to have confidence in ACAS if its new chairman is not a well-known person and is available only on a Dyno-rod basis. I do not know what that means. My right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) has explained that if somebody gets into what he euphemistically calls the fertiliser, then the Dyno-rod basis is called for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A telephone call— Quick! I am up to the neck in it!"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the interpretation, is it? I see. I think that that could take place, and it bears on the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Chesterle-Street (Mr. Radice). It is a question of who takes the important conciliation initiatives. On the basis of the ACAS annual report for 1978, we can see how it has been able to conciliate and take action in thousands of disputes, many of which have resulted in success. There are graphs on pages 11 and 12 of that report which show the tremendous success which that body has had.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our judgment is that the right hon. Gentleman ought not at this stage to persist with the amendment because it could receive unfavourable reaction outside. It could be interpreted by perhaps mischievous people in some quarters as diminishing the role of that body. It is one of the few areas of industrial relations legislation or practice which enjoys some consensus. In some respects ACAS is a bipartisan body. I know that some people have reservations, such as the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst), but when it comes to the two major political parties in the House of Commons, we want to see ACAS successful. We do not want to see any action taken which in any way would call that success, and the body's wonderful work, into question. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will therefore withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the right hon. Gentleman has said that he wanted this flexibility because the nature of the job might change, I could have understood that. I should not have agreed with him but I could have understood his attitude. But I find it incredible that he should say that he wants to have this flexibility in case someone
	<span class='label label-info column'>1746</span>
he wishes to appoint would rather work part-time. Surely the determining factor should be the objective one relating to the nature of the job, not the subjective views of someone whom the Minister might wish to appoint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have never known a vacancy of any kind in which the job description says " This may be a full-time or part-time job and that will be decided according to the wishes of the successful applicant." I find it astonishing that the Secretary of State should take this view. To tailor the job to the wishes or desires of the person who is to do it, which is what the right hon. Gentleman apparently wishes to do, is no way in which to tackle such an important post as this. The amendment devalues the importance of the post, and I feel strongly opposed to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) has put his finger on the issue at stake. What does the right hon. Gentleman mean by "part-time"—four days a week, three days a week, two, one or half a day a week? He suggests that this gives him flexibility. If the issue arose, and the right hon. Gentleman appointed a well-known individual from the lists of "the great and the good", and the appointment was announced on the basis that the individual said that he could do the job only part-time, that down-grades the job, irrespective of what the Secretary of State said. Whatever other job the person has, it must be taking priority over the one in ACAS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State stated that he regarded the role of ACAS as being reduced. He is living in dreamland. The task of ACAS will be enhanced in the future because of the industrial unrest which will occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue must be recognised—namely, that there are strong feelings within Parliament that at the end of the Bill's passage the Secretary of State will either get the sack or be forced to resign. What happens when one of the hard-line hopes in the Conservative Party is elevated to the position now held by the right hon. Gentleman? Shall we have someone who will deliberately downgrade the job on the grounds that it is no part of the State's duty to intervene in industrial disputes, and that the participants must get on with it and fight in the best way that they can?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to the Secretary of State that either the clause has been forced upon him
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1439">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1747</span>
so that his successor may downgrade the job, or that he is being weak-kneed in this respect and that he should not accept the situation that the chairman of ACAS should be appointed on a part-time basis. Clearly, no matter what soothing words the Secretary of State may use to the Committee, this will be seen and recognised as a downgrading of the role of ACAS and we know that certain of his right hon. and hon. Friends will welcome that step. It is not the majority view in the House that ACAS, which has done a magnificent job over the past four or five years, should be downgraded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For his own future, when he comes to write his memoirs, I hope that the Secretary of State will recognise that he is adopting a retrograde attitude today, and that he should withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it extraordinary that the Secretary of State should find it necessary to tell the Committee that he thinks that it may not be possible to find somebody to take on a job of this importance full-time. Although the right hon. Gentleman may have a view about the work load, I doubt that that view would be generally held in the light of the likely industrial relations situation that we may face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the right hon. Gentleman has lost already the presentational battle, because I am afraid that what he has told us this morning will be seen by most people as not much other than a confirmation of the story which my right hon. Friend read out from 	<i>The Times—</i>that there are those in Government who would prefer this to be a part-time appointment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the right hon. Gentleman actually consulted the TUC and the CBI, and particularly the TUC and CBI members of the ACAS Council, on this matter? Indeed, has he consulted Mr. Mortimer as to whether he thinks that the job can be done on a part-time basis?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not thought that if I ever came to write my memoirs this matter would have a too prominent place in them. I shall have to revise my views after listening to the hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans). He asked me what I meant by "part-time" Anyone who took on this job would have to give it the necessary amount of time which is required to do the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1748</span>
job properly. There is some misapprehension about what the chairman's job entails. One has to distinguish between the work load on officials, which is really the point made by the hon. Gentleman—those, for example, who are directly involved in conciliation and perhaps advisory work—and the duties of the chairman and the council; and of course, the officials work within the broad framework of legislation and council policy. Mr. Mortimer has directly been involved in only a minority of even the major disputes, because on the whole it is something that is left to the chief conciliation officer. Much of Mr. Mortimer's work has been in what one might call evangellsing and publicising the work of ACAS. It is important that we get the right man, rather than to predetermine the fact that he must be absolutely full-time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) asked me about people's views. The CBI and the TUC have been consulted. No objections have been raised by the CBI. Mr. Mortimer has also indicated that he has no objection and he understands the reasons behind the amendment. No response has been received from the TUC. It is possible that we shall receive an objection from the TUC. It objected on a previous occasion, I understand, when there was some question of appointing a part-time chairman to the Manpower Services Commission, but that was some while ago. It may be that it would object to this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) is getting it wrong if he really believes that I would try to fit the work load of ACAS into what time was available for the chairman. That is getting the role of the chairman wrong in relation to what ACAS as a whole does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said at the beginning that I did not wish to do anything which would undermine the effectiveness of ACAS. I said also that I did not wish to take any step which would in any way lead the Opposition to believe that we were not as committed to an independent conciliation and arbitration service as they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that in mind, I shall withdraw the amendment. I shall think about it between now and Report. If I really believe that this will seriously render it more difficult to get the sort of person than I want, I may come back to it on Report. I should like to make it absolutely clear that although this is a Government
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1440">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1749</span>
provision, it was entirely my decision to table this amendment. I have not consulted my Government colleagues on this amendment. It was entirely my own work, and therefore I feel entirely entitled at this stage to withdraw the amendment and to give it further consideration.

It was not merely that the TUC objected but that Ministers themselves said, for the reasons that we have advanced the case this morning for a full-time chairman of ACAS, that there ought to be a full-time chairman of the MSE and that they were not prepared to let that individual have the choice.

	<span class='label label-info column'>1750</span>
The effect of this amendment, which was requested by ACAS, is to empower the conciliation officers of ACAS to conciliate at the request of either employer or employee while an employee who has been given notice of dismissal but not merely complains of unfair dismissal is still serving that notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is largely technical and corrective. Its effect is to empower the conciliation officers of ACAS to conciliate in those circumstances. The present clause allows the conciliation officers to intervene only after the employee has left the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The significance of the amendment is apparent only when it is read in conjunction with section 140 of the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978. Broadly, one purpose of section 140 is to render void any agreement reached between employer and employee to the effect that the dismissed employee should not make a complaint of unfair dismissal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the main exceptions to this principle is agreements reached with the help of a conciliation officer, otherwise the whole purpose of conciliation would be defeated. This amendment merely extends this exception to agreements reached with the help of a conciliation officer after the employee has been given notice of dismissal but while he is still serving that notice. It in no way attacks the principle of section 140 but corrects an anomaly in the Act whereby the employee who has reached a conciliated settlement may still bring a tribunal complaint merely because a settlement was reached before he had actually left the firm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore think that this can be regarded as a useful piece of tidying up. For greater clarification, it is put forward at the request of ACAS, and I do not believe that it need cause any difficulty or controversy in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We have tabled this amendment because we are puzzled about the purpose of the Government's intentions. I see from the background note which the Government have helpfully provided that paragraph 17 of the schedule is a minor amendment to section 140 of the 1978 Act. I am not sure whether it is minor. Perhaps the Government will explain.

May I try to go through this complex maze? Section 140 of the 1978 Act, which is referred to in paragraph 17, starts:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1) Except as provided by the following provisions of this section, any provision in an agreement … shall be void in so far as it purports:
	<ol>
	<li>to exclude or limit the operation of any provision of this Act; or</li>
	<li>to preclude any person from presenting a complaint to, or bringing any proceedings under this Act before, an industrial tribunal."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
Subsection (2) goes on to provide certain exceptions to the rule laid down in subsection (1). Subsection 2(	<i>b</i>) provides that subsection (1) shall not apply
	<br><blockquote><p>"to any union membership agreement so far as it affects the rights of an employee—
	<ol>
	<li>under section 23 in accordance with subsection (4) of that section;</li>
	<li>under section 58 in accordance with subsection (3) of that section."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
May I, for the purpose of trying to understand it, refer to only one of those two exclusions—the section 23 exclusion under subsection (4)? Subsection (4) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) In relation to such an employee "—</p></blockquote>
already referred to above—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the right conferred by subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>) in relation to the activities of an independent trade union shall extend to activities on the employer's premises only if that union is a specified union.</p></blockquote>
The right conferred by subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>) is the employee's right not to have action, short of dismissal, taken against him as an individual by his employer for the purpose of, amongst other things,
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>b</i>) preventing or deterring him from taking part in the activities of an independent trade union at any appropriate time, or penalising him for doing so."</p></blockquote>
What the Government are saying is that where, as at present, there is a union membership agreement and there are recognised unions, an employee who is not a member of a recognised union shall not have the right to move around involving himself in trade union activities with complete immunity from action by his employer but that, in future, he will be able to do so. If that is not the meaning, I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary would tell me what it is. That is what it seems to me to be doing. Why it does that, I do not know. It cannot be intended to produce nor will it have the effect of producing a beneficial influence on industrial relations in that situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a technical amendment that is made by paragraph 17 of schedule 1. It is paragraph 17 which is sought to be left out by the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 140 has a long history. It is apparant that, when a similar provision was originally included in the 1971 Act, it was intended merely as a provision for the avoidance of doubt. It made clear that, while no agreement could void any provision of that Act, agency shop agreements made in accordance with the relevant provision should not be voided by the more general provisions of the Act relating to unfair dismissal, to which the right hon. Gentleman has just referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the purpose of section 140(2)(	<i>b</i>) has been clouded by successive alterations in drafting and by the omission of the repeal of paragraph 32(2)(	<i>a</i>) of schedule 1 to TULRA, which section 140(2) perceives and which is now repealed by paragraph 2 of schedule 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If everyone will keep calm for a moment, it all comes right in the end. The result is that there is now doubt about the correct construction of the legislation, and in at least one tribunal case it was found that an agreement could limit the right of an individual to have his case heard. Accordingly, I think that I can reassure the right hon. Gentleman if I say that, upon the advice of those who advise the Government on drafting matters, it is unnecessary in order to protect the operation of those provisions of the 1978 Act, as amended by the present Bill, relating to union membership agreements which limit the more general rights under the Act. The repeal is necessary, however, in order to avoid the possible conclusion that individuals offered protection in closed shops can be contracted out of their rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of concern that a union membership agreement concluded after the enactment of the Bill but without the requisite ballot majority may be voided in whole or in part by section 140(1), I should like to say this. To the extent that the agreement attempts to limit an individual's statutory rights against dismissal, or action short of dismissal, on grounds of non-membership of a union, this will be true However, this would also have been the case on the originally intended construction of section 140(2)(	<i>b</i>). The important point is that individuals whose statutory rights are infringed, whether or not in accordance with a union membership agreement have the right to claim com-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1442">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1753</span>
pensation at a tribunal. Section 140(1) merely removes doubt that this is so by voiding any agreement to the extent that it limits rights beyond the limitation imposed by sections 23 and 58, as amended. It does not go any further and, for example, in some way it creates some additional liability to or limitation upon litigation.

This is technical. There has been uncertainty created by excessive redrafting. Section 140(2)(	<i>b</i>) was intended to have the effect that in so far as section 23(4), to which the hon. Gentleman referred, limits the rights against unfair dismissal, or action short of dismissal, otherwise provided under the Act, no union membership agreement in compliance with these sections should be voided on those grounds. I know that this is difficult, but I hope that I have been able to confer some reassurance, and perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will now feel able to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not press the matter. I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman, the next time he visits some provincial town on his ministerial duties and stays overnight in some pleasant country hostelry, before turning out the light to reach out for the Gideon Bible that no doubt will be by the bedside and look at St. Luke, Chapter 11, verses 46–52. I commend them to him.

	<span class='label label-info column'>1754</span>
This amendment deals with continuity of employment during maternity absence. First, it corrects a minor anomaly in the present position. Paragraph 10 of schedule 13 of the 1978 Act should, strictly speaking, have referred to a return to work in accordance with section 45(1), not section 47, since the latter deals with the notification procedure for returning, not the actual right to return. We are taking the opportunity afforded by the Bill to correct this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, and much more importantly, the amendment is necessary to ensure statutory continuity of employment during maternity absence for those women who return to work not under the existing provisions—section 45(1)—but under the new provisions—section 56A(2) in clause 11, where they have accepted the offer of suitable alternative work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subject to further citations from the Holy Scriptures, Mr. Goodhew, I do not believe that the amendment need occasion any great contribution from the right hon. Gentleman or hon. Members opposite because these are necessary and entirely uncontroversial provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is a small, technical amendment made necessary by schedule 1 (7) which inserts paragraph (	<i>ff</i>) in section 127 (1) of the 1975 Act, that is to say, it adds the Employment Act 1980 to the list of Acts which may be extended offshore. This addition causes the reference in paragraph

The amendment removes specific reference to the Acts by paragraph numbers, and substitutes reference to any of the Acts mentioned above.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government feel that this is simpler and preferable to substituting a new reference (	<i>a</i>) to (	<i>ff</i>), since (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>c</i>) and (	<i>g</i>) have been overtaken by subsequent legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would not come amiss if at this stage I thanked you, Mr. Goodhew, and Mr. Leadbitter, for presiding over our proceedings. It has not been an unruly Committee, but it has been a very long one. I think that it has been a constructive and good-humoured Committee although fierce passions have been aroused. It is in respect of the constructiveness in the Committee and on the whole, the good humour of Committee members, that I should like to thank Opposition right hon. and hon. Members for the part that they have played in the proceedings. At the same time, I thank my hon. Friends for their forbearance during this Committee, in which they have had to sit still and keep relatively quiet for long periods which is a galling experience for any Member of Parliament. I thank them warmly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I want to thank enormously my hon. and learned Friend, the Under-Secretary, and to congratulate him on the way that he has piloted the Bill through a difficult Committee, and to say that the good humour, yet the knowledge and firmness that he has shown, augurs for him a prominent role in future Governments.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to join the Secretary of State in thanking you, Mr. Goodhew, and Mr. Leadbitter, for chairing our proceedings. Both of you have done so with great flexibility and skill, and with a good deal of forbearance, too. We deeply appreciate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to thank my right hon. and hon. Friends who have undertaken the bulk of the work for the Opposition. They have done magnificent work. On 17 December I said on Second Reading, that we should put the Bill under severe and unremitting scrutiny. We have done that, although we have not won many concessions. We are sorry that every time that we have tried to encourage Government hon. Members to join in our proceedings, they have not done so at any great length. I must agree with the right hon. Gentleman that they have shown remarkable tolerance. But I am sure that there will come a day when they will sit on this side of Standing Committees, and that they will probably give us some stick when we are on the Government Benches.
