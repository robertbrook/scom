	<br><blockquote><p>"or a place of work either of other workers who are parties to the trade dispute or occupied or used by any person who is giving or is likely to give aid or support to an employer party to the trade dispute whether by way of trade, business relationships, arrangements for insurance against loss, or in any other manner whatsoever directly or indirectly ".—[	<i>Mr. Harold Walker.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are considering at the same time the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 165, in page 13, line 41, at end insert—

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before resuming my speech, may I welcome my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General, who is here at the Committee's request in case there should be any points that remain unqualified from the intervention of my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General, or from my own observations. I believe that anything that was left uncertain—and there can be very little—has been cleared up by what we have said so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to resist the temptation that an adjournment offers to say it all again, but there are certain matters among the many raised, that I wish to deal with. I do not wish it to be thought that I am trying to evade any of the questions asked. If I take a few minutes longer, I hope that it will be regarded as helpful rather than tedious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) asked what the position would be in the case of a labour-only subcontracting firm sending in workers to the site at which a picket was employed. He asked whether it would be actionable to seek to persuade the firm not to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer is that, under clause 14, it would be unlawful if a picket at the premises of the labour-only sub-contracting firm—if he were not employed by the firm, and by definition he could not besought to persuade workers there to break their contracts of employment. That would be outside the immunity that clause 14 will retain. But if he seeks to picket at the place at which he is employed, he will benefit from the immunity under clause 14.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that this is not too much of a repetition of a point already made, but what would the position be if the shop steward from the firm in dispute drove to the firm supplying the labour and asked for a meeting with his colleagues there to let him know what was going on at the firm in dispute? If he asked his colleague to put it to the chaps at the next meeting and ask them what they thought, would that be picketing and, if so, would it be unlawful?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1265">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1419</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would certainly not be picketing, so the second part of the question would not arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question was also raised whether the CBI strike fund represented the same type of industrial action as is represented by picketing. That is a very different matter. Solidarity is not enough. The reason given to justify secondary picketing, away from the pickets' place of work, is that it is a demonstration of solidarity. But solidarity is not an excuse for interfering in all circumstances and to any extent in the individual rights of others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already sought to explain why, in the Government's opinion, separate considerations exist identifying or distinguishing secondary picketing from other industrial action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman than asked about the 	<i>TV Times,</i> because arrangements were made to print that elsewhere. He asked what would be the position of those who picketed at the new place of printing. The answer is that they would not be picketing at their place of work and would therefore not have immunity if they sought to induce breaches of contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, on that analogy, may I point out to the right hon. Gentleman how much tougher this legislation could be, were the Government minded to make it tougher. He may have seen in 	<i>The Times</i> today an account of a fine of about £14,000 levied upon the German trade union held to have been responsible for the industrial action which prevented 	<i>The Times</i> being printed in Germany. That was under legislation that obtained during the recent Socialist Government in Western Germany. It is worth bearing in mind that this is not 	<i>ultima Thule.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) asked various questions of fact. He may have been intervening in the speech of the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker), but these questions were asked. What would happen if someone picketed at the corporate head office? That would not come within clause 14 and there would be no immunity. What would happen if his place of work had shut and he picketed elsewhere? He would not then be picketing at his place of work. But is that likely to happen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The next question
	<span class='label label-info column'>1420</span>
about picketing at an associated company not a person's place of work. if he picketed on a big industrial estate, in one place or another, would he be entitled to immunity? The answer is "No": it must be at his own place of work. I was asked about BL at Long bridge or Crowley. He can picket at Corley with immunity if he works at Corley, but not at Long bridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have dealt with the questions that have been asked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman mentioned that the printer who went round the corner where his job had moved to and picketed his job would not have immunity. Knowing printers as I do, I know that they would still go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the hon. and learned Gentleman then consider the words of the editorial in 	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> of 13 February 1980:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What Mr. Prior's Bill would do would be to offer to employers the right to secure removal (eventually by incarceration if necessary) of peaceful pickets just so long as they were secondary. It is hard to believe that this would improve the climate of industrial relations. Indeed, it is hard to believe that it would not be liable to make them worse."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, despite the German analogy and German experience, to do in this country what he is suggesting he will do, according to the 	<i>The Daily Telegraph,</i> is liable to make industrial relations much worse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those who object to this method of dealing with what is acknowledged to be the problem of secondary picketing must volunteer alternative methods of dealing with it. The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is this. It would give the employer the opportunity to apply to the court for an injunction to restrain the pickets in the circumstances which he mentions from seeking to induce a breach of contract at the new place for printing. Whether they took that opportunity would be a matter solely for their discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But let those who complain volunteer an alternative that does not involve the use of criminal law. There is no means through the civil law by which, if one is to restrict one's response to secondary picketing, a completely watertight bulwark can be constructed. The civil law depends for its efficacy on being able to identify those upon whom the process of the court is to be served—the people to be made defendant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1266">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1421</span>
If objection is to be taken to the effects upon the rights of others that are inherent in secondary picketing, inducing breaches of contract, those who complain—they are entitled to do so—and find fault in the process envisaged in the clause and the Bill must explain how an alternative use of the civil law will produce a tighter bulkhead or say whether they are prepared, contrary to the view of the Government, to use the criminal law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I, first, join the hon. and learned Gentleman in welcoming the Solicitor-General? He will recall that we had many long hours considering the Employment Protection Bill, when we enjoyed the hon. and learned Gentleman's company. May I also remind the hon. and learned Gentleman the Under-Secretary that he has not dealt with the point that I raised about women picketing in solidarity with their sisters involved in an equal pay dispute?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister recognises that it is our duty to try to ascertain what the law will be so that we can advise our law-abiding—as he regularly recognises them to be trade union colleagues what it will be. I wish to ask him about a situation which, I am sure he will accept, is not hypothetical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take, for instance, the shipbuilding area of Tyneside, where the workers are all employed by British Shipbuilders. Let us suppose that the fitters employed in the various yards in Tyneside— it could equally well be the boilermakers, electricians or joiners—went on strike against British Shipbuilders because of some dispute. Let us suppose that the AUEW then organised picketing at the various shipyards that make up the Tyneside group of British Shipbuilders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would it be an offence for the fitters in Hawthorn Leslies Hepburn shipyard to join their colleagues on the Swan Hunter picket line, and vice versa? There are workers who cross the river to reach their place of employment, but it would be far easier—it is far easier—to organise the picket lines where the men work. Would the men be committing an offence under clause 14, given that they have the same employer at the different yards, if they picketed not at their own shipyard but at one of the shipyards across the river?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman uses the expression "committing an offence". I
	<span class='label label-info column'>1422</span>
do not suppose that he means that to be taken literally—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the context of clause 14.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes—in the context of clause 14. In other words, he is asking whether there would be immunity under the provisions of clause 14 for any tort involving inducing the breaking of a contract or threatening to break a contract which someone committed in those circumstances. The answer is that in such a case people would not be protected by the immunity that clause 14 retains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I explained before our adjournment the reasons why in the case of secondary picketing, as distinct from other secondary industrial action, the Government believe it right to make this special restriction. The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is "No". There would be no immunity in those circumstances because the men would not be at their own place of work, notwithstanding the fact that everybody on Tyneside may be employed by British Shipbuilders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the questions raised by the lion. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith). He asked whether clause 14 would effectively take away the possibility of last winter's scenes. The only answer to that question must be that it does not take away the possibility of such scenes, but it restores to those who are adversely affected by such picketing their common law rights. They may approach the court, say that their rights are being infringed and ask the court to make an order prohibiting the activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nobody can guarantee, by passing an Act of Parliament, that last winter's scenes—or, indeed, this winter's scenes—will not be repeated. But one can strengthen the hand of those who are harmed by that activity—I am glad to note that every member of the Committee has deplored it—by enabling them to go to the court and ask for an injunction restraining it, where at present an Act of Parliament prevents them from so doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rochdale feared that the reaction to the clause would be that it did not by itself go far enough. He wanted to know how it would be enforced. That enables me to answer the points about identification raised not only by the hon. Gentleman but by the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley), just before
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1267">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1423</span>
we adjourned, and by the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General dealt with this matter yesterday. I refer to col. 1355 of the 	<i>Official Report.</i> I do not think that I need repeat what he said. The essence of the matter is that if one restricts the means one employs to protect people's rights to the civil as distinct from the criminal law, one must be able to identify somebody to make a defendant. It is not right to say that one must always be able to identify every person picketing outside one's gates. It is enough—it has been proved to be enough, in many recent cases—to identify someone who is organising the operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will not be difficult, because in the great majority of cases, as my right hon. and learned Friend said, people are only too keen to advertise the fact that they are organising a picket, saying what the picket is about and saying that it is an official and effective picket. If it is not possible to identify who is organising the picket or to identify anyone who is on it, it is not likely to have very much influence upon the work force concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rochdale asked "What about enforcing it if it goes wrong. if people hold up two fingers to the order of the court?" We in this Committee agree that the consistent pattern, demonstrated not only in the Duport v. Sirs case most recently but also in the Vauxhall main dealers case which we discussed this morning, is for trade union members in this country to obey the orders of the High Court. We all here agree that that is desirable and right, and we do not suppose that that good example and tradition will be departed from.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, as my right hon. and learned Friend said to the hon. Member for Rochdale, it will be a rare occasion when this does not work and one must not say that one might as well not do it at all. That is a counsel of despair, particularly when no alternative is put forward. We must do something—I understood that to be common ground, in view of what the then Prime Minister said last year—and this is indeed readily enforceable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow entirely what my hon. and learned Friend says, but does he not agree that, when Parliament
	<span class='label label-info column'>1424</span>
legislates, it is concerned not with the 99 per cent. of the population who will obey the law but with the I per cent. who will flout it? I share the concern which was expressed by the hon Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) in this respect, that there will be a minority of cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1972, 1974, 1977, 1978, 1979 and 1980, there were scandalous situations which are not typical but which are nevertheless the subject of widespread public concern. Those are the situations in which the law will not be enforceable. That is why the hon. Member for Rochdale said what he did, and why I myself feel that this will not be enforceable in bad situations. We are not legislating for such situations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the instances that my hon. Friend takes 1974, 1976 and 1977—he should distinguish between circumstances in which the law is not enforced. When he talks of disgraceful scenes— I understand that he is referring to scenes of violence and disorder—those are questions of public order and, as such, I suggest they fall to be dealt with by the criminal law. We do not add to the efficacy of the criminal law by saying "It shall be an offence to commit an offence".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my right hon. and learned Friend said at our last sitting, this clause and the Bill do not in any real sense affect or change the criminal law. Therefore, it is not enough to point to those cases where public order was defied in the years to which my hon. Friend referred and say that that has a bearing on whether the provisions of this clause, which are not designed to affect the criminal law, can be enforced or will be effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we should remember that the provisions of this clause were not on the statute book when those disgraceful scenes took place. These provisions would have been beneficial, had they been on the statute book. Let us take a recent case. It would be possible to identify the organiser of the picket at Hadfields and take out an injunction—in those circumstances an injunction would probably have been granted—restraining that activity. With an order of the court issued, the pattern to which I have already referred can be expected to be repeated in future, and therefore the order will be complied with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, by being able to identify and restrain the organiser of the crowds of people who attend and create the scenes of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1268">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1425</span>
disorder to which my hon. Friend referred, by being able to proceed and identify that person and obtain a High Court order against him, we are adding to the armoury of the employer and, indeed, of the workers, whose rights and interests we are determined to protect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a question on the point that the hon. and learned Gentleman has just made. He talks of the organiser of the picket being identified. Whether it is the organiser or someone else who is identified and made the subject of proceedings, will it not be the duty of the employer or whoever is uing that person—presumably the employer—to prove that he individually, as Mr. X—not as the general secretary of one of the trade unions and so on but he personally—tried to induce a breach of contract?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a matter of saying "He was there among 200 other people and therefore he must have been personally involved in this inducement." When an individual is being sued, surely there is an onus on the plaintiff to prove the case. The same degree of proof is not required as for a criminal case, but must there not be a hefty onus on the plaintiff?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is perfectly right. On the balance of the probabilities, he has to establish that the person who he says is organising the picket is in fact doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Personally attempting to induce a breach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. First, it has to be shown that the picket has the purpose of inducing breaches of contract and is actually carrying out that purpose. Then one goes to the person organising the picket and says "This is happening because you are organising it". Certainly, one has the burden of proving that on the balance of the probabilities, but, as I have said, those organising these pickets are generally only too anxious to claim credit for the fact that they are doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Sirs did not deny that he was organising the industrial action against Duport Steels a few months ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am sorry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1426</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is on that point, I shall give way but I must keep an eye on the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. and learned Gentleman has said about the organisers of pickets is quite true. They are not slow to advertise that they organise pickets. But that is because the law now does not allow action to be taken against them. But, if the law is changed, that changes the situation of people who now advertise that they are the organisers. Instead of advertising the fact, that would be the last thing they would do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is impossible to identify who is organising a picket, it is unlikely that such an anonymous and unofficial picket would have much influence upon the work force. But we shall have to see. As my right hon. and learned Friend said on Tuesday, there is no limit to the ingenuity of pickets or to that of employers who are affected by picketing and who have to defend themselves. We must do the best we can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I thought that the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) eloquently demonstrated that section 15 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act confers no immunity for picketing at present. He gave the illustration of six people standing quietly at an entrance when a police officer arrested one of them for picketing. It would be deplorable if there were discrimination on the basis that he put forward. However, section 15 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act gave no protection against the criminal offence of obstruction and therefore to restrict the immunity will not have any effect on the criminal law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher) asked me what purpose the Attorney-General had in mind when he said that the purpose of the clause was to restore to employers the rights that they had. He asked what rights they were and what statutes there were. Their rights are their rights at common law—not to have the contracts with their own workpeople broken, not to have someone saying "Break the contract you have with your boss". That is a right which the common law gives, and it is a right which the clause will restore to them in certain circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1427</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. and learned Gentleman will know, they have never had these rights in this context. So how can they be restored to them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must respectfully disagree with the hon. Gentleman because, until Parliament intervened with one statute or another the most recent of which was the Trade Union and Labour Relations Amendment Act 1976—they had rights at common law. Not only employers but everyone had those rights. No one has to put up with his contracts being deliberately sought to be broken. If the hon. Gentleman will accept</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that why they have not exercised them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In many cases they have. The first reported case was in about 1850 when an opera singer was lured away from her contract with an opera house. Those rights have therefore been exercised. It is an interesting case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to some better founded points in the speech of the right hon. Member for Chesterfield. He said that there were three issues to consider. First, why do the Government want to confine picketing to the workplace? I spent some time before lunch explaining that, and I shall not weary the Committee by repeating it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, the right hon. Gentleman said that the provision attacked the right of trade unionists to exploit solidarity. To that t must reply that solidarity, like patriotism, is not enough. One can justify anything by saying that it demonstrates solidarity. But what we must consider is the effect of solidarity upon other people's rights and then inquire whether that represents a just situation. For the reasons that I have given, we believe that here it does not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Third, the right hon. Gentleman asked who would have responsibility for monitoring this, as he put it. It will rest entirely with employers, having been given back the rights that they always had under the common law, whether they wish to use them or not, But the right hon. Gentleman sought support from the Donovan report, when he quoted from paragraph 856, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the atmosphere engendered by a strike, however, men who are enduring the privations which may accompany it would hardly be human if they viewed with composure the spectacle of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1428</span>
other workmen endeavouring to take over their jobs or the apparent uninterrupted flow of custom to their employer."</p></blockquote>
I entirely agree with that. One does not expect them to view it with composure, but nor, in my belief and in that of the Government, are we right in permitting them to picket at places other than their own place of work. The paragraph goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The law therefore has had to deal with the problems that picketing may sometimes go beyond mere attempts at peaceful persuasion and erupt into a variety of forms of intimidation in violation of the rights of others."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will listen to that particular point. I know that this is a long speech and that he has a lot to do, but I am referring to the extract from Donovan that he did not complete, and I have now completed it for him. It is because of that point, which was identified by Donovan, that we wish to restrict picketing to someone's own place of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At paragraph 876, the report states that four members, including Lord Donovan himself, considered that picketing at someone's home
	<br><blockquote><p>"is quite unnecessary: information can be peaceably communicated or sought by post. The liberty to picket a person's home involves the risk of threats to his family which are quite unjustifiable, and may cause much distress. No doubt '—</p></blockquote>
this is the important part—
	<br><blockquote><p>"such threats are a breach of the law, but the victims are unlikely in most cases to bring proceedings. Section 2 should therefore be amended".</p></blockquote>
Indeed it was in the 1971 Act, and has been left so amended by the previous Labour Government's subsequent legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Donovan Commission therefore recognises in those two paragraphs or, at any rate, its leading members recognise—that, notwithstanding the criminal law, picketing may erupt into violence and threats of violence. For that reason—hon. Gentlemen may say that it is not logical—we believe that, for historical and other reasons, it is permissible to leave picketing at the place of work but that it should not be permissible elsewhere in the sense that the immunity at present given by the Act should be restricted to own place of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore come back, at long last, to the amendments. The purpose of all of them is to widen the immunity of picketing elsewhere than at the pickets' place of work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Women?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not say that the hon. Gentleman has women on the brain, but he has asked about women, and I have said that I would deal with it. He asked me what is to happen if women employees picket their employer in furtherance of a trade dispute, and other women come along and show solidarity for the cause of women's lib.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Equal pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Equal pay—very well, that is a trade dispute. The other women do not mind about the trade dispute, but they mind about women's lib, non-discrimination and all the rest of it. I speak in the presence of the learned Solicitor-General, and subject to what he may wish to say if I am wrong, but my answer is that so long as they take no part in persuading anybody to break his or her contract of employment they will not commit a tort and will have no need to claim immunity. They will, therefore, not be affected by the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the purpose of all the amendments to widen, almost to its present extent, the immunity that will be given to pickets picketing elsewhere than at their own place of work from penalty for the tortuous act of inducing people to break or threaten to break their contracts. For that reason, we feel unable to accept any of the amendments, and I must, therefore, advise my right hon. and hon. Friends to resist each of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) rises to destroy once again the right hon. and learned Gentleman's case, I wish to address one question to the Secretary of State, now that we have the benefit of his presence. It relates to a matter that I raised in the Committee this morning, and which was also touched on by one or two of my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were discussing ways in which tension on picket lines was likely to be heightened by these proposals. I referred also to the prospect of deeming, which is now, it seems, very much in the news, and to the probability that, if that proposal went through, it would add to the difficulties on the picket lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to 	<i>The Daily Telegraph's</i> story this morning, which I am sure the Secretary of State will have seen, or will have had
	<span class='label label-info column'>1430</span>
drawn to his attention. It suggests that those who support his views on trade union reform, as 	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> describes it, are fearful that if the proposal about curbing social security payments to strikers' families is passed it will, as it is put, undermine the Government's chances of making their trade union legislation stick. The story contains a particular reference to picketing, and I suspect that, when we read about the Secretary of State's supporters, we could for "supporters" substitute "the Secretary of State", and this is another of the inspired leaks about which we read so much these days in industrial relations matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the question because I think that it would be helpful to the Committee to know whether the Secretary of State is in favour of the deeming proposal which is about to drop upon us. It seems to have a direct bearing on picketing, so I wonder whether he could help the Committee in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. James Prior)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an extraordinarily ingenious way of trying to draw me out on a subject which I feel has no relevance to the picketing proposals at all. I might almost say that just because 	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> thinks that it has relevance, that does not mean that the hon. Gentleman ought to think so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a full, if rather less than satisfactory, reply from the hon. and learned Gentleman. I do not think that we can allow all that he has said to pass without comment. Nor can I fail to remind him of some conspicuous omissions from what he has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to detain the Committee for long. However, because the hon. and learned Gentleman chose to open his speech this morning by claiming that the Government were acting as they were because they had a mandate for the proposals in their manifesto, I cannot resist reminding him that the Government were elected with the votes of about one-third of those entitled to vote. It seems to me and, I am sure, to my hon. Friends, that the Government are imposing a much more stringent test for unions to obtain power through a union membership agreement than they seem to think suitable for a political party to obtain the power of Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the logic of what the hon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1271">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1431</span>
and learned Gentleman said, and recognising that public opinion is a force that ought not to be ignored, perhaps the Government ought not to ignore the fact that, as I understand it, a Gallup Poll showed this morning that the Labour Party has a 12 per cent. lead over the Conservative Party. Perhaps, in the light of that, the Government may like to reflect on whether we or they have it right, and who are in step with the electorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I am talking about steps, may I mention that there has been reference—or perhaps it came up in the Select Committee—to a quotation from a newspaper about how the Government were proceeding step by step. I cannot help wondering at what step we reach the proposal put forward by the Member for Paddington (Mr. Wheeler), who was reported in the 	<i>Sheffield Morning Telegraph</i> a few days ago as:
	<br><blockquote><p>"urging that trade unionists found guilty of offences connected with picketing be prohibited from attending further demonstrations, under pain of imprisonment."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Transport them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am even further surprised to learn that the hon. Gentleman is a former Home Office crime researcher. think that that throws some light on Home Office policy in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the Secretary of State and the Attorney-General before him, the hon. and learned Gentleman brushed aside our arguments about the interrelationship between clause 14 and the working paper of 19 February. Although I sought, in moving amendment No. 163, to confine my arguments to the scope of this group of amendments, none the less it seemed appropriate—indeed, essential—that we should consider the amendments in the context not only of the clause and the Bill but also of the new working paper, because the working paper proposes significantly and fundamentally to amend section 13 of the 1974 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill and the clause we are discussing are linked to the provisions of section 13 of that Act. We are entitled to know whether the proposals we are talking about here will relate to the existing section 13 or an entirely different section 13. That question is fundamental to the Bill and to our amendments. I can only assume that the Government have chosen to ignore it
	<span class='label label-info column'>1432</span>
today because it is not convenient to their defence of their present proposals or—rather more likely, perhaps—because they do not know the answers, or because it reveals what a mess the whole legislation is becoming. I suspect they are influenced by a mixture of all three considerations, but probably mainly the last.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can give an example of the mess we are getting into here. I refer to the point, a perfectly fair point, raised more than once by my hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Evans), who has profound experience of industrial relations. I am bound to say that, sitting by sitting, the conviction has been growing on us that hardly any Conservative Member has any personal direct experience of industrial relations or the reality of what happens in a strike. What I have heard today has confirmed me in the belief that they know little of the realities of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to what the Attorney-General said on Tuesday. My hon Friend the Member for Newton had asked the following question. If work is moved from one shipyard to another, and the workers at the shipyard now faced with closure—its berths are empty and there is nothing there—go down the road and protest to the lads at the other shipyard that they have been put out of work because of the transfer of work, what would happen under the Bill? The Attorney-General said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I shall do everything I can to assist the hon. Gentleman. For those in the empty yard to go to the yard to which the ships have been moved and tell their friends that the ships have been moved because of an industrial dispute would not give the employer any right at all. But if they then said Look, these ships are blacked, come out and support us ', it would give the employer a right, if he wanted, to take proceedings against them under clause 14."</p></blockquote>
He added:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But it does not create any criminal offence."</p></blockquote>
Then he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But if the other workers were inducing his own men "—</p></blockquote>
the employees of the second employer—
	<br><blockquote><p>"effectively to break their contract of employment, and he felt that that would be very damaging to them and to the contract, it would be entirely up to him to decide whether to go to the courts to seek an injunction."</p></blockquote>
Just before that he had said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If two or three well respected trade union members were doing what he would expect them to do, and his own men listened and then said No, we have these ships in our yard and we want to go
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1272">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1433</span>
on working … "—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 18 March 1980; cc. 1349-–50.]</p></blockquote>
It seems that the Attorney-General is distinguishing between peacefully communicating and peacefully persuading someone to take action. How on earth can the employer have knowledge of the dialogue between those parties?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all right to say to them "Look, you have got our work". But if they say "Look, you have got our work. Stop doing it, or else", it becomes actionable under clause 14. That is what we have been told, and it is extraordinary. The Attorney-General says that when that happens the employer can go off and seek an injunction. But by the time he does that it will be too late, because what has been said has been said. If the chaps at the second yard decide that they will pull out, will an offence have been committed, because they have responded to the invitation? They may not have been coerced, but they have done it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State's remarks about the "Nawala" case and dockers were extraordinarily interesting, and will doubtless be read with fascination by the officers of the International Transport Workers Federation. I described the situation on the MV "Nawala". It had been employing a Norwegian crew, at European rates of pay, had sacked them in Hamburg, flown over a Chinese crew from Hong Kong who could not speak a word of English, and put them on board. Because the International Transport Workers Federation saw that as the exploitation of cheap labour—something that we do not tolerate in this country, because we have our wages council system—when the vessel came in with a load of iron ore for British Steel at Red car, it said to the dockers "Black this vessel". The dockers blacked it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the Secretary of State what would then happen under the proposals in his working paper. It seemed to me that, because the dockers who had blacked the vessel were not employees of the employers in dispute, and because the refusal to unload the vessel would break the contract to deliver iron ore to British Steel, there would have been an inducement to breach a commercial contract, which would be actionable. The Secretary of State said that the dockers
	<br><blockquote><p>"would be first customers or buyers, whichever way one likes to look at it, of the ship that is the cause of the dispute or blacking. Paragraph 18 of the working paper makes it clear that, in our proposals, they would also be covered by immunity."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1434</span>
He then said, brushing the whole thing aside,
	<br><blockquote><p>"I do not want to pursue this too far, because it does not have much relevance, and this is only a consultative document. But, taking the right hon. Gentleman's point, there is no doubt that, as the consultative document is at present composed, in the case of the 'Nawala' the dockers who blacked it would be in the position of first suppliers and would enjoy immunity. "—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 18 March 1980; c. 1317.]</p></blockquote>
If that really is the case, no one would be happier than I. But—the Solicitor-General may like to comment upon this—it strikes me as very odd that those dockers who are providing a service, loading or unloading a vessel, can be regarded as suppliers or customers. If that is so, it is a further dimension that will have to be considered by those who are being consulted during the working paper's progress towards statute form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until the hon. and learned Gentleman moved towards the end of his speech, we had not replies to our arguments—some extremely powerful arguments were deployed in support of our amendments—but vague generalisations of a Second Reading character in which the Government sought to take refuge rather than a reply appropriate to Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me look at one or two of the comments that Ministers have made. For example, the hon. and learned Gentleman posed his own hypothesis: is primary picketing affected? He echoed the Secretary of State on Second Reading, saying "No". The Secretary of State was quite categorical on Second Reading. Is it as simple as that,?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When it has helped his case, the Minister, like some of us on the Opposition side when it has helped ours, has taken advantage of the highly informative, well researched and authoritative 	<i>Legal Information Bulletin</i> of the Industrial Relations Service. What does it say about this? It poses the same question:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Is primary picketing affected by the Bill?"</p></blockquote>
It goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Prior claimed during the Second Reading that: 'The existing right of someone to picket his own place of work is unaffected'. Whether this will be the case remains to be seen. … The new statutory nexus between lawful picketing and immunity from tort liability, however, means that it will now be possible to seek an injunction not against criminal behaviour such as nuisance but against inducing breach of contract where the picketing goes beyond the bounds of the statute. In other words, even where the picket is by an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1273">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1435</span>
employee at his place of work, if it consists of acts which fall outside the scope of attendance, it is no longer protected."</p></blockquote>
Equally, I am not at all sure about the reply given by the Attorney-General about the effect of the code of practice on criminal law. But that is something which we shall have to be prepared to study a little further, perhaps with people who are a liftle more versed in the law than most of us on the Opposition side, with the exception, I hasten to add, of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson), who will doubtless provide us with some more good guidance on these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was astonished by the cavalier way in which my hon. and learned Friend's argument about the apportionment of damages was swept aside. The 	<i>Legal Information Bulletin</i> of the Industrial Relations Service to which I have just referred takes a much more serious view of the matter than the Under-Secretary. Its comment begins:
	<br><blockquote><p>"since in many circumstances a picket might be part lawful and part unlawful "—.</p></blockquote>
That is exactly the situation described by my hon. and learned Friend. There are the blokes at head office picketing the head office because they work there; and there are the blokes from the branch office which is being shut down coming along to give a bit of support. Presumably, the first lot are lawful and the second lot unlawful. The Industrial Relations Service describes it in this way:
	<br><blockquote><p>"since in many circumstances a picket might be part lawful and part unlawful fie if others joined a lawful picket), the problems that would face a court in calculating and apportioning damages are mind-boggling".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is even more complicated than that. The lawful picket, because of actions by the unlawful picket, may himself at some stage become an unlawful picket. So that is an extra dimension to the difficulties which the court will have to disentangle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Metaphors such as "minefield" and "quagmire" have been bandied about. All of them are relevant, but we need to find some new metaphor to describe the enormous mess that we are getting into here—ordure pit or something like that. Some of my hon. Friends with the colourful vocabulary that they have
	<span class='label label-info column'>1436</span>
acquired in their industrial experience outside the Committee may perhaps help with some appropriate metaphor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to pursue all the omissions and all the points. I share the anxiety to make progress which I sense in the Committee, but I cannot sit down without saying this. To attack us, as the hon. and learned Gentleman did, for defending the right of people peacefully to persuade and communicate is extraordinary and ridiculous. We have heard the hon. and learned Gentleman echo the Secretary of State in suggesting that the Government were merely seeking to tackle those who in their opinion, by implication, had abused the right to picket, those who had indulged in extravagant and disagreeable behaviour. Certainly, disagreeable behaviour has been seen in industry in recent years, but the suggestion that it is a new phenomenon can only spring from people who have little knowledge of the history of these things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Look at what Jim Callaghan said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, the right hon. Gentleman wants to quote what my right hon Friend, then Prime Minister, said. I entirely agreed with my right hon. Friend Certainly, some things were going on at the time that none of us ought to be prepared to condone, and he was right to be critical. But the right hon. Gentleman seems not to understand that my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition was not saying that those abuses could be cured by changing the law or by bringing in new laws.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Giles Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is because they were covered by the law in many cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. This is what the police have said repeatedly—that the existing law is adequate to deal with that kind of situation. So changing the law will not change that behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the right hon. Gentleman of the words of John Hare to the Conservative Party conference in 1961, when to those who thought that all these problems could be remedied by passing Acts of Parliament he said "Acts of Parliament seldom make men good". That is what we are talking about—human behaviour. We are all against sin, but does anybody really believe that we can stop it by passing an Act of Parliament? That is the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1274">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1437</span>
daftness of the right hon. Gentleman's approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend make clear to the Government Benches, and particularly to the Secretary of State, that when our right hon. Friend who was then the Prime Minister made that statement in January and expressed the feelings of most of us in the Parliamentary Labour Party, he did not demand that the Cabinet bring out legislation of this nature. He went to the TUC and had discussions with it, which resulted in a voluntary code to put the matter right—far from the tactics of the Government who are introducing diabolical legislation of this nature which will only cause further problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely right. That was the beneficial consequence. I know that hon. Gentlemen on the Government Front Bench will sneer and pour cold water on the TUC's efforts in this respect, but do they really believe that they will achieve more by passing laws than the TUC, when the TUC was seeking by voluntary means to influence its members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Needham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear "Yes". I can only suggest that that "Yes" came from the depths of profound and abysmal ignorance of the reality of industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In case there is any doubt about the TUC's view, let me quote from the letter that it sent to the Secretary of State on the very day that he published his working paper on secondary action, 19 February. The general secretary of the TUC said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"May I say at the outset that we have always advised affiliated unions to act within the existing law regarding picketing and have never condoned breaches of the law: as you w ill know, instructions and guidance have been issued in the recent dispute by the unions concerned."</p></blockquote>
I think that he was talking about the steel dispute. I shall not quote the whole letter unless pressed to do so by the Committee, as I do not want to be accused of making selective quotations. [	<i>Hon. Members:</i> 'Go on."] If the hon. and learned Gentleman wants the whole of it, he can have the whole of it. Otherwise, I shall be accused of quoting selectively to reinforce my own case. The letter went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As you also well know, the TUC has been active over many weeks in trying to help to obtain a settlement of the dispute in conjunction with the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1438</span>
unions concerned and with ACAS. In contrast, there has been no effort by the Government to help, and now feelings are understandably running high. The strike is now entering its eighth week "—</p></blockquote>
that was in mid-February—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and there appears to be no immediate prospect of a breakthrough. Indeed, the strike about pay could merge into a wider dispute about closures of plants with very serious implications for parts of the country like South Wales. The Government by its policy of rigid cash limits and studied inactivity must bear the major responsibility for this.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"You refer to the TUC guides. I must remind you that these guides followed an agreement with the previous Government on the best ways of tackling the immense economic and industrial problems faced by the country. In that statement, it was agreed that legalistic intervention in the conduct of industrial disputes is harmful, and that the best approach lay in the issue by the TUC of advice and guidance on a range of matters including picketing.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Since the Conservative Government took office, our General Council have demonstrated their readiness to take part in discussions which could lead the way to an agreed approach to tackling current problems facing the nation. We have also offered to engage in talks about improving industrial relations provided that the Government did not proceed with its damaging and disruptive proposals on industrial relations legislation. These offers have not been accepted and the Government has instead pressed on with its doctrinaire approach. Moreover, when we discussed the Employment Bill with you we specifically warned you that, if the Government proceeded with this legislation and its other divisive policies, it would create a climate which would increase industrial tensions and make it much more difficult to contain and resolve disputes.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Today you have issued yet another highly dangerous set of proposals to curb workers' rights and trade union safeguards. This unfortunately makes the chances of fruitful co-operation between the TUC and the Government more remote.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are still willing to discuss with you how employers, unions and the Government can improve industrial relations, but there can be little prospect of such talks succeeding while the Government refuses to moderate its approach on a range of issues including industrial relations law.</p></blockquote>

I had no intention of even referring to that letter until provoked into doing so by hon. Members on the Government Benches, who, in turn, virtually demanded that I read out the whole of the letter. I had no option, Mr. Leadbitter. The letter makes the point more strongly that I myself could, that at a time when any Government need the goodwill, the co-operation, the support of the trade union movement and the millions of workers that it represents, this Government are doing whatever they can to alienate it. That is not only folly but is immensely harmful to industrial relations and to the interests of the country.

Those who believe that the disagreeable events that have taken place in recent times are a new phenomenon should read their history. My father, who for many years was a journeyman felt hat maker, was also a member of the appropriate trade union. I remember visiting his union office and seeing on the wall a picture of a tramcar that had been overturned in the Lancashire town of Denton in 1913 by those who were outraged by blacklegs going to work at a firm in dispute. A tram was overturned. I wonder what would be said by the media if that happened today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can go back even further than that to the Sheffield outrages in 1866 or thereabouts. If I recall my history correctly, the event that prompted the setting up of a Royal Commission was the dropping of explosives down the chimney of the home of a blackleg. That was evil and wicked, and none of us would ever dream of condoning that kind of behaviour. But that was the way in which these matters were handled 100 years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More recently, in Nottinghamshire, I understand, in the wake of the general strike a union known as the Spencer Union—my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) will know more about it than I—encouraged some of its members to engage in blacklegging activities. Vehicles were overturned.

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we come to the next group of amendments, I should like to do a spot of picketing myself. I have been looking at the wording of the Bill, and so, for the purpose of peacefully obtaining information and communicating information, I wish peacefully to persuade the Committee that since the first group of amendments has taken some seven hours, giving right hon. and hon. Members the fullest opportunity to discuss the principles of the clause, on the next and following</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1440</span>
	<p>defending the rights of ordinary decent, well behaved workers peacefully to communicate that somehow we were completely ignoring, being indifferent to or were condoning some of what the proposals in clause 14 are directed at.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) said that when we pass laws in Parliament we are not aiming those laws at the 99 per cent. of the population who are law-abiding citizens but at the I per cent. of lawbreakers. We shall not argue about percentages. In seeking to legislate against that tiny percentage of people whose behaviour is unacceptable to them and to us they are stripping every worker of certain rights.</p>
	<p>Our amendments are directed at that—saying that those who want to behave in accordance with the law and merely seek peacefully to communicate and persuade should have the right to do so. That is what is being denied them by the clause. That is what we seek to offset and mitigate by our amendments.</p>
	<p>I think that those amendments have been treated in a cavalier, brusque and indifferent fashion, and I urge my hon. Friends to divide the Committee.</p>
	<p>5.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 9, Noes 12.</p>
	<p>groups of amendments we might perhaps try to address ourselves to the terms of the amendments.</p>
	<p>The Committee will note that I am not wholly obstructing, because I have used the word "try". I apologise to the Attorney-General—I have read his speech at our last sitting and I hope that the Committee and he are happy that I have managed to do it standing still.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 194, in page 13, line 39, after "union", insert "employed by the union".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>No. 166, in clause 14, page 13, line 41, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"or is an official so attending at the request either of his trade union or of such a member".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great relief, for me at any rate, to have contrived a brief escape from purdah in order to present this amendment. It is an amendment which I can best describe in words with which my hon. and learned Friend has made the Committee familiar over the past few weeks—limited but useful. It does not alter the purpose of the clause. It is not designed to alter its objectives in any way. The purpose is to make more secure and more certain its intention of providing organisations and firms with an effective remedy against picketing by people who are neither their employees nor professional officers of unions representing those employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording of the clause, surely, leaves a loophole. The 1974 Act gives a very broad definition of the term "union official"—it means anyone "elected or appointed" to a union office
	<br><blockquote><p>"in accordance with the rules of the union".</p></blockquote>
That is sufficiently broad for union members working elsewhere to join a picket line. That, I believe, creates far too much uncertainty and offers far more scope for argument than is consistent with the clear and effective application of this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, from those brief words, my hon. and learned Friend will accept that there is a loophole. It is a loophole that should be closed before this Bill is enacted. It can best be closed by confining the term "official" to those who are actually employed by the union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a momentary flash of optimism when I tabled the amendment, I hoped that right hon. and hon. Members opposite would not oppose it. I suppose that that was a forlorn hope, and it was extinguished by the debate that we have had so far. But it was based on the fact that more than one Opposition Member had urged that employers and employees and their proper trade union representatives should be left alone without outside interference to settle their own disputes. That is what this amendment—and, indeed, the whole clause—seeks to achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1442</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 164 and 166. I think that we would all agree that at present the law on picketing is limited, and that, for it to be peaceful and beneficial to the community, we rely very much on the good sense of policemen and pickets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this context, the union official—I think that the definition is adequate at the moment and I do not want to limit it in the way suggested by the hon. Member—is absolutely key. I can quote in evidence for that the chief constables of the West Midlands, South Wales and South Yorkshire who came before the Select Committee. They said not only, as has already been mentioned, that the picketing law was adequate, although people need to understand it better, but that the key factor was the relationship between the police and pickets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The officials are important here. The TUC guidelines that have been referred to a number of times in the last two or three days have this to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It will help to ensure that picketing is peaceful if an experienced member, preferably a union official, is in charge of the picket line. He should have a letter of authority which he can if necessary show to police officers or to workers attempting to cross the picket line. He should ensure that the number of pickets is no larger than is necessary."</p></blockquote>
The guidelines go on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It should be made clear to any person who joins a picket line that he or she must accept instructions from the person who is in charge of the picket line and undertake to behave in a lawful and disciplined manner".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, the official is key, and the TUC guidelines recognise that. I suspect that when the right hon. Gentleman writes his own code of practice he will say exactly the same—that the official is a very important person if people are to picket peacefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me put the role of the official into the context of clause 14. I think that officials will become even more important in sorting out the problems that will be caused by this clause. Hon. Members are already well aware of our views on its principles, but the clause raises difficult questions about the definition of unlawful secondary picketing. These are questions which, again, it will need officials to sort out—whether one is unlawful if one pickets a head office, whether it is one's administrative centre or not, whether picketing an associate firm is legal or not legal and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1277">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1443</span>
As hon. Members opposite keep saying, trade unionists are law-abiding and will want to know what they can and cannot do. They will want to know whether they are allowed to picket in sympathy or whether they can picket suppliers and customers. The hon. and learned Gentleman will immediately say " No "—but trade unionists may not know and will need an official to tell them. Therefore, as I say, the role of the official is key.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus clause 14, if it becomes section 14, will throw an immense burden and responsibility upon the official. If added to that are the problems of the working paper—which the hon. and learned Gentleman has tended to slide over—and matters such as how one defines " capability", how to decide on motive, whether one's picketing is predominantly in furtherance of a particular dispute or whether it is for some extraneous motive, and so on—again the officials will have to give advice on all these complex questions, so that a considerable burden will be thrown on to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is the problem of criminality. The Attorney-General has assured us that the criminal law will in no way be affected—that it will not come in any more under the new provisions in clause 14—though I rather doubt that. Again, we shall need the official to help sort out such problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 14 states that the official will be allowed to the picket line only if he is accompanying a member of his union. What happens if that member goes away? Does the official become an unlawful picket? Such questions immediately raised by the wording of subsection 1(b) of the new section 15.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 164 seeks to clarify the issue, while the purpose of amendment No. 166 is to deal with cases in which members may not want their officials on the picket line. I think that hon. Members on the Government Benches will be the first to say that they want officials to have responsibility, and to be able to go on to the picket line. Our amendments are designed to ensure that more sense is made of the role of the official than is already made in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are against the principle of clause 14.1 hope that nothing that I have said is taken to undermine that. To refer back to the earlier debate, we do not think that the clause is justified by the general arguments about intimidation. They are either arguments against all
	<span class='label label-info column'>1444</span>
picketing, which I think the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) might support, or they are arguments about actions which are criminal already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor do I think the clause is justified by reference to the rights of other employees, particularly in view of its restrictive nature. It will be unlawful to picket head office, associate companies, the first supplier or customer or any suppliers or customers, or to picket sympathetically. That is very restrictive, going far beyond what could be justified by the events of last winter, which were a matter either for the criminal law or for the code of practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman has admitted that his own case is illogical. Probably because it is illogical, it throws him open to attacks to which I know he will be subjected from the hon. Member for Hendon, North and his friends, who will say "If you believe that picketing is unjustified and always leads to intimidation, why do you not act against all picketing?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that clause 14 is highly restrictive, that it is basically anti-union and that it will probably be unworkable. Certainly, it is the most offensive clause in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I correct the hon. Gentleman in one respect? I made clear on Second Reading that I am not against picketing. I have said so at least twice in this Committee, and I shall return to it on a later amendment. I am in favour of picketing as a right, just as I am in favour of the right to withdraw one's labour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had finished, but I am pleased to hear that the hon. Member for Hendon, North is in favour of the right. I shall be interested to hear, then, in what way he disagrees with the hon. and learned Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take only a minute, but I cannot allow amendment No. 194 to go by without some comment. We have not yet heard whether the Government propose to accept or reject it, but l shall be very surprised if they intend to accept an amendment which so drastically alters the meaning of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I rise merely to stress the wide nature of the change proposed. I have no figures in front of me, but I am sure that at least 95 per cent. of trade union officials would be affected by it.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members do not always understand the voluntary nature of the trade union movement. The movement is run, essentially, by unpaid officers who are not in any sense employed by the union but who do the job on a voluntary basis. They would all be made ineligible to picket away from their own place of work if this amendment were passed. That would be a basic change in the effect of the clause. I hope that the Government do not propose to accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Chesterle-Street (Mr. Radice) has rightly pointed out the need for responsible officers of the union to be present on picket lines to give advice to members, many of whom may be very inexperienced in trade union matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the hon. Gentleman is a member of the Transport & General Workers Union. I should be interested to know, if he has the figures in his head, how many members of the union hold office—both paid and unpaid? Could he give us some rough guidance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I had had some notice it would have been easy to find out, but cannot give such information off the top of my head. However, in region 9, which basically covers Yorkshire, there are about 60,000 members. Without wishing to be quoted, I would guess that there are certainly no more than 10 full-time officers. The rest of the union organisation is done on a voluntary basis by the branch secretaries, the branch chairmen, the branch treasurers and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those people can play a helpful part—I stress the word "helpful"—in a dispute. They do not only give advice in the way that my hon. Friend the Member for Chester-le-Street described. They are sometimes also able to cool tempers when excitement is beginning to rise. If there is a lorry driver in the gateway and the men are not quite sure whether he is to go in or not, very often it is the lay officer—perhaps the branch chairman or the branch secretary—who is able to say "Cool it down, lads. We do not want any trouble. The police are across the road. We shall talk to this man, but if he insists on going in, he is going in." It is usually a branch officer who plays that role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The occasion often arises when a branch officer is needed to go from one picket line to another to do such jobs. He will not
	<span class='label label-info column'>1446</span>
always be at the gate of his place of work; he cannot always be at his own place of work. It would be a grave error to make it impossible for those lay officers of the union to do that work. It is extremely valuable. Very often, it is important in the matter of keeping the peace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to underline what my hon. Friend has said. In my own industry we have to picket only very rarely, but there have been a few occasions when we have done so. On one occasion I was asked by my union to organise a picket when I was not a fully-employed official of the union. I am referring back to the example I gave before, when there was a dispute on a publication—it was the 	<i>TV Times—and</i> the employer moved his publication somewhere else. He moved it to Maidstone. I was asked to go down to see what was going on and, if necessary, place a picket. I collected 10 colleagues and went down there. Perhaps I may mention this true story, in view of what has been said about there often being good relations between the police and the pickets and that much depends upon the good sense of the pickets and the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found that some obscure printer was printing the magazine. I arranged a picket. I remember the first man who came along. It was the first time that I had, as a picket, spoken to someone trying to cross a picket line. I assure the Committee that I was the epitome of peacefulness. I asked the gentleman where he was going. He said that he was going into the works. I asked him whether he knew that there was an industrial dispute. He said "No. I have just come out of prison"—there was a prison in Maidstone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The employer was recruiting his blackleg, non-union labour straight from prison. I explained the circumstances and the individual concerned then decided not to go to work. He joined us on the picket line. I suppose that he would now be described as a secondary picket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The police came along. There were about 10 of us and about two dozen policemen. We immediately established good relations with the police. I remember in particular an inspector who was an especially jovial character. I became, I thought, very friendly with him. We arranged for tea and sandwiches. Being decent, honest and reasonable British printers, we shared our tea with the police and, in particular, the inspector, who was very grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1279">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1447</span>
We seemed to get on well, until late at night. All of a sudden, two policemen literally jumped on each picket, and one got hold of the right arm and one got hold of the left arm. We were then pinioned by the lads in blue serge. The gates opened, there was a great revving up of engines, and a lorry full of copies of the 	<i>TV Times</i> roared out. The gates were then shut and our arms were unpainted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was my first experience of picketing and of the police. When we next brewed our tea, the inspector was not given a cup.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister replies, will he amplify one point? His right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General interrupted my speech on Tuesday with reference to secondary picketing. What I did was presumably secondary picketing and was unlawful, because that was not my place of work. I am anxious not to be unlawful, and I inquired of the Attorney-General what one could and could not do. I said that if those circumstances arose again, I should feel duty bound to go round the corner and communicate with people there. He felt obliged to interrupt me to put my mind at rest. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mere peaceful communication does not create any offence."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, any secondary picket can go anywhere and communicate information without it being an offence. But his next sentence was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is communication coupled with persuasion and inducement."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 18 March 1980; c. 1337.]</p></blockquote>
So if I am unpersuasive in my communication, it is lawful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is all right here, then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not had much success in persuading hon. Gentlemen opposite. Normally, we get looks of blank incomprehension from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that one's communication is persuasive—after all, it is possible—then the picketing becomes unlawful. I should like the Under-Secretary to answer this question. Why is it lawful to communicate if one is not persuasive, but unlawful to communicate if one is persuasive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments will bear upon the provision in clause 14 that extends immunity to an official who is on
	<span class='label label-info column'>1448</span>
a picket line, provided that he is accompanying a member of the union, even though he, the official, is not at his own place of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an illustration of the value of consultation and the value that the Government attach to it. It was a consequence of representations made to us that we extended the wording of the original clause, because we took into account the value of having responsible trade union officials on the picket line. We entirely agree with what is said in the TUC guide about that and, accordingly, it has been inserted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition amendments Nos. 164 and 166 would widen the scope for trade union official attendance. Amendment No. 164 would make it lawful for a trade union official to picket any premises or site at which members of his union were employed whether or not those members were themselves picketing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 166 would specify circumstances in which a union official might join members of his union on a picket line at their request or at the request of the union. By itself the amendment would not alter the effect of the subsection since if officials have the right to accompany their members who are picketing lawfully it would be superfluous to provide that they may also accompany those members at their request or at the request of their union. Therefore, amendment No. 166 is unnecessary in any event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 164 is the substantive amendment. Our view is that it would unacceptably widen the scope for picketing by union officials. If officials of a union are unable to persuade their members to picket their own place of work, there seems no reason why the officials should be able to picket in their stead. The Government believe that union officials ought to be able to picket alongside their members who are picketing lawfully, so that they, as officials, can regulate behaviour on the picket line and ensure that picketing is conducted in an orderly and peaceful fashion. In many cases that is exactly what they do, and they ought to be permitted to do so and not be excluded by reason solely of the fact that they do not work at those premises. This view is entirely in line with TUC policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the attendance of officials on a picket line without their members would probably indicate either that their members whose place of work was being
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1280">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1449</span>
picketed had insufficient interest in the dispute to want to picket themselves or that their members disagreed with their trade union and were continuing to work, the dispute in this case being between the union and the employer rather than between the employee and the employer. In our view, in neither of these cases would it be justifiable for union officials to be picketing if they were not at their own place of work. But if a union official is at his place of work he is viewed in exactly the same way as any other person picketing at his own place of work and enjoys the same immunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Under-Secretary conceive of other circumstances and explanations for the union official being there by himself? Let us consider a small firm and, as I imagine would be preferable to him, a small number of pickets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary is familiar with the case of Piddington v. Bates, when the police officer insisted that there be only two pickets. Let us assume that one is the union official and the other is one of the workers. The worker says to his union official "I have stood here for 12 hours. I am hungry. I would like to go and have something to eat, or a cup of tea." Perhaps an understanding policeman might allow three pickets. That would not be a mass demonstration. There are only three pickets; it is something quite reasonable. If two people go away to have something to eat or to answer a call of nature or whatever, the union official is left there on his own. He is not accompanied. Does his presence immediately become unlawful just because there is only one inoffensive, peaceful union official imparting information?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is "No". on those facts; he does not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me say why not. If were not assailed by shouts of "Why not?", I could say why not. This enables me to answer the question with which the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) finished his speech. He asked why there is a difference between peacefully communicating and peacefully persuading somebody to break his contract
	<span class='label label-info column'>1450</span>
of employment. The two questions can be answered together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Immunity is only of any interest if there is something to be immune from. With what are we concerned that there should be immunity from? Answer: actions for damages for tort; actions claiming injunctions to restrain the commission of tort. What is a tort? A tort is a civil wrong that somebody may suffer when his civil rights are infringed. He may claim compensation for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What kind of civil wrong? Not every civil wrong; only the very special kind which is specified in section 13 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974
	<br><blockquote><p>"to induce another person to break a contract"</p></blockquote>
or to interfere with contractual relations. That is the only kind of tort that we are talking about.

Picketing is said to be lawful by section 15 of the 1974 Act, but how is it defined? It is expressed in this way:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be lawful for one or more persons in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute to attend at or near … a place where another person works or carries on business … for the purpose only of peacefully obtaining or communicating information"—</p></blockquote>
first leg—
	<br><blockquote><p>"or peacefully persuading any person to work or abstain from working"—</p></blockquote>
second leg. If one peacefully persuades somebody to abstain from working, what one is doing—if he is not self-employed—is persuading him to break his contract of employment. If one persuades someone to break a contract of employment, or any other contract, one is committing a tort against the person with whom he has that contract—in other words, in this case, his employer. That is what the common law says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If A has a contract with somebody and B comes along and tries to detach the other person from his contractual obligations to A, A is suffering a civil wrong, a tort. He may go to the court and ask the court to find accordingly, and perhaps, in a severe case, to give him an injunction restraining B from so doing. That is all that we are talking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, there is a distinction between what happens on a picket line when the picket is doing no more than peacefully imparting information—for example, he might say "I am on strike" or "I was sacked last week"—and what happens when he goes on to say "And now I ask
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1281">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1451</span>
you in solidarity to break your contract of employment and come out on strike in sympathy."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the second leg. It is only the second leg that constitutes a wrong—a tort—and it is therefore only in the case of the second leg that immunity from civil action is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, so long as the trade union official is standing there on his own and perhaps merely saying "These lads I am with are on strike" or "These lads I am with got the sack last week", he is only peacefully imparting information. He is not committing any wrong and therefore he needs no immunity. If, however, he goes further and says "I want you to come out on strike in sympathy with these lads whom I have been with all day—they are just up the road having a cup of tea", he is committing the wrong of seeking to induce people to break their contract of employment, and because he does not work there himself and at that time is not accompanying someone who works there, under the provisions of clause 14 he will not have immunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. and learned Gentleman is confusing two questions in one. The first is the intention of the Attorney-General in saying that he can communicate but must not persuade. I can envisage a trade union official going to the factory and saying to the workers "We are all on strike. I can tell you that officially. I could tell you also that I think you should not go to work, you should all go on strike"—nudge-nudge, wink-wink "but I must not tell you that because it would be unlawful". He would be immune.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one question. The answer to it—to paraphrase in plain English—is that if one seeks to communicate ineffectively that is lawful, but if one communicates effectively in the sense that action results it is unlawful. I think that I understand that. But that is a separate question from the one I posed in my original intervention, which was about the trade union official who must accompany someone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that the person he accompanies departs but the trade union official remains. So the trade union official is there on his own. Would that be unlawful?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just answered that, but obviously not sufficiently clearly. So
	<span class='label label-info column'>1452</span>
let me try again. If the trade union official is left on his own for only a short time, no one would be so stupid as to take action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he works there himself he does not have to worry because, whatever he says and does, he is protected by the provisions of clause 14. If he is left on his own and if he does not work there himself, he is not protected by clause 14 because he is not accompanying anyone; he does not have immunity. However, he will not need immunity if all that he is doing is imparting information, because that, for reasons that I have explained, does not constitute an actionable wrong. He would need immunity only if he were to persuade people to break their contract of employment. Those are the two limbs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the official seeks to induce someone to break his contract of employment, then, as he would be on his own, not accompanying anyone and not working there himself, he would be liable and he would have no immunity for the reasons I have explained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asks whether it makes any difference whether he says "nudge-nudge, wink-wink"—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Needham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He does not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He does not say it, but it is implied. It is always a question of fact whether, in reality, someone is persuading someone else to break his contract of employment. The courts look to the substance and not to the form. I hope I have made that clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful for the Under-Secretary's patience. I am referring to a primary picket where the trade union officials' purpose is to communicate, persuade and induce as they are legally entitled to do under the provisions of clause 14. It is a small firm and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1282">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1453</span>
officials say "Well, chaps, we must not have disturbances. We don't want hundreds of pickets. We will have only three pickets". Two pickets go away for a cup of tea, leaving the trade union official alone. Under the provisions of clause 14 without our amendment, surely that would be unlawful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must try to help the hon. Gentleman at the expense of detaining the Committee, because plainly he does not understand this point and it is my job to make it clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I start in this way. The purpose of clause 14 is to restrict immunity in the case of picketing, the immunity being immunity from civil action in respect of the wrong of inducing someone to break his contract. The clause provides that if one wants to induce people to break their contracts when one is acting as a picket, one must be picketing at one's own place of work. If it is anywhere else, one is liable to action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides an exception—and the Government think it right—because it is sensible to have trade union officials guiding pickets. Therefore, we do not want to say that every trade union official must be, in this respect, at his own place of work. We think that that is desirable and that we can safely allow a trade union official to be there, notwithstanding the fact that he does not work there, provided that he is accompanying someone who does. Even if the official persuades someone to break his contract of employment, he will be protected by immunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the famous cup of tea. The trade union official may be left on his own, and the hon. Gentleman asked whether he would, thereby, be made liable. It depends what he does during that period. If he simply communicates information, and no more, he is not committing a wrong because there is no wrong involved in communicating information. If, however, he goes further, and communicates information but also persuades a worker as he goes into his work place to break his contract of employment, he does commit a wrong. He will not then have the protection under the clause that he would have had when accompanying somebody who worked there. It is as simple as that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether or not he will have immunity during his lonely vigil, while his friends are having their cup of tea, will depend entirely upon whether he does anything that requires immunity and constitutes a
	<span class='label label-info column'>1454</span>
tort. That is entirely up to him. If he simply communicates information, OK. But if he goes further and says "Break your contract of employment because of what I have told you", he commits a wrong and he will need immunity which he will not receive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman appears to think that this is a very trivial point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the fact is that most pickets-98 per cent.—are in very small groups—two or three people. They are not mass pickets. So that example might well occur. It is not a theoretical case. Therefore, we are trying to establish that the official, when he is carrying out the proper function of a picket—which is not only to inform but also to persuade—should not suddenly become liable. That is an important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not treated it as trivial. I have mistakenly treated it as simple.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the Under-Secretary is so learned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: it does not call for any learning, but it calls for a clear explanation which I apparently have not given. I shall not try again. I think that I got it over to the hon. Gentleman last time. The whole problem can be avoided by having a staggered tea break.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And that is the hon. and learned Gentleman's advice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, everybody always calls for a practical approach to these matters, and I am glad to provide one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as the interest of the trade union official and the picket line generally, we must also have regard to the main interests which the clause is intended to serve. It is to restrict, to those who are working at the place being picketed, immunity from civil action if the induce the breaking of a contract. We must have regard to attempts that may be made to get round the provision. If we are to be pressed as hard as this when we make a concession in favour of trade union officials, it will serve as a disincentive to go any further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1283">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>6.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. and learned Gentleman leaves that point, will he spell out a little more clearly what he means by a breach of contract? One can imagine that there are employees who have signed a three-year or a five-year contract with their employer. If the contract is broken, either party can get damages or compensation. But there is no such contract between an hourly-paid employee and an employer. because the employee can leave at any time to get another job, he can take a day off to go to a football match, or he can go on strike if he wishes. There is no implied contract in those terms between the majority of employers and employees. How, then, can one induce a breach of contract, when no form of contract exists?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, the hon. Gentleman is wrong. It does not matter whether one is paid by the week, the month, the year or the hour; one has a contract of employment and is entitled under the Employment Protection Act to have a written statement of its terms and conditions after 13 weeks. Therefore, one has a contract of employment, and people can induce such employees to break it, irrespective of whether they are paid by the hour, the week or the month. If somebody says "Come out on strike", that by itself is inducing somebody to break his contract of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we do not think it possible to accept amendment No. 164, which widens in that way the circumstances in which a union official, with immunity. could picket without working at the place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to amendment No. 194. which was moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham (Mr. Lloyd). The amendment would limit full-time trade union officials to the right to accompany a member of their union who was picketing at his own place of work. Lay officials such as shop stewards will still be able to picket at their own place of work, whether or not they are accompanying their members. The amendment will ensure that a trade union official who is not working at the place which he is picketing shall be employed by the union if he is to have the immunity that clause 14 confers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened to what my hon. Friend and others said on that point and I accept at once that it is important that there should
	<span class='label label-info column'>1456</span>
be union representation on a picket line. It can be valuable. My hon. Friend described the amendment as a limited but useful amendment. He also said that trade union officials should be encouraged to take a part. But he recognised that there is scope here for abuse. That is indeed the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the wording of the clause there would be scope, in the exercise of the ingenuity that one often finds exercised in these matters, for flooding a picket line with people who constitute union officials under the definition in section 30 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 but who are not employed by the union. We think that it would be right to limit the trade union officials who do not work at the place being picketed to those employed by the union. As has been said, those would be fewer in number.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the important point is that this provision will not exclude trade union officials from taking a part on a picket line if they do not work at the place being picketed. It will simply limit them to those who are paid officials. But the vast majority of trade union officials who will be taking part in a picket will, without doubt, be those who work there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it seems to us right that this restriction in the clause as drafted should find its way into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman not think again? I appreciate that Ministers are always in difficulty when one of their own Back Benchers moves this sort of amendment, but will he not consider the matter again before Report?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the hon. and learned Gentleman suggesting that, in the case of unions which have lay executive councils and a lay president, it would be within the terms of this legislation that the president of a union could not attend to counsel his own members who were in dispute'? Many unions have branch secretaries who are lay men who have a great deal of knowledge. If a district official, who is probably tied up with all sorts of problems, has a spot of bother at some factory, shipyard or steelworks and asks the branch secretary to sort things out, the hon. and learned Gentleman is saying that he cannot attend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg the Under-Secretary to think again. If he accepts the amendment, it means that the consultations he had with the TUC were absolute nonsense, and he is effect-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1284">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1457</span>
tively rejecting the advice which it gave and which he accepted at that stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the effect of the amendment were that he could not attend, I should not accept it. But the amendment does not say that. All it says is that if he attends and takes part in persuading people to break their contract, he will not have immunity. It does not say that he cannot attend and give them advice as to what they should do and how they should conduct themselves, and so on. Any official who visits a picket line manned by his members at their own place of work would not be acting unlawfully if he simply visited them and gave them advice, counselled them, and so forth. He would be acting unlawfully only if he took part in persuading other people to break their contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what I was saying a few moments ago. if a person communicates information, lie is not committing a wrong. No immunity is needed. It is only when a person actually takes part in persuading people to break their contracts that a wrong is committed and the person then needs immunity. That meets the hon. Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I am afraid that the Under-Secretary does not understand the position that would arise on a picket line. He is saying that the branch secretary or some other unpaid official of the union—it may be the president of the union, as my hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) said—can go along and stand talking to pickets at the factory gate while the picketing is taking place and other people on that picket line are attempting to induce people to be in breach of contracts—in other words, other people are doing the thing which is lawful in their case only because they are at their own place of work. If the employer comes out and sees one man whom he knows not to be an employee at his work place and whom he knows is a union official, on whom will he serve his writ to take the man to court for an injunction or for damages? The Under-Secretary says that this unpaid official is quite safe as long as he is only giving advice to his members. He is not safe in that circumstance, because the employer will, of course, assume that he was taking part in the picket and taking part in persuasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1458</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is entirely a matter of fact for any court as to what is taking place at any time and whether any complaint is made. It is perfectly possible for an experienced trade union organiser or official, lay president, convenor, or whatever, to observe the distinction between simply attending and giving advice to pickets or communicating information, and, on the other hand, inducing a breach of contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the amendment would protect an employer when a union, which perhaps had only a few members picketing at their place of work, sought to increase the size of the picket line by bringing in large numbers of lay officials with no connection other than membership of the same union as the workers in dispute. That seems to me something which might well occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Accordingly, although I have listened carefully to what has been said, I advise the Committee that the amendment seems sensible to us. I shall give the assurance that I shall consider further what has been said and if necessary come forward later with any variation that is thought desirable. At present the Government are minded to accept my hon. Friend's amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the lion. and learned Gentleman considers the matter, will he refresh his memory of clause I in respect of ballots? There was reference to the phrase "employee of the union". It was felt that the word "employee was unfortunate. He took our point then and agreed to reconsider it. We also pointed out that often the senior official of a union is the president and asked, "Should not the presidency be balloted for by post?" The Minister agreed to come back with a better form of words. I can think of no one more eminent in my union than the president, who is a lay official. He is not paid a wage by the union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If our president is arrested the Government will regret it. The hon. and learned Gentleman wants responsible union officials to be present on picket lines to see that they are conducted in an orderly fashion. We are saying that some of the most eminent union officials are not paid wages by a union and therefore are not its employees. Therefore the Government are reincorporating into the Bill similar faulty wording to that which they agreed in principle to delete from clause I Now
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1285">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1459</span>
there is a mischievous amendment to put similar wording into this clause. Surely that must be a mistake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will think very carefully about what he has put to the Committee and consider whether he should retreat from that position. We have already pointed out how the Government—
The Chairman: Order. I may have made a mistake which I should put right for the Committee. I thought that the hon. and learned Gentleman had given way to the hon. Gentleman.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is perfectly correct, Mr. Leadbitter, and I am grateful to you. I had forgotten that I gave way in the distant past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always tried to take in the points made by both sides. I have indicated that this seems to us an attractive and sensible amendment. But there are considerations that must be taken into account. As I have stated that if it seems advisable we shall come forward with something else on Report, it may be that my hon. Friend, having given a fair airing to the subject in his amendment—for which I am grateful—would save the Committee's time if he were now to withdraw it. Then we should be able to think about the matter again and come forward with whatever seemed right at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand and share the anxiety to get on, but speaking on behalf of my party, if I may be so presumptuous, I urge the hon. and learned Gentleman to think very carefully about what he said. I hope that before he decides to go along the path of this amendment he will have further consultations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said earlier that the the Government had alienated any good will they might have hoped for from the TUC at a time when they desperately need it, and this will only further embitter the relationship between the Government, the TUC and the trade union movement. The idea that the president of a great national union should be denied the right to speak to his members in an industrial dispute will be totally unacceptable to the president of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1460</span>
National Union of Railwaymen, the president of the Transport and General Workers Union, the senior officials of many other great trade unions and to a much wider group of people than those unions or ourselves, and we find it totally unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I add one further word. I find it difficult to understand the somewhat artificial division that seems to be developing between peacefully persuading and peacefully communicating. I believe that I understood the altercation, if that is the right word, between the hon. and learned Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton). If I understood the hon. and learned Gentleman aright, he said that if there is a strike or dispute at an establishment with pickets outside and a trade union representative goes along to speak to those pickets, he may or not be within the scope of the clause according to his purpose in visiting them. If he seeks to persuade people to join the strike and thus to break their contracts, he will be inducing a breach of contract and therefore will be caught by these provisions. However, if he is simply going along to ask " How are things going, chaps? Keep up the good work—I am going to see the lads at Smith and Brown's and will see you later " and so on, that will be all right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman to consider the alternative scenario for what I think he suggested might be a different situation where the people are not out on strike and the official goes along and says something to the people employed at that establishment which subsequently leads them to go on strike. The hon. and learned Gentleman almost certainly would say that the action of the official would be regarded as action which induced the people to come out on strike in breach of their contracts and therefore that he falls foul of the changes in the law. But is the reality anything like that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that it was the president of the National Union of Railwaymen that was concerned. I am not necessarily talking of men working on the railways in the context of a railway strike—it could be the railway workshops at Doncaster—so it would not be a matter of picketing one's own place of work. The president of the NUR goes along and says "Hey, you blighters are in at work—don't you know that the union has called a strike? " He will have told them their duty. Has he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1286">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1461</span>
communicated with them or has he persuaded them to break their contracts and say "Joe is outside and has reminded us that we should be out—everybody out from lunchtime"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make this point only to show that matters are not so clear as the hon. and learned Gentleman seems to think. He may say that these matters will eventually be determined by a court of law. But who will know what the exchange was between the workmen and the president?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I hope that the Committee will divide on amendment No. 164, presented by my hon. Friend the Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Radice), and I urge my hon. Friends to vote for it.

I believe that if no change is made in the clause, that will be a mischievous decision, because it will leave the Bill unclear about who would be able to accompany a primary picket on his picket line. It would be open to any union to alter its rules—or even leave them as they are—and appoint unpaid officials so that they could accompany a picket legitimately and lawfully.</p>
	<p>As my hon. and learned Friend has rapidly taken my point, I am happy to leave it with him to consider further. On that basis, I. beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed:</i> No. 164, in page 13, line 41, leave out "whom he is accompanying".—[	<i>Mr. Harold Walker.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Question Put,</i>That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i>Ayes 8, Noes 11.</p>
	<p>happy about clause 14. There is a school of thought within the labour and trade union movement that the tabling of helpful amendments indicates that the Opposition support the clause concerned. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is an appalling clause in an atrocious Bill, which we shall seek to defeat both in Committee and on Report. But it is our duty as an Opposition to examine the Bill and look for drafting errors made by the Government. Where we spot them, we should help put them right.</p>
	<p>We wish to do that in new subsection (3). I am sure that the thinking behind it concerns the fact that, if a man loses his job in furtherance of a trade dispute, he goes away and gets employment. Obvi-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1287">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1463</span>
ously, he will still feel upset and annoyed about the circumstances of his losing his job, and he comes back and joins the picket line. He would then be a secondary picket on what would otherwise be a primary picket line. In that context the Ministers, with their limited knowledge of actual industrial relations as opposed to the theory of the law, thought that they should put in something to cover that highly unlikely event.</p>
	<p>I am sure that anyone with any knowledge of industrial relations or practice as is carried out on the factory floor knows that if a man finds another job during an industrial dispute he is unlikely to go back to the place of the first dispute. It will be hard enough to settle down in his job.</p>
	<p>However, the Government have not considered that an awful lot of workers, like some Members of Parliament, have second jobs. They have part-time jobs as taxi-drivers or barmen, or jobs of that calibre, to eke out their meagre wages, generally because of economic circumstances forced on them by the Tory Government. If there is an industrial dispute in which a man loses his job, he will still retain his employment as a concert pianist, as someone playing the drums in the club or as a barman. He could then well be held to be in employment, which would be ridiculous and farcical.</p>
	<p>I am not talking about the black economy which the Tory Party continually seeks to ignore, but about legitimate employment, which a man registers for tax purposes and in relation to which he pays his taxes and national insurance contributions. But he would still have employment.</p>
	<p>We could get the lunatic situation that an employer—after all, we are talking about a dispute in which men and women get angry—would be able to take out an injunction against that individual on the ground that he had employment. Therefore, under clause 14(3) as drafted, the employee would be in an entirely different position from that of his colleagues who were also on the picket line but did not have part-time jobs. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will recognise that it is essential that subsection (3) is redrafted.</p>
	<p>It is also important to make the point that when such situations arise, the majority of those involved—this point seems to escape the Ministers and the Tory Party—have very little knowledge of the law. They do not carry Employment
	<span class='label label-info column'>1464</span>
Acts in their back pockets. They do not have a barrister on every picket line to advise them what clause 14 or any other clause of the Bill means. They carry out their duties and their business in what they regard as a normal, sensible way.</p>
	<p>I am sure that the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary are men of some intelligence in the Tory Party and have some standing in it at the moment. I hope that they will continue to have that in the future. I put it to them that this is an important amendment. It is the duty of Committees scrutinising Bills to recognise odd situations as they arise. I understand the thinking behind the drafting of subsection (3), but I am seeking to point out the lunatic situations which could arise as a result of that subsection and to put them right simply by taking out those few words. The subsection would then read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the case of a worker whose last employment was terminated in connection with a trade dispute"</p></blockquote>
and so on. That would be eminently sensible. It would be understandable to all those involved in a dispute in which picketing occurred.</p>
	<p>I shall finish on this note, because it is time Opposition Members tried to inject a degree of common sense and practicality into the Government's thinking on this subject. I am beginning to get the impression that the United Kingdom consists of masses of pickets marching up and down the country picketing almost every establishment where people are employed. As I am sure my hon. Friends are well aware, the truth is that in the vast majority of industrial situations, when we mount a picket line—and we do not mount a picket line in every situation—it consists of two or three lonely souls standing in the rain trying to put their case to whoever will stop.</p>
	<p>Whilst the Under-Secretary gave a full explanation of most of the points raised on the first group of amendments, it is significant that he did not deal with my query about how one stops a lorry. How does one peacefully persuade a lorry driver? The hon. and learned Gentleman spoke eloquently on that subject on the Report stage of the Employment Protection Act, but he is a Minister now and he has got his head right beneath the counter.</p>
	<p>On a placatory note, I put it to the Minister that he should accept this eminently sensible amendment. We can then move on to the last group of amendments.</p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>6.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the placatory tone of the hon. Gentleman's speech. I am entirely placated. Indeed, there was never any need for the hon. Gentleman to placate me. But I am afraid that that does not mean that I can recommend my right hon. Friends to accept this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 14 gives—or retains—immunify for those who are picketing at their place of work. We thought it fair to include in that immunity those who, having lost their jobs there as a result of an industrial dispute, remain unemployed. We thought it would be rather hard if we were to say "Now that you have lost your job you do not have a place of work and therefore you may not picket."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, let us take the case which is the foundation for the hon. Gentleman's amendment. It is the case of someone who has another job. Either he has acquired another job since lie lost his first one, or he has a job of sufficient substance to count as his being in employment. We do not think that he would have sufficient interest in the original industrial dispute to warrant his picketing his old place of work and attracting the same immunity as those to whom clause 14 is intended to apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Workers whose employment is terminated in the course of a prolonged dispute, who have alternative employment but who may wish to return when the dispute is over, are also probably in the hon. Gentleman's mind. But if one were to enable those people to picket, one would also enable anyone whose previous employment was terminated in connection with a trade dispute to picket his former place of work whether or not he was likely to want to return. Therefore, although I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying and I am grateful to him for the way in which he moved his amendment, we do not think that it would be right to extend the immunity further in favour of those who have lost their jobs and therefore no longer have a connection with the place of work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to prolong the debate on amendment No. 168, but I would like to sort this matter out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the case of a man who is in employment and who also has a part-time job as, for instance, a taxi-driver. There are many thousands of people in that situation. If he loses his job in furtherance of a trade
	<span class='label label-info column'>1466</span>
dispute, he naturally carries on the part-time job as a taxi-driver which he has probably had for many years. Clause 14 could mean that because he had that part-time job, he could not join his colleagues on the picket line. is that what the hon. and learned Gentleman is suggesting?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is so, would the individual who had lost his job in furtherance of a trade dispute have to give up his part-time job as a taxi-driver in order to be allowed to come on to the picket line? Surely that is not a state of affairs that the hon. and learned Gentleman would justify?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the first question depends upon whether the man's part-time job as a taxi-driver was of such substance as to constitute his being in employment. As to the second question, if the man was not in employment lie would be entitled under the clause—so I am advised—to the benefit of the clause and to the immunity it would confer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of that rather strange answer from the Under-Secretary, I shall not press the amendment, because, clearly, it is a point to which we shall wish to return on the Floor of the House. I believe that when the Under-Secretary thinks this through he will recognise that the Opposition have found a genuine anomaly. I suggest to him that a second thought is necessary and would probably be beneficial to the Bill.

	<span class='label label-info column'>1467</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I move the amendment in a super-placatory manner in the hope of getting a favourable response from the hon. and learned Gentleman, although I am not over-optimistic in that respect. I do not need to speak at any great length on the amendment because we have covered its purport more than adequately in our debates, thanks to your indulgence, Mr. Leadbitter. I shall therefore address myself briefly to amendments Nos. 170 and 174.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of those two amendments is to cover two eventualities. First, under the provisions of the clause, two categories of pickets are set up—the unlicensed and the licensed picket. The lawful picket, picketing his own place of work, can reasonably expect to be free of any action in respect of an injunction or action for damages for inducing breach of contract. But that is not so for an unlawful picket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is likely to arise when the unlicensed or unlawful picket joins a picket line manned by the lawful picket. These amendments do not cover what happens when the unlawful picket is invited to the picket lines by the lawful picket. They cover what happens when the unlawful picket decides to join the lawful one, perhaps to communicate information, or because those picketing are in some way involved with the firm which is being picketed although the provisions of the Bill do not affect them directly because it is not their place of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the provisions of section 13(4) of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974, there is an immunity with regard to conspiracy except where a person acting singly is acting unlawfully. It therefore follows that if a picket is acting unlawfully, it is possible to infect the previous lawful picketing with that unlawfulness, to use an appalling phrase. I am seeking to obviate not the case in which there is a direct combination between the two—where the two join hand in hand, as it were—and the lawful picket and the unlawful picket together stop the lorry and perhaps interfere with a contract, but the case where the mere presence of unlawful pickets could make normally lawful picketing unlawful and make the lawful pickets subject to an action for damages or an injunction. That is the situation that we seek to avoid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have made the matter clear by seeking to put it in reasonably non-legal language. I should be grateful if the hon. and learned Gentleman would respond accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1468</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to speak to amendment No. 68, in my name, which is included in this group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of amendment No. 68 is to ensure that not only are individuals penalised for unlawful picketing, but that if they are acting collectively, as in many cases they will be, those who join them are also put at risk. In other words, if they are members of a trade union and are acting on a trade union's instructions, the trade union will also be at risk through being made subject to an injunction and, if the matter is not settled at that point, its funds will also be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say that for a number of reasons. First, I do not believe that the provisions of the clause are practicable. I have listened carefully to what my right hon. and hon. Friends have said, but I do not believe that they are living in the real world. They are living in a world of hope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look at the matter this way. If a swarm of bees or wasps descends on a particular location, it is no good just swatting one of them. One must go to the hive. If the bees are deprived of their honey, they will take notice. They will not come back. One gets at the collective, not the individual. It is no good just pulling out the bee's sting. The same applies here if this proposal is to be successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench seem to believe that the analogy is not so much with bees or wasps. They do not wish to stir up a hornets' nest. I understand their fears. But I do not believe that they are applying the right remedy to the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to put a number of questions to my hon. and learned Friend. How long will he wait to see whether the mild treatment that he seeks to apply works? Will it be the end of this year, the beginning of next year or the end of next year? That is an important consideration. If he waits too long, public opinion—which at present supports the measures being taken for trade union reform—will turn sour. The public will not think that a second bite at the cherry will be of any use. They will say "Why should we be in favour of more legislation when the first lot did not work?" Therefore, it is important to get it right now, not in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, will the timing of any additional legislation be practical? After all, we are not in the run-up to a general election.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1290">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1469</span>
Further aggravation from extremist elements—admittedly, not the generality of the trade union movement—may make matters more difficult. It will be argued, as it has been argued in present circumstances, that we must not react to events; we should take a cool, step-by-step look at what is going on and not over-react. But I am afraid that the situation may be more difficult in future if we do not get it right now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A much more important question needs to be answered at this stage. If the moderate, mild measure suggested now proves inadequate, what fall-back position have the Government considered? What are the options? Is one option to apply criminal sanctions or, as my amendment suggests, to put at risk trade union funds? Unless we know that the options are for the future, we are working very much in the dark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further question needs to be asked. We have heard often enough from the Attorney-General and from my hon. and learned Friends that the plans assume that everyone will be law abiding and that no serious challenge to clause 14 will arise. But how does my hon. and learned Friend know that everyone will be obedient in such a situation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. and learned Friends have also said that the trade union movement has behaved responsibly. But all the evidence of recent years shows that minority extremists have not behaved in a moderate and reasonable way. Therefore, we must consider what the position will be with regard to the law when it comes to dealing with the small extremist minority. That is what I meant when I said this morning that 99 per cent. of the trade union movement will be law abiding, but that the law has to provide proper sanctions for that small minority that will bring it into disrepute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the procedures are overoptimistic. Unlawful pickets will not necessarily co-operate and willingly identify themselves and employers seeking injunctions will quite often meet obstacles that these procedures, using the civil law, will not prove sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not go so far as to suggest that my right hon. Friend and my hon. and learned Friend are living in cloud-cuckoo land, but I believe that they are guilty of dangerous optimism and are living on faith, hope and charity. They are living in faith that there will be moderation, in hope that we shall not see scenes such as
	<span class='label label-info column'>1470</span>
we saw throughout the 1970s, and on the charity of Arthur Scargill and other extremists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They are also placing their bets on co-operation from the TUC. Only this afternoon, I heard a right hon. Gentleman opposite saying that the TUC is not co-operating with the Government because it does not like what is proposed. I am not sure that it could be said that we are getting an enormous amount of cooperation from the Opposition, either.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman may have misheard me, because he is certainly misrepresenting my remarks. I said that the Government, at a time when they needed the maximum good will and support from the working class and its organisations and the TUC, were by their actions alienating that support and good will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I come to my final observation. I believe that clause 14 was conceived as an olive branch, but in fact it will be born in due course—in the summer—as a fig leaf which will cover the impotence of this measure. By contrast, if the Government accept my amendment to join the trade union movement as well and put its funds at risk, they will have not a fig leaf, but an extremely durable suit of clothes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member talked about an olive branch. I suppose he meant that the Government had extended an olive branch to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am perfectly candid. I think that this clause was intended by the Government as an olive branch and as a mild measure in the hope that the Opposition and the TUC would accept it. But, clearly, there is no point in offering olive branches if they are not acceptable and if they will not work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend had been sitting with me during the discussions that I had with the TUC, he would not by any stretch of the imagination be able to describe the Government's attitude towards the TUC on this clause, or the TUC's attitude towards me on the clause, as anything resembling an olive branch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is as may be. My right hon. Friend may well be right. But as he has been described as a dove, I thought it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1291">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1471</span>
only appropriate that I should arm him with the traditional weapons that the dove is supposed to carry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Leadbitter, you will recall that during an earlier speech you advised me to defer part of it until clause stand part. You said later that there probably would not be a clause stand part debate. I therefore searched diligently through this group of amendments and found that I could quite properly make these few remarks in this debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In order that the record may be right and the Chairman be truthfully recorded, I must add that I later advised the hon. Member that he should take the opportunity to make his speech before the clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to you, Mr. Leadbitter. I am concerned about the liability of people to be sued, and these amendments are therefore the appropriate time for my comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer, in particular, to the inconsistency between the working paper and clause 14 in the provisions affecting first suppliers and first customers. The approaches of the working paper and the clause are totally different. We are assured that if and when the provisions in the working paper are enacted, as long as the tests of capability and motive are satisfied it will be open to people engaged in a dispute with their own employers to induce the employees of a firm which is a first customer or a first supplier to be in breach of contract with such firms as part of the process of extending the dispute. The only thing that they are not allowed to do in order to induce that breach of contract is to picket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems to me to be completely inconsistent. They can write letters, send telegrams, make telephone calls, erect placards and posters at the factory gate. If they wish, they can even hire a helicopter and drop leaflets all over the place. But they may not picket. If one man sfands at the factory gate to say, "Look, gentlemen, there is a dispute going on that involves your firm, as you are customers of, or suppliers to, our firm. How about joining us?", he will be in danger of being sued. He will be outside the immunity provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is nonsense. I realise that the Under-Secretary has already commented on that discrepancy of approach. However,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1472</span>
I feel that his explanation was unsatisfactory. I mention in passing that if the Government think that by enacting the provision in the working paper they can prevent actions such as the calling out of the private sector of the steel industry, they may be on to a loser there as well. Perhaps they do not appreciate the amount of trade that takes place between the public and private sectors of the steel industry. It is unlikely that if the provision had been in force Mr. Sirs and his friends would have found themselves situated any differently from their present position, which the House of Lords ruled was quite lawful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether or not that is so, it is still quite inconsistent to make picketing the only form of industrial action that is unlawful in relation to first customers and suppliers. The Under-Secretary told us why the Government were making that provision. It is because picketing is the easiest way for workers involved in disputes to cause damage to employers not involved in the dispute. That was the only reason. Bear in mind that those employers, being first customers or suppliers, are those liable to be damaged by other forms of industrial action. Apparently it is perfectly in order to damage them in other ways, but not by picketing, because picketing is the easiest way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are saying that it is perfectly proper for first and second customers of a firm in dispute to be brought into the dispute through industrial action being extended to them. The Government are merely prohibiting what they regard as the easiest way of doing that. That is a totally unprincipled approach. To say that it is perfectly all right for other firms to be brought into the dispute so long as that is not done by the easiest method is to show a severe lack of principle, to say the least.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Government will find themselves mistaken in their view that picketing is the easiest method. That view was expressed by the Under-Secretary. I think that the easiest method is for the executive council of the union concerned to pass a resolution about it. Picketing usually follows rather than precedes the passing of a resolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is absolutely unjust to make someone liable to be sued for attempting to achieve his object by standing at the factory gate, yet to allow him to achieve the same object with impunity by any other means, such as by writing letters or passing resolutions.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1292">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1473</span>
Yet that is what the Government are doing in this clause, relating it to the working paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am constantly amazed by the Under-Secretary's alternating naiveté and deviousness. He shows himself to have no knowledge whatever of what actually goes on in the great big world of trade unions. He has never been anywhere near a picket line or a trade union meeting. He is quite out of touch with that kind of reality. When he speaks on those subjects he is quite pathetic. Yet he produces the most convoluted arguments to justify the unjustifiable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must confess that in this case the hon. Gentleman has not tried anything sophisticated. He simply said that the Government were stopping picketing in that context because it was the easiest way for unions to achieve their object. Nothing could be simpler than that. And nothing could be more unjust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Wolfson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to pick up the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, Norfh (Mr. Gorst), when he said that he did not believe that these provisions were practicable. The question that we need to consider with great care, because it has been echoed on both sides of the Committee, is whether the clause will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) told the Committee at the start of the debate that he would support the clause if he could be more certain that it was practicable. I regret that he is not with us this evening, but I expect that he has other engagements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North made his point clearly. He regards the clause as it stands as not necessarily practicable. The Opposition deplore the clause in various extreme and less extreme terms as an unwarranted attack on the trade unions, an example of the Tories' lack of understanding of trade unionism and how trade unionists feel, and as a major limitation on the ability of workers to combine with solidarity to achieve their legitimate ends. I suggest that none of those points made by the Opposition is true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But at the end of all that, the Opposition also argue that the clause will not work anyway. I suggest that there is common ground among a number of us who doubt the effectiveness of the clause in reality—
	<span class='label label-info column'>1474</span>
on the picket line, in the unions and within the company—albeit that we harbour those doubts for very different reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not share the faith of my hon. and learned Friend and constituency neighbour in the due processes of the law, as it would stand under the clause, to sort out difficulties and find a satisfactory solution when they arise in practice. I want to approach the problem from the practical viewpoint of the manager and the trade unions. I am not entirely satisfied that that has been done by my hon. and learned Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause exactly clarifies which picketing is lawful and which is unlawful. It therefore follows that once Parliament has passed the Bill it will be crucial that the remedies against unlawful picketing be effective, practical and clearly understood by those who may be picketed and those who may picket. The Opposition have made it clear on many occasions that they argue against the clause because they do not believe that it will be easily understood by those who may picket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remedy against unlawful picketing hinges on the obtaining of an injunction against named individuals to prevent their continuing to picket unlawfully. The fact is that employers are reluctant to use injunctions because they are time-consuming and there is no certainty that they will achieve a remedy. Injunctions require that individuals be named. It is in that area that believe we shall run up against specific and practical problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the employer who seeks an injunction against an unlawful picket wishes to name the individuals in the first instance—my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North has already described two examples from Grunwick and Garners Steak Houses—difficulties may be put in the way of that naming. The police may advise against the management going out to a picket as it could cause a breach of the peace. But, assuming that names are obtained, the first injunction may be ineffective because different people from those originally named follow on to carry out the picketing, and at the very least that will require a member of the management to attend with counsel or a solicitor and to appear before a judge in chambers—go through the same procedure again. Naturally, employers are uneasy and concerned about that problem. That, too, will make employers less ready to bring an injunction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employers are not clear, either, about

	<span class='label label-info column'>1475</span>
the procedure for bringing an injunction and do not fully understand it. That will be a disincentive to using it. I go further. There is no guarantee that once the first injunction has been issued picketing will fall away. Again, it is an area of trust and hope. I agree that up to now in many cases when an injunction has been brought the trade union or member involved has followed the lead given by the law on the first injunction and has not carried on picketing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we are moving into circumstances in which lawful picketing is much more tightly controlled. We know from the Opposition that there could be considerable irritation among trade unionists at the Bill's effect. Therefore I suggest that on past experience we have no guarantee that picketing will necessarily fall away and that opportunities may not be taken as the law stands at present to bring in others against whom the initial injunction would not be valid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Needham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One accepts the complexities of the introduction of law into industrial relations and that it must be carefully thought out. But would not my hon. Friend agree that that is true whenever law is instituted? For example, commercial law is not easily understandable. Any employer or manager who goes to court in a dispute with another person or company knows that such matters are complicated and difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why does my hon. Friend suggest that, when no law has existed, what the Government propose should be different from any other legislation? Surely, his argument is for not introducing any form of law because of its complexities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wolfson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention, but if he has patience—I admit that I am trying it hard, late in the day as this is—to hear me out he will realise why what I have said is relevant to the point that I wish to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is that we require legislation. The clause clarifies what picketing will be lawful and what will not. But as the law stands now there is not sufficient confidence among those who will be involved as employers requiring injunctions that an injunction will be effective in stopping unlawful picketing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In support of my argument I quote Lord Diplock:
	<span class='label label-info column'>1476</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Civil actions cannot be brought against unions but against individual defendants only, and only those individuals are bound to observe the injunctions. Everyone else involved in the industrial action could carry on with impunity doing that from which the individual defendants had been restrained."</p></blockquote>
What concerns me here is ultimately achieving a change in the law which will ensure that an employer does not have to go through the achievement of a second, third, fourth or fifth injunction in order to make that stick and get the picketing, which is unlawful, to cease. A way through is to make the act of picketing unlawful and not require an injunction against individuals only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here I wish to cite another instance of where the same requirement was brought into law. I must remind the Committee of the problem with squatters in the early 1970s. We all remember how much that was in the public eye and how property-owners found that they were unable to deal with the problem of squatting because of the difficulty of getting injunctions against named individuals. As a result, the landlord, however ligitimate his cause in seeking to obtain repossession of his property, was unable to do so because the injunction would not stick.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So a change was made, not in the substantive law, but in the procedural rules which were then adopted by the High Court and the Court of Appeal. These were known as the Rules of the Supreme Court, made under powers conferred by statute. They have themselves the force of statute in matters of procedure. The rule-making power extends only, as I said, to matters of procedure. It cannot confer any new jurisdiction, create or alter any substantive rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) asked what should be done if the law as it stands is not effective. We had a law to deal with the problem of squatters, but it was ineffective. After the High Court had seen examples of the law not being practically applied, it made a change in the procedural rules in order to achieve effective action. I suggest that an order similar to order 113 could be used in the case of picketing. It would allow for the court to put the act of picketing outside the law. The individuals concerned would not then need to be named. Notices could be put up after the first named pickets had ceased to picket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would demonstrate that in that area those who followed on and wished to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1294">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1477</span>
picket would be acting unlawfully under that injunction. It would still keep the action within the civil law and would not put it into the criminal law. But it would give the individual employer the opportunity to have the backing of the law and its processes in preventing unlawful picketing by new individuals. It would not affect those who were lawfully picketing.

The Government should give serious consideration to the introduction of an order such as order 113, possibly through legislation in Parliament, which would be the correct way in which to debate it openly and clearly. Otherwise, in, say, two to three years' time, we might find that the law was proving effective and that the judges, who already come under criticism from Opposition Members and trade unionists because they are regarded, in my view quite incorrectly, as unsympathetic to the aims and objectives of the trade unions, would need to bring in an order 113, when I contend that it is our job in the Committee to consider that point extremely carefully and not just to throw it away as unimportant or unnecessary.

The job of the Committee, as I understand it as a new Member of the House, is to look at the law that we are suggesting comes out of the Committee and be certain that it is a law which will work. At the moment I am doubtful that it will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
