</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Reginald Eyre)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On this happy occasion, I remind the Committee that at the conclusion of last Thursday's sitting my hon. Friend the Minister for Trade was responding to the debate on the two sets of amendments to clause 35, this is, amendments Nos. 199, 201 and 234, and amendments Nos. 202 and 203. When the Committee adjourned, the Minister had replied to the first group but he had not been able to deal with the second.<br><br>
I shall do so now, and it is important that I do, because I fear that my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) and I have a degree of disagreement on the basic effect of the Bill as drafted in this respect. I hope that at least on these amendments we may be able to reach an agreed solution.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend fears that clause 35(1) will prohibit gifts of shares to a company. In effect, he fears that we are overruling the decision in <i>in re</i> Castiglione's will trusts. He has, therefore, brought forward amendment No. 202.<br><br>
Amendment No. 203 supplements No. 202 and serves to modify the rule in Castiglione's case to a limited extent. In that case, shares were bequeathed directly to the company, but since the company could not be registered as a member of itself, the bequest was taken by nominees who were to be the registered shareholders and who were to hold the shares for the benefit of the company. Amendment No. 203 would allow the company to register the shares in its own name instead of in the name of a nominee. I hope that I have fairly stated my right hon. Friend's case.<br><br>
May I now state the view that we take. When clause 35(1) speaks of prohibiting a company from acquiring its own shares, that prohibition does not overturn the decision in Castiglione's case because in those circumstances the company does not acquire any shares. It is the nominee who acquires the shares. Therefore, clause 35(1) does not apply to such acquisitions.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend and I are at one
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0134">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 237</span>
on what we seek to achieve. We differ on what needs to be done to achieve that end. It is a case of construing the Bill. I accept that there might be arguments if all we had to guide us was clause 35(1). What does "acquire" mean? Does it cover acquire through a nominee as well as acquire directly?<br><br>
Clause 35 is closely related in substance, as well as physically or geographically in the Bill, with clauses 36 and 37. In those clauses, both as they stand in the Bill and under the Government amendments on the Notice Paper which relate to them, which we shall shortly discuss, clear distinction is drawn between acquisitions by a company and acquisition by a nominee for the company.<br><br>
May we look, in particular, at clause 37(1) as it now stands in the Bill. Government amendment No. 180 on the Paper relates to this provision, but for the convenience of the Committee I shall concentrate on the Bill as it now stands. I assure right hon. and hon. Gentlemen that the argument of construction which I am advancing is equally valid on the amendments proposed.<br><br>
Broadly speaking, clause 37 deals with certain cases where a company or its nominee validly holds shares in the company. To comply with the directive, clause 37 requires that the company or its nominee must dispose of the shares within a certain period, failing which the shares must be cancelled. Meanwhile, the company cannot vote the shares.<br><br>
According to my right hon. Friend, clause 35(1) has overturned the rule in Castiglione's case, and the only exceptions to clause 35(1) are the three cases in clause 35(3). Under paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of that subsection, the company has immediately to cancel the shares as a matter of law, so there can be no question of a continued holding of them. Paragraph (<i>c</i>) deals with the forfeiture or surrender. It will be seen that that is covered by paragraph (<i>a</i>) of subsection (1) of clause 37.<br><br>
Therefore, having reached that point, in my right hon. Friend's view, we face a problem. What circumstances does clause 37(1)(b) cover? It cannot cover any of the exceptions in clause 35(3)—as I have just explained these are dealt
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 238</span>
with in other ways. What does that leave? With respect, it covers—indeed, it was certainly intended to cover—the rule in Castiglione's case. There is nothing else that it can mean. In turn, that must mean that, since clause 37 recognises that rule as valid and continuing, it cannot fall under the prohibition under clause 35(1).<br><br>
What this comes to is that a person who acquires a beneficial interest in property through a trustee or nominee does not acquire that property. However, while I must therefore advise my right hon. Friend that amendment No. 202 is not necessary to protect the rule in Castiglione's case as it stands, that does not deal with the purpose of amendment No. 203, which seeks to get rid of the need for the nominee to hold the shares for the company.<br><br>
It was accepted between us last week that this was hardly a vital issue one way or the other, but it seems to be unnecessary to maintain the need for a nominee in such cases and I agree that such a change should be made. However, such a relaxation needs careful consideration in drafting for it then requires an exception to clause 35(1) of a similar sort to that proposed in amendment No. 202, because with the change in the law now proposed the need for an exception then arises. There may also be a need to amend clause 37, to which there are already Government amendments on the Amendment Paper. These amendments also may need amendment.<br><br>
In this situation, may I suggest that if my right hon. Friend is now prepared not to proceed with his amendments Nos. 202 and 203, I shall undertake that before Report I shall confer with him about the amendments that are necessary to these clauses with a view to those amendments being tabled on Report, either in his name or as Government amendments. We could then consider clause 37 and the amendments to it on the Paper in their present form, but on the understanding that they may need further amendment on Report to reflect the modification and relaxation of the rule in Castiglione's case that has been proposed, and with which I agree, namely, that companies themselves should be able to acquire fully paid up shares by way of gift and should not have to arrange for nominees to hold
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0135">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 239</span>
them on their behalf. I hope that, on consideration, my right hon. Friend will be able to agree to that proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for the assurances which he has given with regard to amendments Nos. 202 and 203. As I said previously, I do not believe that amendment No. 203 is of vital importance, but it seems common sense.<br><br>
On amendment No. 202, I make just this comment on the point that if a company acquires shares in the name of a nominee it does not acquire those shares. It certainly acquires a beneficial interest in the shares, and it seems to me that it is splitting hairs to say that it does not acquire—in the ordinary sense of that word—those shares. However, we shall consider that further when my hon. Friend puts down amendments to take account of my amendments Nos. 202 and 203.<br><br>
In this group of amendments we are concerned mainly with the first one, No. 199, which seeks to display this clause to private companies and to apply it only to public companies. I repeat that I am not inclined to withdraw it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am troubled about the proposition put by the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page). Not only would. I adduce the argument that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Warley, West (Mr. Archer) adduced at the previous sitting—I apologise to both the right hon. Gentleman and my right hon. and learned Friend that I was not present to hear their arguments—but I am troubled about the proposition because, although the right hon. Gentleman and other members of the Committee on his side have been enthusiastic about it in previous debates, I want to know what pressure there has been for advancing this cause.<br><br>
Jenkins went into the matter in some detail in 1962. Although certain advantages were gleaned from the American experience, this was coupled with the fact that in the United States very strict liabilities are imposed upon directors. Jenkins concluded that unless one were to advance contemporaneously along that route as well, the general proposition that even a small company
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 240</span>
should be able to purchase its own shares was not desirable.<br><br>
I have much sympathy with that view. As I have said, however, Jenkins pointed out that there appeared to be little or no evidence to suggest that there was any need for that course to be followed.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman limits his proposition to private companies. He is not now suggesting that public companies should develop along the same road. But even there, Jenkins observed that
<br><blockquote><p>"the relatively few witnesses who offered any evidence on this matter were almost unanimous in opposing the introduction of a general power for companies to buy their own shares."</p></blockquote>
There is in any case a considerable difficulty of principle in dividing this issue between private and public companies. Jenkins also observed, in paragraph 168:
<br><blockquote><p>"The power might occasionally be useful when a minority of the members of a small company whose shares were not readily marketable wished to retire from the company and the other members were unable or unwilling to buy their shares at a fair price"—</p></blockquote>
but he went on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"we doubt if such a power would often be exercised for this purpose since it would usually give rise to a surtax assessment in respect of past profits of the company still undistributed and, in cases where tax difficulties can be overcome, a quasi-purchase of the shares of the company can be, and in practice is, carried out by the machinery of a reduction of capital by repaying those shares at a premium."</p></blockquote>
Jenkins therefore came to the general conclusion that there was no justification for the proposition now being advanced by the right hon. Gentleman. Although there has been a considerable gap in years, I cannot see that the situation has materially changed. I should therefore like to know what pressure for a change in the law has been brought to the Minister's notice.<br><br>
I turn now to the other proposition advanced by the right hon. Member for Crosby, namely, that the situation should be developed by rules prescribed by the Secretary of State in a statutory instrument. I think that that is a very unsafe way of proceeding. We cannot amend a statutory instrument. This is a difficult and complex matter. I gathered that the Minister for Trade was arguing at our last sitting—before he reached the last minute, when he was obviously playing for time, as I know from my
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0136">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 241</span>
own experience Ministers are inclined to do when it is close on one o'clock—that it was a very difficult and complicated exercise, and I suspect that he was rejecting the thesis advanced by his right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby.<br><br>
At least, I hope that that is so, as I believe that it would be extremely unsafe, notwithstanding the precedents that the right hon. Gentleman sought to invoke, for the Minister to prescribe rules in this way. If they were unsatisfactory, all that one could then do would be to reject the draft statutory instrument outright and send it back. That, of course, is very unlikely with the party balance as it is. With the greatest respect to the right hon. Member for Crosby and to the hon. Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams), who are known to carry out their own quasi-rebellions from time to time, I doubt that that could be regarded as a course that should commend itself to the House of Commons.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
If there is to be any change in the law, therefore, it should be done in a Bill. I hope that the Under-Secretary will not tell us that he intends to introduce another huge set of amendments. The Committee is already plagued with a completely different Bill from that which was originally put before us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not "plagued" —we are delighted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, "plagued" is perhaps the wrong word. However, in a sense it is unfair to the Committee that we should be faced with a vast number of amendments at relatively short notice. The matter should have been dealt with properly in the first place. It was not, and now it is a botched-up affair. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not tell the Committee that he is to propose a huge set of further amendments which we shall have to consider. That is not a course which would commend itself to the Opposition. In any event, we have great reservations about the principle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I quite appreciate that Jenkins was not enthusiastic about the proposition that private companies
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 242</span>
—or, indeed, any companies—should acquire their own shares. However, in respect of private companies there is undoubtedly a desire that they should be able to deal with cases when it is difficult—particularly concerning the estate of a deceased person, but in many other matters—to help out if the shares are not readily marketable. I believe that that is perfectly good cause for an amendment such as that which I seek to make to clause 35.<br><br>
I turn to the point, which I believe Jenkins illustrated, that in the United States the liabilities on directors are much stricter than in this country. After the Bill has been put on the statute book, with all the 18 new clauses tabled by the Minister of State during the weekend, it will be just as strict on directors as is United States law.<br><br>
On the question of rules, I have proposed in the amendment that they should be in a draft instrument. It is certainly not unknown for a draft statutory instrument, when it has been published and laid, to receive comments from outside and inside the House and for it to be withdrawn and a further draft to be placed before the House. I can cite five cases in the past two years in which that was done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But the right hon. Gentleman will understand that we did not have a majority. It was easy for that to happen in the past two years, but is much less likely today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the hon. Gentleman said that I am quasi-rebellious. I may be revolting at times but I am not rebellious. I always try to be constructive. When drafts are put in front of us, I try to improve them rather than destroy them. Certainly, that would apply in the case of the rules that I have suggested in amendment No. 201.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt again, but it could well be that that matter would be developed not in a Committee of this sort, where the right hon. Gentleman has a significant influence, but on the Floor of the House, in which case his influence, though important, is less significant. The Government might well say that they want the rules as they stand rather- than wait for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0137">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 243</span>
them to be amended. Whatever the right hon. Gentleman or the Opposition might wish could come to nothing. That is the risk, not when we are dealing with the matter here but when it is dealt with on the Floor of the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me fall back on expediency. Had I merely put down in the amendment that this clause should not apply to a private company, the argument against me would have been that a private company would be wide open to buying up its own shares in any circumstances, with no rules to the game at all. The only way I could avoid that argument was either by drafting my own schedule of rules for the private company—which I do not believe a Back Bencher is called upon to do—or to take the practical way of saying that the Secretary of State must draw the rules. If the Minister says that he is not satisfied that these matters should go in rules, it is for the Government to put them in a schedule to the Bill.<br><br>
I am falling back on expediency, as the hon. Gentleman knows. We cannot, from the Back Benches, do more than lay the foundations for a detailed amendment of this sort. Amendment No. 199 lays those foundations.</span></p>

ACQUISITION OF SHARES IN A COMPANY BY COMPANY'S NOMINEE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 176, in page 44, line 28, at beginning insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"(1) Subject to subsection (4) below, where shares are issued to a nominee of a company mentioned in section 35(1) above or are acquired by a nominee of such a company from a third person as partly paid up, then, for all purposes the shares shall be treated as held by the nominee on his own account and the company shall be regarded as having no beneficial interest in them.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 244</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister for Trade dealt at length with this matter at our previous sitting. I shall speak only briefly.<br><br>
To reply to the question raised by the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) on where the pressure comes from, representations have been received from the Association of Independent Businesses, and—this may carry weight in the hon. Gentleman's mind—support for the proposed change has come from the Wilson committee on financial institutions.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Minister for Trade emphasised the need for consultation and careful preparation. He emphasised that in his view it would be better to make a change of this kind in a Bill. On that point I agree entirely with the points made by the hon. Member for Hackney, Central. I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends will take full account of what I believe to be wise advice given by my hon. Friend the Minister for Trade.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 2, Noes 9.</p>
<p><br><blockquote><p>(2) Subject as aforesaid".</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 177 and 178.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of these amendments is to remedy two weaknesses in the clause. The first point turns on the phrase presently in the Bill,
<br><blockquote><p>"nominee for the company alone".</p></blockquote>
What lies behind this phrase is the directive. In articles 18 to 24, which deal with various aspects of the acquisition by a company of its own shares, the directive assimilates acquisitions by the company itself with acquisitions by a person
<br><blockquote><p>"acting in his own name but on the company's behalf".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0138">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 245</span>
The phrase in the Bill
<br><blockquote><p>"nominee for the company alone"</p></blockquote>
is an attempt to express this idea, but it is clear that it is an unsuccessful attempt. It has been pointed out that a person may acquire shares and hold them on behalf of the company without the company having any knowledge of his actions.<br><br>
In such a case, it is possible to describe the acquirer as a
<br><blockquote><p>"nominee for the company alone".</p></blockquote>
The consequences of this under the present clause could be grave. If the shares were taken on subscription or were acquired partly paid up, the directors or the subscribers to the memorandum could, without any knowledge of the transaction on the part of the company, become liable to pay any sums due if the nominee for the company did not. That is clearly not sensible and not what the directive is after.<br><br>
I do not overlook the fact that, as drafted, the clause allows directors and subscribers to apply to the court for relief, but that is not a satisfactory answer. We should not force perfectly innocent people to apply to the court for relief from arbitrarily imposed liabilities.<br><br>
Where the Bill has gone wrong is that the nominees who should be covered are those nominated by or with the consent of the company to hold shares in the company on its behalf. When one concentrates on such a concept, the problem mentioned earlier, of a person acting as nominee for the company without the company being aware of it, is solved. Such clandestine behaviour does not bring the provisions of clause 36 into play.<br><br>
Furthermore, under the new approach, knowledge and consent of the company is the cornerstone. In such a case, there is no need to limit the Bill as it is presently limited to cases where the person is acting as nominee for the company alone. That limitation is an open invitation to avoidance, and if the company knows what is happening then it is not clear why directors or subscribers should avoid liability merely because someone else has a beneficial interest in those shares.<br><br>
The amendments proposed seek to define the nominee in the sense that I have described, and to do this we propose
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 246</span>
an apparently slight change but one which has the effect that we wish for. Instead of referring to a
<br><blockquote><p>"nominee for the company alone",</p></blockquote>
the amendments speak of a "nominee of the company".<br><br>
Thus, the latter phrase restricts the nominee to those cases where he can properly be described as a nominee of the company, with the necessary requirement that the company should be aware of what is going on.<br><br>
I now turn to the second weakness in the clause as it stands. Paragraph 2 of article 18 of the directive says that where a person acting on behalf of the company subscribes for shares, he shall be deemed to have subscribed for them on his own account—that is, the company is to have no beneficial interest in the shares. United Kingdom law presently establishes that such a person is primarily liable to pay for the shares and the company is not permitted to reimburse him. The same applies if he acquires partly paid shares in the company from a third person. However, United Kingdom law does not lay down any rule that the company has no interest in the shares, and therefore we fall short of the directive.<br><br>
The first amendment provides that in those cases where the clause applies, the shares will be treated as held by the nominee on his own account and the company shall be regarded as having no beneficial interest in them. I hope therefore that the Committee will welcome the amendments.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with the principle amendment in this group—amendment No. 180—which amends clause 37(1). In these amendments we have again moved from the term
<br><blockquote><p>"nominee for the company alone",</p></blockquote>
to "nominee of the company", for the reasons which I set out in discussion of the previous amendments.<br><br>
I start with clause 37(1)(<i>b</i>) as it stands. It was intended to have two distinct effects and unfortunately, the two issues have become confused. The first effect of clause 37(1)(<i>b</i>) is to maintain the rule in Castiglione's case. That decision established that a gift to the company of fully paid shares in that company could be validly accepted by a nominee of the company. The essential point is that it is a gift. The company does not provide consideration, so it does not fall foul of section 54 of the 1948 Act, which prohibits the provision of financial assistance by a company for the purpose of, or in connection with, the purchase or subscription of its own shares.<br><br>
There were no direct problems on that, and the case is still protected in subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) proposed in the amendment.<br><br>
11 a.m.<br><br>
I turn to the second intended effect of clause 37(1)(<i>b</i>) as drafted, which is where the problems arise. Clause 37(1)(<i>b</i>) is expressly limited to
<br><blockquote><p>"circumstances where the acquisition as a nominee is lawful".</p></blockquote>
Those words sought to exclude cases where the company was in breach of section 54 and had financed acquisitions of its own shares by third parties.<br><br>
The reason why such acquisitions were excluded was that it was thought that the company would not acquire any interest in the shares as a result of a transaction which involved a breach of section 54. That is where the problem starts. Section 54 deals not with the legality or otherwise of acquisitions, but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0140">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 249</span>
the methods by which they are financed. It may therefore be that the words in clause 37(1)(<i>b</i>) do not have the effect intended, as the acquisition may be lawful. Whatever the answer is to that difficult question, we face a Morton's Fork, where the bill as drafted fails to comply with the directive.<br><br>
A recent case decided by the Court of Appeal, Belmont Finance <i>v</i> Williams, reported in 1979 1 All England Law Reports at page 118, explained that section 54 was intended to protect creditors and therefore while the directors may be penalised for breach of the criminal provisions, the civil sanctions which the courts have developed will not be employed to the prejudice of the creditors. Therefore, the company may still have a beneficial interest in shares acquired with its funds by third parties. In the light of that recent decision, there must be a real possibility that the company could have a beneficial interest in such a case.<br><br>
In such a case, the directive requires that unless the shares are disposed of within one year, they must be cancelled. That is the effect of article 21. But whatever the effect of clause 37(1)(<i>b</i>), it cannot be disputed that the clause does not comply with the directive. If the words in clause 37(1)(<i>b</i>) have the effect of excluding acquisitions in breach of section 54, there is nothing in the clause to implement the directive. If the words do not have that effect, the clause applies, but therefore the company has three years under subsection (2) to dispose of the shares or its interest in them, not one year as required by the directive. That is the problem.<br><br>
The answer proposed in the amendments is to deal separately and specifically with the point at issue. Hence, the new paragraph (<i>c</i>) proposed in amendment No. 180.<br><br>
I turn to the other amendments, most of which fall rapidly into place. In place of the reference in subsection (2) and elsewhere to "three years", there is substituted "the relevant period". That is defined in the new subsection (9)(<i>b</i>) as three years for the present subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) and the new subsection (1)(<i>b</i>), but one year for the new paragraph (<i>c</i>). There are drafting amendments consequent upon the recasting of subsection (1). Into this category fall amendments Nos. 181, 182, 183, 185, 186, 187 and 188.<br><br>
That leaves amendment No. 179 and the first part of amendment No. 189. First,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 250</span>
amendment No. 179. In those cases where, under a transaction that contravenes section 54, the company acquires a beneficial interest in the shares, the provisions of clause 37 are to apply—that is disposal within one year, failing which cancellation.<br><br>
It is possible to imagine an overlap between clauses 36 and 37, and in such a case, it is necessary that clause 37 should prevail, since clause 36 would otherwise operate to destroy the beneficial interest of the company in the shares. This is the purpose of amendment No. 179.<br><br>
The first part of amendment No. 189 provides for the accounting treatment of shares held by, or on behalf of, the company. The treatment proposed is called for by article 22(i)(<i>b</i>) of the directive. The Bill as drafted does not deal with that, because it was thought that such accounting practice as exists in this rather out of the way spot would meet the directive. However, with the other changes proposed, we think that it would be best to state the role clearly in the Bill.<br><br>
I fear that this has been, necessarily, a lengthy explanation of certain complex changes, but in the light of what I have said I hope that the Committee will support the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not rise on the amendments, which my hon. Friend so ably put before the Committee, because he went on to clause 37. However, on clause 36 stand part I should like to ask some questions. First, why should the other subscribers be liable to purchase the defaulting subscriber's share? They may not be concerned in the proposition. They may know nothing about it, yet one of the subscribers is to hold his share for the benefit of the company. The other subscribers are put to the trouble of applying to the court for relief. Surely we should go after only the person who has some fault and not group a number of subscribers and label them with the fault of one, to the extent that they may become criminally liable and have to apply to the court for some relief.<br><br>
The same applies to the directors, although not quite so much to them as to the subscribers. It may be said that a director ought to know all about the transfer of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0141">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 251</span>
shares in the company, who was acquiring them and why. Even so I should have thought that it would be fair and would provide more justice to pursue the guilty director rather than to group him with all the other directors, some of whom could have had no knowledge of what was happening behind their backs.<br><br>
Secondly, if the other subscribers or other directors have to pay for these shares, do they acquire the shares? I cannot find in clauses 36 or 37 what happens to the shares when the non-defaulting subscribers and the non-defaulting directors have been called upon to pay those shares. Do they acquire them jointly? Do they split them up among themselves? What happens to them?<br><br>
We are told under clause 37 that something has to be done to the shares within a year. Does that mean that they are not vested in those who pay for them or that payment is made into the company and no consideration is given for those payments by the transfer of shares to those who pay?<br><br>
I have probably missed something in these two clauses that solves those problems, but I must admit ignorance about what will happen when subscribers or directors, who are quite innocent, have to pay for their defaulting colleagues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that it Would be right if I explained the good effect of clause 36 in replying to my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page). It gives effect to the provisions of articles 18(2) and 18(3) of the second directive. It provides that where a person who holds shares in a company, issued to him as a subscriber, as nominee for the company alone fails to pay them up, the other subscribers or, if he received them otherwise, the directors, are to be jointly and severally liable with him. It goes on to provide full relief at the discretion of the court where the other subscribers or directors have acted honestly and reasonably.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend asks why the other subscribers should be liable. If they do not know of the default they can apply for relief. The circumstances would be complicated, but the other subscribers could apply to the court for relief, so they would not be unfairly treated.<br><br>
Article 18(3) of the directive requires that the subscriber or director must prove that there is no fault on his part, so the directive puts the onus on the director or
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 252</span>
subscriber involved in that kind of transaction.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend also asked what would be the interest of a director or subscriber in the shares if he had, under the clause, to pay for them. That is a good practical question, and the answer is that the Bill does not attempt to deal with it. There could well be such a wide variety of factors to be considered, and legal and particularly equitable principles of some complexity, in which I know my right hon. Friend has a great interest, could be involved. So it seems far more satisfactory to leave such principles to the general law and not attempt to provide particular answers in the present Bill. I hope that my right hon. Friend will feel that that is a proper and practical answer.<br><br>
The Bill deals with the structure of companies and the pattern of share ownership, and the point that my right hon. Friend raises really concerns the more personal rights of a subscriber or director who may become involved in this situation. I believe it to be right that determination of matters of that kind would be better left to the courts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished at my hon. Friend's reply to that last point. Someone pays money which he is forced to pay under clause 36. He pays it in respect of some shares. The company pockets that money and gives nothing in return for it. There is nothing in general law that provides that if a person is forced under some provision in the Companies Acts he is to get shares in return.<br><br>
My hon. Friend says that we must leave that to the general law. I do not know what the general law is in that regard, and I am sure no one does. I do not know of any general law which provides that, in these circumstances, the payer would get the shares. It seems most unfair that if he is not at fault he gets nothing for his money.<br><br>
Let us take it one step further. The person seeks relief. Is he relieved completely of paying for those shares? The difficulty here is that clause 36(2) provides that
<br><blockquote><p>"If in proceedings for the recovery of any such amount …"</p></blockquote>
certain orders can be made by the court. Who takes those proceedings? I presume that it is the duty of the directors, so they take proceedings against themselves in order to get the money from themselves
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0142">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 253</span>
for the shares. We are getting into a Gilbertian situation.<br><br>
Does every subscriber or director who becomes liable under the clause have to apply to the court in order to get relief? Whoever takes proceedings for the recovery of the money, can they settle those proceedings on the basis that they will not collect the money from the person who is, prima facie, liable under the clause? Does it really mean that where the company—by that, I suppose, I mean the directors—is satisfied that the subscribers other than the one who acted, or even the one who acted by taking the share as nominee for the company—
<br><blockquote><p>"acted honestly and reasonably and that, having regard to all the circumstances of the case"</p></blockquote>
they ought to be excused from liability? I do not know whether that means the person who actually took the shares in the name of the nominee against whom action is taken for recovery of the money or whether it is those who are otherwise liable under the clause.<br><br>
I need to continue to investigate the details of the clause. To me, the clause is completely ridiculous. My hon. Friend must take it back and think again. I am not quibbling merely about the drafting of the clause. The whole principle behind it seems unthought-out, to use an awkward phrase. It has not been fully considered, and it must be considered again.</span></p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I always take a great deal of notice of what my right hon. Friend says about matters of this kind. But, with respect, I believe that he has used his considerable knowledge of all the difficulties that can apply in circumstances such as he has described and then required that many of those problems should be answered in the Bill.<br><br>
I do not agree with my right hon. Friend's view because it would not be possible to deal in the Bill with the multitude of circumstances that might apply in the kinds of cases to which he has referred. I submit that the structure of the Bill, and of this clause, as amended, in particular, provides a proper framework within which the difficulties mentioned by my right hon. Friend may be properly resolved.<br><br>
I emphasise that, in the circumstances
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 254</span>
described by my right hon. Friend, the issue is not between the subscribers and the company but between the subscriber and the nominee. I point out to my right hon. Friend that the equitable doctrine on resulting trusts comes into play. The position with regard to the ultimate ownership of the shares depends on all sorts of considerations, especially the knowledge of the subscriber at the time of the default. The position on compromising is more exactly the same position as under section 448 of the Companies Act 1948. That provides for relief for directors in a much wider range of circumstances. I am sure that my right hon. Friend will take account of the fact that provisions of the Companies Act 1948 have dealt with similar circumstances since that time.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend mentioned other subscribers and asked whether the company could settle the proceedings. There could be a settlement, provided that it was proper for the company to abandon the proceedings on the ordinary basis that it would not be profitable to pursue them. The existence of the defence is obvious and would be a highly relevant consideration.<br><br>
As I have explained, under the 1948 Act there has long been a provision similar to the clause and the amendments. I think that when my right hon. Friend has had longer to consider the purpose of the clause and the sensible way in which it has been amended, he will concede that it provides a workable structure for dealing with the situation. Considerations then arise between the subscriber and the nominee which are extra to the purpose of the clause. They would be resolved either in the courts or by way of settlement in the way that I have described.<br><br>
I hope that my right hon. Friend will give consideration to my argument. If; after further thought, he still has reservations about the matter, I shall, naturally, be prepared to take them into account. I should be glad to discuss them in detail with him. We could then consider the position for Report. In the present situation, I ask him to give further thought to the points that have been made and perhaps to give further time to an examination of the clause. I believe that it is reasonable to proceed on that basis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I make only one point. My hon. Friend said that the proceedings mentioned in the clause were
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0143">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 255</span>
between the nominee and the subscriber. The clause, however, refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"any such subscriber or director".</p></blockquote>
If one refers back a few lines, that can include all the other subscribers and all the other directors. As I read the clause, therefore, the proceedings may be taken against those who were not at fault, because the money can be recovered from them under subsection (1). As I read it, proceedings under subsection (2) may be proceedings to recover that money from anybody who may be liable for it.<br><br>
I shall not press the matter any further. But I say again to my hon. Friend that not only will I look at the clause again but I hope that he also will do so before Report.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Clause 36, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Stephen. On the last clause I refrained from going into a long debate about resulting trusts, although my hon. Friend almost enticed me to do so, because we are making fairly rapid progress. Over the weekend, however, no fewer than 18 new clauses have appeared on the Paper. I am delighted to see that you have not selected them this morning, Sir Stephen. However, if I continue to exercise self-discipline and restraint, we may well reach them. If that happens, perhaps you would consider adjourning the Committee, because we want to have "outsider dealings" with our advisers just as much as the Government want the clauses on insider dealing.<br><br>
In addition to asking whether you would consider an adjournment so that we are not called upon to debate those new clauses today, may I further ask that when we are called upon to consider them you will look kindly upon manuscript amendments, as I think that we shall be pressed right up to time on these matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Stephen. If that situation were to arise, the right hon. Gentleman's point of view might well receive some support from this side of the Committee. However, I think that I can probably set his mind at rest. Some of the honey referred to in last week's proceedings may well take on something of the flavour of bitter marmalade a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 256</span>
little later in the morning. That may protract our proceedings somewhat.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman for his remarks, and to the right hon. Gentleman for raising the point of order. I think, however, that the appropriate time to raise that point of order will be when we reach the new clauses rather than now.</span></p>

This is a simple drafting amendment. In the 1978 Bill the word "framed" occurred a number of times. In Committee my hon Friends the Members for Gloucestershire, South (Mr. Cope) and Maldon (Mr. Wakeham) rightly argued that the word was superfluous. It was accordingly deleted almost everywhere it occurred. This particular reference was overlooked. The word is still superfluous. The amendment therefore deletes it.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to raise a small point regarding the rubric to clause 37:
<br><blockquote><p>"Treatment of forfeited, etc., shares".</p></blockquote>
I am concerned about the word "etc". In the light of the Government amendments to the clause it is quite clear that it deals with a lot more than forfeited shares, and it is most misleading to have such a title. In fact, when I first read the Bill I skipped through clause 37 believing that it dealt only with forfeited shares, whereas it deals with something much more important. Therefore, although one cannot amend these rubrics, I recommend that my hon. Friend takes advice about a little wider rubric than that to tell us what the clause is about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise if my right hon.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 258</span>
Friend feels that the matter has not adequately been dealt with. I entirely accept his view that it should be dealt with adequately, and I shall try to see that that is done.</span></p>

CHARGES TAKEN BY PUBLIC COMPANIES ON OWN SHARES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 71, in page 47, line 18, after "credit", insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"or the bailment or (in Scotland) hiring of goods under a hire purchase agreement, or both,".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to widen the scope of the exception set out in clause 38(2)(<i>b</i>) to the operation of subsection (1) of the clause. Subsection (1) makes void all loans or other charges by a public company over its own shares. Clause 38 (2)(<i>b</i>) contains an exception for companies whose ordinary business includes the lending of money or consists of the provision of credit.<br><br>
The amendment would widen the scope of this exception to include other companies whose ordinary business consisted of the bailment or, in Scotland, hiring of goods under a hire-purchase agreement or either of these and the provision of credit.<br><br>
The second directive prohibits public companies from taking security over their own shares, but it permits an exception in the case of
<br><blockquote><p>"transactions concluded by banks and other financial institutions in the normal course of business".</p></blockquote>
Those are the words of article 24, paragraph 2.<br><br>
The reason for the amendment is that there could be doubt as to whether the clause as drafted provides an exception for companies whose ordinary business consists of providing hire-purchase finance. Such a company clearly comes within the exceptions allowed by the directive as a "financial institution". The amendment ensures that such companies are within the exception in subsection (2).</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This group of technical amendments is intended to clarify a point concerning accounting write-offs which was raised during the Committee stage of the 1978 Companies Bill and which has also been raised by commentators on this Bill.<br><br>
The amendments arise out of clause 39 (2), which provides that
<br><blockquote><p>"a company's profits available for distribution are its accumulated, realised profits so far as not previously utilised (whether by distribution, capitalisation or otherwise) less its accumulated, realised losses, so far as not previously written off."</p></blockquote>
As the subsection is drafted, it is possible that unrealised losses written off in the past could be deemed to have "utilised" realised profits. This is not the intention, because a company could thus be penalised for an accounting practice adopted when the rules provided for by the Bill did not apply. At the same time,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0146">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 261</span>
a company might be able to ignore realised losses written off against unrealised profits prior to enactment of the Bill.<br><br>
Accordingly, amendment No. 204 provides for the words "or otherwise" to be deleted. This makes clear that realised profits can be "utilised" only by distribution or capitalisation and not by writing off losses.<br><br>
Amendment No. 205 relates the words "so far as not previously written off" specifically to losses eliminated by a reduction or reorganisation of capital.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
The further amendments in the group are, in general, consequential upon the first two. However, they also provide necessary additional clarification. In particular, No. 216 provides that where a company's articles permit the company to capitalise the sums available for distribution, the company may, unless the articles provide to the contrary, capitalise not only the sums available for distribution under part III of the Bill but also unrealised profits. But for this provision, a company which had adopted paragraph 128 of table A in the first schedule to the Companies Act 1948, or something similar, would in future be unable to capitalise unrealised profits without changing its articles.<br><br>
Amendment No. 218 makes more explicit the circumstances in which a redemption of preference shares and a payment of any premiums on the redemption are not to be regarded as distributions under part Ill of the Bill. Amendment No. 219 defines "capitalisation"
<br><blockquote><p>"in relation to any profits of a company"</p></blockquote>
and amendment No. 220 explicitly provides that reference to profits and losses are references to profits and losses whenever made.<br><br>
I consider that this group of technical amendments will serve to remove any uncertainty which has been created by part III of the Bill. I ask the Committee to agree to their adoption.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has referred to the amendments grouped with amendment No. 204 as technical amendments. The group is very large and the amendments refer to a number of clauses, including clauses 39 and 40. It is the two amendments to clause 40—Nos. 207 and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 262</span>
208—which particularly concern me. As I read them, these amendments alter the Bill as drafted in far more than a technical respect.<br><br>
I shall try to give a far from technical example. Let us assume that, while he was yet a prospective candidate for Birmingham, Hall Green, my hon. Friend was the chairman of a small company in the area. Let us assume that he had his portrait painted at that time—at the expense of the company, of course. The expense was only 50 guineas, and that was entered in the balance sheet as an asset of the company.<br><br>
Since then, my hon. Friend has become famous as a Minister of the Crown. The painter also has become famous. The painting is now worth not 50 guineas but £½ million. The difference between the 50 guineas and the £1 million is unrealised profit. But during the years, as the picture has increased in value, that unrealised profit has been transferred from the balance sheet to the profit and loss account, and that has made the profit and loss account look pretty good—so good that nice dividends have been paid out of it.<br><br>
The present directors of that company have now, of course, read the second directive from the EEC. They have read the draft Bill. They entirely agree with the principle that in future one should not pay dividends out of unrealised profits, and in future they will not do so. However much the picture may increase in value, they will not use that increase in value for the purpose of paying out dividends.<br><br>
I do not think that there is any dispute about that. I do not dispute the principle of the clause or the principle in the second directive, although since the Dumbulla Valley Tea Company case in 1961—the first clear statement of the law—the courts have said that to use unrealised profits for the purpose of paying dividends was quite legal. So since 1961 the imaginary company with the portrait of my hon. Friend has been doing something which has not been in any way unlawful. But in future it will be unlawful. I accept that.<br><br>
But now my hon. Friend tables an amendment which I can only take to mean that the company must not pay any more dividends until it has paid back into reserve all the moneys which it has paid out in dividends since it started doing so on these unrealised profits. That is how I read amendment No. 207.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0147">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 263</span>
Clause 40(2) starts:
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of this section the un- distributable reserves of a company are"—</p></blockquote>
Then paragraph (<i>c</i>) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"the amount by which the company's accumulated, unrealised profits so far as not previously utilised exceed its accumulated, unrealised losses, so far as not previously written off".</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 207 seeks to delete the words
<br><blockquote><p>"exceed its accumulated, unrealised losses, so far as not previously written off"</p></blockquote>
and to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"by and capitalisation of a description to which this paragraph applies exceed its accumulated, unrealised losses, so far as not previously written off in a reduction or re-organisation of capital duly made".</p></blockquote>
So it applies only if the reserves have been written off
<br><blockquote><p>"in a reduction or reorganisation of capital duly made".</p></blockquote>
In my example the reserves were disposed of by way of dividend, not by way of capitalisation. It seems to me that they will all have to be paid back before any further dividend is paid. At least, that is the interpretation placed upon it by a number of bodies outside this Committee which have put the case to me in the technical language which my hon. Friend used this morning, which I have endeavoured to translate into something picturesque. Perhaps "picturesque" is a correct term to use. That sort of example, I think, shows the difficulties that may arise with amendment No. 207.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend can give me an answer. I may be reading too much into the clause, but certainly there are people outside the Committee who are reading into the clause the sort of situation that I have described.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for the way he told the story of my picture. I think that 50 guineas for a portrait in Birmingham in 1965 is rather excessive. Fifty bob would have been more in line.<br><br>
I agree that one of the effects of the Bill will be to require a company which has previously distributed unrealised profits to cover those distributions by realised profits before any further dividends can be paid. That was also a requirement of the 1978 Bill, although the present amendment's seek to clarify the position. It is a consequence of article 33 of the fourth directive, which requires any upward revaluations of fixed assets—that is,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 264</span>
unrealised profits—to be transferred to a valuation reserve which will not be available for distribution until realised. That requirement also applies to revaluation surpluses existing at the time the directive comes into force, unless the surpluses have been capitalised.<br><br>
I understand that there should not be many cases in which a company has already distributed a reserve arising from a previous revaluation, but where this has been done in the past the fourth directive requires any deficit arising to be made good before any further distribution can be made.<br><br>
In these circumstances, therefore, I cannot give any undertaking that the Government would further consider the amendment of part III of the Bill to remove that requirement. This is a complicated accounting matter which my officials have discussed recently with a number of interested companies. If any company which is particularly affected by these proposals would like to have further consultations with us, we shall be glad to meet it. However, in reply to my right hon. Friend's question, I can only say that the basic reason is that this requirement is one established by the fourth directive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although I used the example of a moveable asset, this aspect affects companies holding property more than any others, perhaps. Certainly, the increase in the value of property over the years and the use of that against the development of the property—the transfer to the profit and loss account against the unrealised losses which are put in the profit and loss account for the expenses of development—affects a lot of companies. It may be quite disastrous to some companies which, in the course of development have to put back into reserve money which has gone out in dividends based on unrealised profit.<br><br>
Although it is unrealised profit, when the value of property, particularly land and buildings held by a property company, is part of the business of such a company and part of the dealings of the company to which the shareholders and the public look carefully, the increase in value of properties which the company may acquire for the purpose of development or for holding may be one of the reasons why one invests in a property company. One may well invest if such a company is wise in buying property, in holding and develop-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0148">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 265</span>
ing property which increases substantially in value. In previous years there has been nothing wrong in using those unrealised profits in paying out dividends.<br><br>
Although it is difficult to interpret articles 32 and 33 of the directive, I should not myself have thought that they require retrospective legislation to this extent. It may be retrospective for many years Where do we cease going back to see when dividends were paid out of unrealised profits? It will cause considerable difficulty, and not only in accountancy; this is not just an accountancy matter It may cause considerable practical difficulties in cash flow, particularly for property companies which are developing their property.<br><br>
I have previously declared my interest, Sir Stephen, in being a director of a property company. I draw on that knowledge to speak on this occasion. Certainly, I accept my hon. Friends' offer to talk further with any companies which will suffer by the retrospective effect of the clause. As my hon. Friend has said, there have already been discussions. I thank him for making that possible, but I think that one must talk a little further about it and see that we do not unnecessarily have what I think the House detests—retrospective legislation which harms the citizen.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) for what he said in the closing stages of his speech.

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This clause deals with the distribution of dividends in public companies and the restrictions on the distribution of a public company's assets. Therefore, it is appropriate to raise at this point a matter of concern that was raised in another place and indeed, in Committee on the Labour Government's Bill. My purpose in so doing is to glean some indication of the Government's legislative intentions, if any.<br><br>
I refer to the desirability, as we on this side see it, of making legislative provision whereby political expenditure of public companies should be made out of a political fund, comparable to that relating to trade unions, which gives to shareholders in public companies rights comparable to those which apply to individual members of trade unions in respect of donations or expenditure out of such political funds. The Opposition's view is that that would be an equitable approach.<br><br>
I do not intend to debate the merits at length on this occasion because that has already been done elsewhere. What I wish to ascertain from the Government is whether they have any proposals, as we had, to introduce provisions to that effect in a separate Bill. Are they considering such an introduction in the 1981 Bill, or are they prepared to countenance the possibility of doing so in a separate piece of legislation?<br><br>
I recognise that this is not the best Bill for the proposals I have in mind, but I must tell the Minister that if he is not forthcoming with a satisfactory response we shall have no alternative but to come back
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0149">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 267</span>
to this matter on Report. It is intolerable that the inequitable difference between the treatment of shareholders and the treatment of trade unionists in such a matter should continue. I do not propose to take the matter any further unless I am provoked later this morning—which is always a possibility. I merely want to know the hon. Gentleman's response to what I and, I am sure, my hon. Friends consider a reasonable point to raise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Stephen. May I ask you to rule on whether discussion of that point is relevant to the clause which, as I understand it, deals with the mechanics, and the mechanics only, of distributions made by companies?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) spoke briefly and what he said has some relevance to the clause. Otherwise, I should have ruled it out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In brief reply to the hon. Gentleman, I wish to make clear that we have no plans to introduce a measure of the type mentioned. He knows that this matter was debated at great length in Committee last February. We maintain that there is no proper comparison between companies and trade unions in the matter upon which he dwelt. It is a subject on which the Government has no plans to introduce such legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ernie Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Speaking as one who was a trade union official with responsibility for dealing with 900,000 members who paid a political levy, I have in mind that those members were controlled by law with regard to their contributions to the union and the political levy that was set aside. As the Committee may know, members were allowed to contract out of paying the political levy, and if they did not like the Labour Party they contracted out. In the individual union of which I speak, there were 300,000 in total. In trade unions generally, there were probably 200,000 a year. Such people state that they do not wish to contribute to a particular party and therefore do not want to subscribe.<br><br>
We in the trade unions say not that a member who does not want to pay the political levy should leave the union or leave his job but he should have the right
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 268</span>
to contract out and still retain his job and his position in the union. I cannot see why a shareholder should not be in the same position, with the right to say "I do not like the Tory Party so I will withdraw from making any political payment whatever to that party, but I retain my membership of the company".<br><br>
Large sums of money are involved; it is not a small matter. About £1,400,000 was contributed by companies to the Tory Party and other associated bodies, and they are likely to give about £2½ million next year in the same way to the same organisations. There are hundreds of millions of pounds in public companies that are distributed—the clause deals with the distribution of companies' profits and assets—and these could be transferred to a political party. Our point is that there should be the same right for shareholders to contract out. It should be made compulsory for a company to enable a shareholder to contract out from making these political payments and still retain membership of the company.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the Minister does not want to argue the merits of the issue in detail now. Neither do I. But I want to rebut his assertion that the two matters are not comparable. He cannot ride off with it on that basis. There is a glaring inequity, and it ought to be cured. We feel that as he is not disposed, as he has now categorically stated, to entertain a separate Bill, or the possibility of bringing this issue within the next Companies Bill—we are grateful to him for making the position abundantly plain, which was helpful—we shall have to consider our position on Report. We can see no possibility, other than by an amendment to the Bill, of curing the disease of which I have spoken.<br><br>
The problem we face today—I am entitled, I feel, to put it this way—is that we do not know from one sitting to the next what new amendments the Government will introduce, and I do not think that they know themselves. So we are entitled to ask whether there are to be any amendments during the Committee stage. My right hon. and hon. Friends and I will want to consider the implications of what the hon. Gentleman has said. We shall want to consider the appropriateness of the amendment moved in other places to see whether that would fit in on Report—I believe that it may—but I give the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0150">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 269</span>
hon. Gentleman fair warning that we shall return to this matter, subject to the permission of the Chair, on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman will accept that my recollection of the last Companies Bill proceedings was that an amendment moved in the terms suggested, namely, that shareholders should have a similar right of contracting out, was seen in discussion to have absolutely penal consequences upon those shareholders. I believe that the previous Government accepted that the amendment proposed then to cover these points were inappropriate and wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. That amendment, moved, I believe, by my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo), was, in the Labour Government's view, deficient. We spent a considerable time examining that proposal and eventually concluded that it was not an amendment that readily fitted into the Bill. But I believe that there are other possible amendments.<br><br>
I should have much preferred the Minister to say "We consider this to be an inequitable situation that should not persist and we shall propose a separate Bill". I should have gone along with that. But as he has not done so, we must perforce come back to looking at ways in which the Bill now before us might be amended. I believe that a satisfactory amendment can be produced.</span></p>

<p>No. 211, in page 49, line 32, leave out from beginning to "paying".—[<i>Mr. Eyre.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to refer to the Secretary of State's power to make regulations under subsection (8), and to subsections (9) and (10). These subsections are riddled with such phrases as "as in his opinion", or "if it appears to him".<br><br>
By subsection (8)
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by regulations made by statutory instrument—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(<i>a</i>) prescribe the form … "—</p></blockquote>
and so on. The subsection then states that he may give orders to directors
<br><blockquote><p>"to furnish him with such returns as in his opinion will enable him to determine".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, the Secretary of State does not have to lay down in the statutory instrument exactly what information he wants. This may put directors in considerable difficulty if they are suddenly confronted by the Secretary of State saying "In my opinion you ought to tell me this or that".<br><br>
Subsection (9) then stipulates that the Secretary of State, despite what he says in the statutory instrument, may require anything that, in his opinion, will enable him to make a determination as in subsection 8(<i>b</i>).<br><br>
Under subsection (10) the Secretary of State may revoke the certificate given to the company if it appears to him that certain conditions no longer exist. If the company takes the matter to court and claims that the Secretary of State has wrongly revoked the certificate and, in short, killed the company, then, because it appears to the Secretary of State that the company no longer complies with certain conditions it will be unable to claim that the Secretary of State is wrong. He merely has to say that "it appeared to me" that such is the case, or "in my opinion" it was so-and-so. If he honestly reached that opinion or it honestly appeared to him, the complainant will have no case to put to the court.<br><br>
I do not expect to succeed in persuading my hon. Friend. It is, perhaps, one of my favourite hobbies to seek to protect the House from members of the Executive. The Executive will always wish in such cases to apply an opinion without having the House or the courts test it.<br><br>
I should like these subsections to be far more definite. We should lay down in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0151">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 271</span>
the Bill what the Secretary of State must put in the statutory instrument. We should not give him powers to avoid it as we have by, in one subsection, stipulate that he must put regulations in legislation and, in another, say that he can do anything outside those regulations.<br><br>
There must also be some form of appeal against revocation of the certificate. An appeal is useless under subsection (10) as it stands.<br><br>
Finally, I am not sure how a director realises that the Secretary of State's requirements have not been satisfied when what the requirements are is a matter for the Secretary of State's opinion. But if a director so realises, in 14 days he has to report the fact to the Secretary of State. If he does not do so, he is a criminal and faces substantial penalties under subsection (12).<br><br>
These subsections are a gross encroachment by the Executive both on the legislative powers of the House and on the courts.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has developed a powerful case. He has certainly affected my mind. We shall consider these provisions again. We shall consider withdrawing them and replacing them by an objective criterion. I hope that we shall be able to develop a form which will be more acceptable to my right hon. Friend. I am grateful to him for the effective way in which he has drawn the attention of the Committee to some less desirable parts of the clause.<br><br>
It may be helpful to the Committee if I explain that the Government intend to table other substantial amendments to this clause on Report.<br><br>
Clause 41 takes advantage of a derogation in the second directive obtained by the United Kingdom on behalf of investment trust companies. It deals with a problem which could arise if the capital maintenance rule in clause 40 were applied to investment trust companies. If such a company had invested substantial sums in shares which had since fallen in value, the net assets could fall below cost and thus below the aggregate of the called-up share capital and undistributable reserves, and the company would therefore be unable to distribute.<br><br>
Furthermore, an investment company which failed to distribute would lose
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 272</span>
special privileges under tax legislation regarding capital gains tax liability.<br><br>
Clause 41 applies different rules to investment companies in order to overcome this problem. However, the derogation in the second directive goes somewhat wider than the definition of an investment trust company in the Income and Corporation Taxes Act. This has given rise to certain investment companies which are not investment trust companies asking whether they might be permitted to qualify as investment companies under clause 41.<br><br>
As presently drafted, clause 41 defines an investment company as a listed public company which complies with certain requirements laid down in the directive and which has been certified as an investment company by the Secretary of State. Additionally, the clause empowers the Secretary of State to make, by order,
<br><blockquote><p>"conditions as to the conduct of business"</p></blockquote>
of investment companies.<br><br>
The clause as drafted therefore envisages a continuing role for my Department in issuing certificates and in monitoring companies to which certificates have been given. As members of the Committee are well aware, the Government intend to reduce the functions carried out by the public sector. We do not wish to create new responsibilities for civil servants. My Department will not be able to provide extra staff to carry out adequately the new functions envisaged by the clause. We shall put forward on Report amendments which achieve a simpler administrative solution.<br><br>
Our intention is that clause 41 should be amended to secure the derogation provided for by the directive specifically in respect of those investment trust companies for which derogation was obtained. This will be achieved largely by reference to the criteria in section 359, as amended, of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970, which defines an investment trust.<br><br>
There will be no certification procedure and it will be for the directors of an investment company, in conjunction with their professional advisers, to decide whether the company meets the criteria. Furthermore, a company which does meet the criteria will have the option of making a distribution on the basis of either the asset liability ratio test provided for in clause 41 or the capital maintenance test under clause 40.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 273</span>
As I stated earlier, there may be investment companies that are not investment trust companies meeting all the criteria laid down in the Income and Corporation Taxes Act which nevertheless might wish to qualify as investment companies under clause 41. Therefore, our intended reconstruction of clause 41 will provide a power whereby the Secretary of State may, by statutory instrument, prescribe alternative conditions for companies which are not investment trust companies.<br><br>
However, 1 must emphasise that any alternative conditions could not allow companies to obtain investment company status if they do not meet the requirements attached to the derogation in article 15 of the second directive, and that new categories of investment company will be permitted only if it is considered to be in the public interest to extend the scope of clause 41.<br><br>
We intend to publish our new proposals for clause 41 and to consult interested parties about the new proposals before they are put down as Government amendments on Report. As I have indicated, the effect of the amendments will be to simplify the administrative procedures now contained in the clause, to provide greater flexibility of dividend regime for the investment companies, to provide a clear definition of investment trust companies, and to provide means whereby other corn-panics within the scope of the directive's derogation may obtain investment company status if there are sound reasons for their doing so.</span></p>

REALISED PROFITS OF INSURANCE COMPANY WITH LONG TERM BUSINESS</div> <!-- title -->

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 42 provides that the amount transferred to the profit and loss account of an insurance company from the surplus on its long-term business shall be deemed to be a realised profit. However, as the clause is drafted, there is a very slight risk of double counting the realised losses when all profits and losses of the company are netted off under clause 39 to establish the overall distributable profit for the year.<br><br>
Furthermore, the clause deals only with a surplus on the fund and the exceptional case of a deficit is not catered for. The redrafting of subsection (1) meets both of these technical points by providing: (<i>a</i>) that any profit or loss arising in the long term business shall be left out of account for the purposes of a distribution; and (<i>b</i>) that any deficit on the long term business shall be treated as a realised loss. The last three amendments are consequential upon the first and are drafting points only.<br><br>
Clause 42 meets difficulties created for insurance companies in relation to their life business by the introduction of the concept of "realised profits" in clause 39(2). Insurance companies distribute to their shareholders out of a surplus arising
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0153">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 275</span>
on their long-term business which cannot readily be identified as "realised profits", and the clause enables insurance companies to treat the surplus as realised profit.<br><br>
The Life Offices Association is satisfied with the principle contained in clause 42 but has raised two technical points which are met by the first amendment in this group.<br><br>
First, the association considered that there was a possible risk of realised losses in the long-term business of insurance companies being taken into account again at the level where all profits and losses of the company are netted off under clause 39 to establish the overall distributable profit for the year. The Government accept that any possible risk, no matter how slight, is undesirable, and it is eliminated by the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"and, subject to the foregoing, any profit or loss arising in that business shall be left out of account for those purposes"</p></blockquote>
in the proposed new subsection (1).<br><br>
Second, the clause deals only with a surplus. It does not cater for the unlikely possibility of a deficit. It is right that the clause should cover all possible eventualities and the redrafted subsection (1) meets this point by providing that a deficit in the long-term business shall be treated as a realised loss.<br><br>
Clause 42 has been formulated in close consultation with the Life Offices Association, which is satisfied that this group of amendments meets the technical points which have been raised.</span></p>

We have now reached part IV, and I wish to refer to the amendments which have largely been prompted by the comments of the Law Society and the Bar on the clause when it formed part of the 1978 Companies Bill. They suggested that the new power set out in subsection (1), which will make it intra verse for companies to provide for employees, could be defective because decisions under it could be taken only in accordance with the best interests of the company, and it is possible to envisage circumstances where the company is about to cease trading when a provision for employees would no longer be in the interests of the company as a whole.<br><br>
This is even more the case for a company in liquidation which has taken no prior decision regarding provision for employees. Since the company is no longer a going concern, a provision for employees would clearly be inconsistent with the interests of members.<br><br>
Therefore, subsection (2) explicitly enables the power provided for in subsection (1) to be exercised even when it may not be in the best interests of the company. It means that the ruling in Parke <i>v.</i> <i>Daily News</i> will be effectively reversed because, taken in conjunction with the rest of the clause, it will enable the power to make provision for employees to be exercised by directors or, in the case of a company after the commencement of winding up, by the liquidator, with the sanction of a majority of the members, when to make such provision would reduce or be likely
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0155">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 279</span>
to be reduce the amounts available to members. It also has the effect that directors' actions in providing for emplayers would be proof against cases brought, as in Parke<i>v. Daily News,</i> on the basis that such provision amounted to a fraud on the minority.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
Subsection (3) provides that the exercise of the power shall be subject to a resolution of the directors, if so laid down in the articles or the memorandum, or, if not so provided for, at least to an ordinary resolution of the company—that is, a vote by a simple majority at a general meeting.<br><br>
However, subsection (3) is entirely without prejudice to the provisions of the articles for a more rigorous control, or any other conditions—for example, separate rules for the various classes of share- holders. The subsection requires that sanction shall be sought from the members whose assets will be made available to the employees. It also has the effect of making it very difficult for unscrupulous directors to vote moneys for themselves <i>qua</i> employees. Such an action would probably enable a case of fraudulent conversion to be brought.<br><br>
The remaining subsections embody the response to other suggestions from the Law Society and the Bar, without which the clause would not be effective in a case where the company has gone, or is about to go, into liquidation.<br><br>
Under section 302 of the Companies Act 1948, the assets of a company which has gone into voluntary liquidation be- come subject to a statutory trust to be applied, first, in satisfaction of the creditors, and then to be distributed among the members according to their rights and interests in the company.<br><br>
It has been argued that a liquidator could not, consistent with the provisions of section 302, make gratuitous provision for the employees in accordance with clause 46.<br><br>
Subsection (4) deals with a case where the company decides to make provision for employees under clause 46 and goes into liquidation before it has given effect to that decision. In such a case, sub- section (4) empowers the liquidator to give effect to the company's decision and to make the payments to the employees which have been decided upon.<br><br>
We consider, however, that it is also desirable to make provisions for the case
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 280</span>
where no decision has been made to make payments to employees under clause 46 before winding up but where it is subsequently decided that it would be desirable to do so. An example of this is where the shareholders discover, after liquidation, that, contrary to their previous expectations, there are sums available for this purpose. Accordingly, subsection (5) provides for the members to take a decision whether any return to them should be used to provide for employees.<br><br>
Such a decision may be taken only by the company, at least by ordinary resolution, and only after the discharge by the liquidator of all the debts of the company—that is, not until the liquidator has a surplus to return to the members. That takes into account the fact that members can take decisions only in the light of the facts of any return available to them. It will also have the effect of preventing the liquidator becoming involved in any pressure that may be brought to bear on members during the course of the liquidation. The liquidator will be involved only to the extent that he will make payments in accordance with the views of the members.<br><br>
Subsection (6) replaces the tailpiece of the present subsection (1). It makes clear that payments under section 302, whether by the company as a going concern—as in subsection (6)(<i>a</i>)—or by the liquidator in the case of a company winding up—as in subsection (6)(<i>b</i>)—may be made only out of sums which would otherwise be available for distribution to the shareholders. Thus, there can be no question of payments being made which would prejudice or undermine the position of creditors. The claims of creditors must be provided for first. Payments to employees under the clause can be made only out of the surplus funds which would otherwise go to the shareholders.<br><br>
While very unlikely, it is possible for the power to be exercisable in a compulsory liquidation as well as a voluntary one. Subsection (7) makes clear that in such a case the power to make payments under the clause is, like the powers of the liquidator, subject to the control of the court.<br><br>
Subsection (8) meets the specific point raised by the Law Society by providing that the provisions in subsections (4) and (5) override the statutory trust in section 302 of the 1948 Act.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0156">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 281</span>
These amendments therefore ensure that the intention of the clause to reverse the ruling in Parke<i> v. Daily News</i>—that provision for employees in circumstances of cessation of business is ultra vires to the company—is capable of being applied in all appropriate circumstances. I hope that the Committee will welcome the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are getting a little close to the bitter marmalade to which I referred earlier. I am not in the habit of inspecting the mouths of horses which I am given, particularly on my birthday. On the face of it, this is an attractive provision. It provides for appropriate payments to employees even if the power to make those payments is not otherwise available to the company.<br><br>
The amendment appears to polish the jewel yet further. It makes clear that the ruling in Parke <i>v. Daily News</i> will no longer be law and so, even if it is not necessarily in the best interests of the company, those payments may be made. The Opposition are grateful for the proposals in subsections (4) to (8). We are grateful also to the Law Society and Senate for pointing out what would otherwise be gaps in the provisions.<br><br>
But, unless I am being more than usually obtuse, it seems that what is being offered is not quite as dramatic as we were originally led to believe. On Second Reading, the Minister of State promised this amendment to clause 46 to deal with the problem arising out of Parke<i> v Daily News.</i> He reminded us—although we have to extend the implications—that the real problem in company law at present is that employees are not members of the company. Someone who has devoted 50 years of his working life to the service of a company is not a member, whereas someone who heard the name of the company for the first time last week and picked up a bundle of shares is a member. That is where the problem arises.<br><br>
In the light of subsection (3), it transpires that this power can be used only in certain circumstances. Subsection (3)(<i>b</i>) provides that, where the memorandum or articles authorise the power to be used by a resolution of the directors, it can be used. As I understand it, that confines it to the existing law. Subsection (3)(<i>c</i>) provides that if the memo-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 282</span>
randum or articles require something more stringent than an ordinary resolution, something more stringent will continue to be required. Therefore, the only extension seems to be in subsection (3)(<i>a</i>) which provides that, if it is not otherwise within the powers of the company, it will in effect be brought within those powers if there is an ordinary resolution of the company.<br><br>
An ordinary resolution of the company means a resolution of the shareholders, because they are members. It has nothing to do with the employees because they are not members. So at the end of the day the employees will benefit from assets which might otherwise have gone to the shareholders, only if the shareholders agree. I am not suggesting that shareholders as a class are notoriously mean or unfair. It would be as silly to generalise about shareholders as it would be to generalise about any other large class of people. But I am not sure that the employees will be thrilled to discover that they can benefit in that way only if the people who would otherwise benefit agree. It means, virtually, that employees will either not benefit at all or they will benefit from what is almost an act of charity.<br><br>
I hope that my view of the matter does not appear churlish. I realise that some safeguards are needed, and I understand the danger to which the hon. Gentleman adverted—that we wish to prevent directors from voting themselves as employees part of the assets which would otherwise be distributed to the shareholders. But, surely, that could be dealt with by saying that they must not do it. We do not require anything as complicated as these provisions which, in effect, deliver the interests of the employees into the hands of the people who would otherwise benefit.<br><br>
If I have misapprehended the matter, I shall be happy to hear the hon. Gentleman's further comments. But I am bound to say that at the moment the Opposition are a little troubled. We waited to hear the Government's comments on the subsection hut, unless their further comments allay our fears, we may have to reconsider the position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall attempt to reply briefly to the right hon. and learned Gentleman. There are admitted difficulties in cases of this kind, depending, of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0157">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 283</span>
course, on the amount of assets available. The right hon. and learned Gentleman will see that we have gone a considerable way towards ensuring that if assets are available there is an opportunity for the members to make provision for the employees. I emphasise that it is in no way a charitable approach. The right hon. and learned Gentleman used that word.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I was even less than usually articulate. I did not suggest that the Government were being charitable. I suggested that if the receipt of any advantage by the employees depended upon the assent of those who would otherwise benefit, it was equivalent to putting the employees in the position of receiving charity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I misunderstood the right hon. and learned Gentleman. It is true that the benefit could be transferred to the employees only at the expense of the members.<br><br>
The decision in Parke <i>v. Daily News</i> needed to be reversed because it was held in that case that the company could not decide: it was unable to make a decision, even as a matter of charity, if one wants to use that word. The company could not make a payment to employees. The situation is thus considerably improved, because the company, subject, of course, to the agreement of the members, and also without detriment to the creditors in certain circumstances, is now able to make the kind of decision that would have been right in the case of Parke<i> v. Daily News.</i> A subsection of this nature cannot solve all the problems of the world or ensure that assets are available. But the situation is now improved, because the members of the company are now better able to make a decision than they were before that case.<br><br>
I am advised that subsection (3)(<i>b</i>) is not an extension. If the majority, or the directors, approve a provision which is not in the interests of the company as a whole, under the present law the minority would have a remedy under an earlier case. We have abolished that remedy. We have provided for a democratic decision of the members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the handwriting in his Department has not improved.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 284</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Either the handwriting has deteriorated, or my eyesight is diminishing. On occasion, I find it difficult to follow the train of thought.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
I return to the assertion that the situation is substantially improved in that the members of the company are enabled to make a decision that would benefit the employees. Prior to the introduction of the clause that would not have been the case. Therefore, we should recognise that progress is being made by these provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I compliment my hon. Friend on the way in which he has devised subsection (3) of the amendment. I do not see how the decision could have been made in any other way. I understand from the Opposition that it might be suggested that the employees themselves vote on this or have some power by resolution to make such a decision. But one is merely following ordinary company law here. An ordinary resolution of the company decides this matter, unless it be within the power of the directors by resolution, or by a particular type of resolution is required.<br><br>
Points made to me by people outside the Committee show that their concern is to ensure that the creditors are not prejudiced. Throughout his speech on this amendment, my hon. Friend made that point. But, surely, there must be one case in which the creditors may be prejudiced, that is, when the directors decide to make such a payment shortly before the company goes into liquidation.<br><br>
Under subsection (4) the liquidator has to carry out the decision that the directors made before liquidation. I am not quite sure how the creditors are protected in that case. I believe that my hon. Friend made a point of this, but I must have missed it and was probably thinking of the previous sentence at the time. It seems clear that in subsection (4) the directors can decide to make a payment of this sort in order to avoid the rights of creditors and then go into liquidation. The liquidator would then be obliged to carry out that decision of the directors. Will my hon. Friend clarify that matter?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The substantial answer to my right hon. Friend is that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0158">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 285</span>
liquidator would not be in a position to obey the ordinary resolution of the company and to allocate this benefit to the employees unless it had become absolutely clear that a surplus was available from the assets and that all the debts had been duly and properly discharged. The power of the members to make payment to the employees—and the power of the liquidator to follow such instructions—can only follow the complete discharge of any liabilities to the creditors. The payment can be made only at the expense of surplus assets after the creditors have received complete satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for setting out the Government's answer to my questions. I give due credit to the Government—I nearly said "give the devil his due", but that would be disrespectful to the Government—for what they have done here. I accept that previously the company could not have made provision for its employees when that was not in the interests of the company, even if the members had so decided. I follow, too, that the majority of shareholders will now be able to vote to make such provision, even if the minority object. For those blessings we are grateful.<br><br>
It is not, however, very persuasive to say that the position is better now than it was if it was manifestly unfair before.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) asked how we want it decided, and who should decide. There are circumstances where, speaking for myself, I should prefer the matter to be decided by the directors rather than by the bulk of the shareholders who probably will not have spent a great deal of their time reflecting on a particular loyalty to the company. They probably have not had much to do with the company, their connection in many cases having been confined to receiving their dividends at appropriate intervals.<br><br>
In those circumstances, there might be a case for saying that it is better to leave the decision to the directors, but I do not wish to commit the Opposition to any particular solution to the problem today. I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's explanation. If the right hon. Member for Crosby is troubled by our
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 286</span>
attitude, he can take it that, naturally, we agree that the creditors have to be protected, and in the circumstances we are content to reflect further on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the right hon. and learned Gentleman for what he said in the early stages of his speech. In response to his comment that it would probably be better for the directors rather than the members to decide the matter, I should emphasise that it is much more democratic that the decision should be made by members of the company. I think that, on reflection, he will agree that there are strong democratic reasons far leaving this decision in the hands of the members of the company rather than with say, the elitist body of directors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The argument for taking certain decisions relating to people who are not part of the electorate away from a majority is precisely the argument that has led us to have a universal declaration of human rights and international conventions on human rights.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is something of a mouthful for the Committee to digest and I may have to delay our proceedings a little longer than normal.<br><br>
Our proposals are designed to reinforce the protection for minorities afforded by clause 47. If I may reinforce what I said in response to the Under-Secretary, there is always a difficulty when one is discussing democracy because there is a tension between the rights of a majority and the rights of minorities. If we hand over all decisions to a majority, that includes decisions to trample over the rights of minorities.<br><br>
For some years, virtually everyone who considered this matter was concerned that there should be some protection for minority shareholders against the abuse of powers by those controlling a company. There were the provisions of section 210 of the 1948 Act, but that section created at least two inhibitions which limited greatly the protection which it might otherwise have given. First, it related only to a course of conduct, and the courts were not happy to include under that description a single transaction, so that a single transaction, however unfair to the minority, would not readily fall within that section. Second, the section could be used only where the situation would have justified a winding up order but for the possibility of unfairness to the minority.<br><br>
Thus, unless those two situations applied, even if otherwise the court would have been minded to give relief, section 210 would not have been of great avail to minorities.<br><br>
The matter was considered by the Jenkins committee, and there are references in the Jenkins report to the need for more effective protection. It was included in the White Paper on changes in company law published by the previous Government, and it was enshrined in the 1978 Bill.<br><br>
Those proposals reappear virtually unchanged in clause 47. They are very welcome. One might be forgiven for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0160">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 289</span>
imagining that the text as it has now emerged might be largely uncontroversial. A petition now can be founded on a single unfair or oppressive act, not necessarily a course of conduct. Relief can be given even if the situation has not in the circumstances justified a winding-up order.<br><br>
We are all entitled to reflect on the views which we held in the past. Most of us are probably somewhat wiser for that intervening reflection. I am comforted by the thought that both the present Secretary of State and my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) have indicated that they have benefited by the reflection which they have given to these matters.<br><br>
The present Secretary of State indicated his thinking on the matter during the Second Reading debate on the 1978 Bill—exactly 12 months ago, 20 November 1978—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Another reason for a celebration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Another reason for a celebration, as my hon. Friend says. The right hon. Gentleman said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Naturally, I welcome the fact that greater protection will be given in the Bill to minority shareholders who have been—and I quote from the unfairly prejudiced '. But I am not sure that the drafting of the sections on minority shareholders is correct, or that the Bill goes far enough. We need to give a prescriptive opportunity to shareholders to vote in general meeting when the directors seek to dispose of substantial assets without reference to the owners of those assets—namely, the shareholders."—[<i>Official Report, 20 November 1978;</i> Vol. 958, c. 950–1.]</p></blockquote>
On Second Reading of this Bill, my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, Central mentioned that the present Secretary of State had expressed doubt as to whether the provisions went far enough and then said that, on reflection, he felt that he was probably right. So we are all entitled to benefit from our subsequent reflection.<br><br>
As I understand, both the Secretary of State and my hon. Friend—he can speak for himself if he wishes—are of the opinion that the present clause would impose on the petitioner the burden of proving conduct which is unfairly prejudicial. It provides a problem for a petitioner and those advising him for two reasons. First, it is not wholly
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 290</span>
predictable how widely or how narrowly the courts will construe that expression. It may be one of those things which enter into judicial folk lore and acquire a construction all their own, and many new situations fall outside them.<br><br>
Secondly, the petitioner may not have access to all the facts. I shall come back to that matter, because we have suggested an alternative method of dealing with it. But it is one of the constraints in the clause as it applies at the moment.<br><br>
One might ask: would it not be better, provided that the court is satisfied that the petitioner is acting bona fide, to give the court a complete discretion as to whether, in all the circumstances, it will allow the minority to bring an action on behalf of the company? So the Opposition are here proposing an approach which is slightly different, although I do not believe that there is such a yawning chasm between the two approaches as might appear from a first glance at the text.<br><br>
Our amendment owes its origin to the industry and imagination of my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, Central. He was kind enough to point out to me a recent article in the <i>Law Society Gazette,</i> of 17 October, and I am very grateful to the learned author of that article.<br><br>
The essence of the problem arises historically from the rule in Foss <i>v.</i> Harbottle. When I saw those names, I scented again in my nostrils the aroma of decaying leather and stale sandwiches which I shall for ever associate with lectures at the Council of Legal Education. I see that there are other members of the Committee with perhaps similar experiences. That was a decision in 1843. It accorded with the philosophy of that period, when a company was seen as a slightly more sophisticated version of a partnership. It decided that an individual shareholder might not maintain an action in the name of the company if the company itself in general meeting had not authorised the proceedings.<br><br>
That decision seems to have been reached on the ground that if the act which it was sought to complain about could be approved by the company, or ratified by general meeting, it would be pointless to give a remedy to minority shareholders which the general meeting could then proceed to nullify.<br><br>
The courts subsequently recognised
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0161">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 291</span>
that a ruling in that form clearly went too far, and four types of exception came to be recognised. First, there was an exception where the act complained of was ultra vires so that the general meeting could not have ratified it; second, where the act was one which could not be ratified by an ordinary resolution; third, where the act infringed the personal rights of a particular shareholder as opposed simply to the rights which he shared with the other shareholders; and fourth, where the act complained of amounted to a fraud on the minority.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
Those exemptions proved unsatisfactory, partly because it was somewhat unpredictable how they would be applied in certain circumstances. Clearly, what was needed was a more robust power in the courts to inquire into the whole way in which the majority was using its powers, and to protect minorities accordingly.<br><br>
Other countries have grappled with this problem with, perhaps, better effect. In the United States the courts adopted a different approach, which began in 1843, and therefore they were not subjected to the constraints of a case similar to Foss v. Harbottle. Broadly, as I understand it, the courts in most American jurisdictions permit the minority to enforce a corporate right provided that they have first made a demand on the board of directors and a further demand on the general body of shareholders to rectify the defect. Therefore, both the directors and the general body of shareholders are given an opportunity to deal with the situation—either to rectify or to ratify it.<br><br>
There are other requirements in the American jurisdiction, but I shall not labour those and delay the Committee.<br><br>
The problem was considered in 1967 by the Ontario committee on company law. That committee looked at the American solution. It was impressed by it but recognised that it was capable of abuse. For example, a shareholder, provided that he had made the demands, could use it to bring an action which was not well founded simply to bring pressure on the majority to reach some kind of accommodation to which they would not otherwise have been subjected.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 292</span>
The Ontario committee therefore recommended that an individual shareholder should have power to enforce corporate rights provided, first, that he has the leave of the court to bring the action, so that the court has a discretion on whether he can bring the action, and second, provided that he has established that he is acting bona fide and in the interests of the company as a whole.<br><br>
The Ontario committee proceeded to recommend that there should be further provision that the court could make suitable arrangements on costs which will be fair in all the circumstances, and that the action should not be discontinued, compromised or settled without leave of the court.<br><br>
Those were the recommendations of a highly qualified committee which had considered these matters at some length. Our amendments are basically founded on those recommendations.<br><br>
The Ontario committee envisaged that the conditions and further provisions should be embodied in the rules of court. We have suggested writing them into the Bill because, on the whole, we are believers in having all our law in one place. It is there for all to see, and people do not need to consult a multiplicity of documents. Furthermore, at least the amendment is on the Amendment Paper and the Committee can see what we have in mind.<br><br>
If the Government were to say "Yes, we accept what you say in principle but we think it would be better to embody these provisions in rules of court", my hon. Friend and I would not seek to divide the Committee on that issue.<br><br>
We have preserved the present subsection (2)—the power of the Secretary of State to apply to the court following an inspector's report. I note that there is to be a Government amendment to that subsection—amendment No. 238. I shall not seek to anticipate what the Minister will say on that.<br><br>
I think that the purpose of amendment No. 224 will be clear to the Committee. The present subsection (3) is very wide, and it may include what we have in mind in our amendment, but in the specific powers listed in subsection (4) there is no power to order financial reparation.<br><br>
That may be because it is thought to be obviously included in subsection (3), but if there is to be a list of those
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0162">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 293</span>
powers which appear to us in advance to be warranted, we wonder why that power is not listed. One would think that financial reparation for his loss is what the petitioner would be likely to seek.<br><br>
Although we agree that subsection (4) is specifically said to be without prejudice to the generality of subsection (3), we wish to know whether there are any reasons for omitting that particular power. At the risk of labouring the obvious, I wish to point out that this amendment is not dependent on amendment No. 221, and if amendment No. 221 did not appeal to the Committee, this would still be a sensible amendment.<br><br>
I turn now to new clause 17. It offers an alternative method of dealing with the need for power to order financial reparation. If amendment No. 224 were to appeal to the Committee, we would not need to press very hard for new clause 17. Those advising the Government may have noticed that it is based substantially on section 333 of the 1948 Act. If they have not noticed it, they will have time to go away and read section 333. It applies to winding-up proceedings. There appears to be no reason why it should apply only to insolvency, or why, if a director, a manager or an officer were guilty of certain shortcomings, the court should not have the power on an application under clause 47 to order him to make appropriate reparation.<br><br>
One problem in all these matters is that so often individual shareholders have no access to information under which they may exercise their rights. I have already suggested that that is one of the shortcomings of section 210. We were proposing to deal with that under new clause 16 by a simple proposal that that information should be made available to them. I am delighted, Sir Stephen, that you have now grouped new clause 17 with this group, because that is clearly where it belongs.<br><br>
There is a reference to the need of shareholders in the memorandum of the Law Society and the Senate. Comforted by such support, I do not need to delay the Committee in elaborating further. Amendment No. 230 is clearly consequential.<br><br>
That is the Opposition's thinking on this group of amendments. I hope that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 294</span>
the Minister will tell us the Government's thinking. I am an incurable optimist in these matters, and there may be no need for a long debate because the Government may tell us that they are persuaded. In any event, the Minister may tell us whether I have correctly interpreted the Government's thinking. I shall give him that opportunity, although it may be very unfair to do so with only five minutes left.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise because I am not at all confident about the intent or the wording of amendment No. 221, which seems in many respects ill founded. The proposed Subsection (1) states in part:
<br><blockquote><p>"… any member…may in a representational capacity for himself and all other members of the company …".</p></blockquote>
Presumably, that means that any member may start an action of this kind, involving other members of the company, whether or not they wish to be involved, in potential liability for the costs of the action and possible risk to their reputation, being involved in the action all the way through. I wonder whether that is the intention. I cannot see how that is in the interests generally of shareholders of a company.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have seen that the provisos indicate that
<br><blockquote><p>"No such petition shall be filed without leave of the court."</p></blockquote>
So the court has total control over the proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that, because there are points there which concern me. Purely on a drafting matter, the proposed subsection (1) states that this member may petition
<br><blockquote><p>"for or on behalf of the company"</p></blockquote>
Presumably, that means at the company's expense. I am not sure how that squares with the later provisions of subsection (1) in relation to costs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I go through these points first? The right hon. and learned Gentleman can deal with them later.<br><br>
Subsection (3) as proposed, states—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0163">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 295</span>
this answers the point that was put to me—
<br><blockquote><p>"Such petitioner must establish to the satisfaction of the court that he is acting in good faith and prima facie in the interests of the company in filing such petition."</p></blockquote>
It is almost impossible for any petitioner who has any scintilla of a claim not to be acting in good faith, so I regard that as being so wide as to be meaningless.<br><br>
As regards the provision that, prima facie, what he has to establish must be in the interests of the company, here again, strictly to establish that it is in the interests of the company he would need the directors, who, after all, manage the company, to decide that question. I am sure that that is not what the draftsmen intended. The only alternative is that the petitioner must say and believe that the action he is taking is in the interests of the company. That, again, seems to be a meaningless protection.<br><br>
The reason I am concerned about the weakness or the wideness of the proposed subsection (3) is that it might give rise to a multiplicity of claims and would in no sense be a protection to the company by the court against ridiculous and ill-founded claims.<br><br>
I come now to one other point on the proposed subsection (7).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must look at the entirety of the wording. We do not pretend that this is the last word in drafting. It is difficult for those who are not equipped with the help of the parliamentary draftsmen to get things absolutely right.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 296</span>
The court would be given power to deter vexatious claims—quite apart from its inherent jurisdiction anyway—under subsection (5) of our amendment. That should constitute a powerful deterrent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have to say that I disagree with the hon. Gentleman. It might deter frivolous claims, but I do not think that it would deter claims by people who are convinced, probably quite wrongly, that they have a case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the risk of being tiresome, may I say that I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for allowing me to intervene.
