	<div class='title'>SHADOW DIRECTORS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"(1) Subject to subsection (2) below, a person in accordance with those directions or instructions the directors of a company are accustomed to act ("a shadow director") shall be treated for the purposes of this Part of this Act as a director of the company unless the directors are accustomed so to act by reason only that they do so on advice given by him in a professional capacity.</p>
	<p>"(2) A shadow director shall not be guilty of an offence under section (Other provisions relating to recognised banks) (4) above by virtue only of subsection (1) above.</p>
	<p>"(3) Section 199 of the 1948 Act (disclosure by a director of a company of his interest in a contract, transaction or arrangement with the company) shall apply in relation to a shadow director of a company as it applies in relation to a director of a company, except that the shadow director shall declare his interest, not at a meeting of the directors, but by a notice in writing to the directors which is either—
	<ol>
	<li>a specific notice given before the date of the meeting at which, if he had been a director, the declaration would be required by subsection (2) of that section to be made; or</li>
	<li>a notice which under subsection (3) of that section (general notices) falls to be treated as a sufficient declaration of that interest or would fall to be so treated apart from the proviso;</li></ol>
and section 145 of that Act (minutes of proceedings of meetings) shall have effect as if the declaration had been made at the meeting in question and had accordingly formed part of the proceedings at that meeting.</p>

	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Reginald Eyre)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee will recall that, in introducing the first clauses on directors' conflicts of interests, we gave notice of our intention to bring forward a provision to extend them to cover persons on whose instructions the directors of a company are accustomed to act. The reference in new clause 49 to
	<br><blockquote><p>"this Part of this Act"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>636</span>
therefore means new clauses 21 to 37.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The circumstances in which shadow directors operate are such that they can procure the board to act otherwise than in the best interests of the company and yet might escape responsibility for such actions. The Companies Acts already recognise the possibility of shadow directors, and only now have we coined a term for a long descriptive phrase which has been with us since the 1948 Act. For example, the 1948 Act provides for the offences created in relation to fraud in the course of winding up to be equally applicable to shadow directors, and in the 1967 Act applies the provisions on directors' dealing in a company's own shares to what we now call shadow directors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since it is clear that a substantial shareholder, by pulling the strings from behind the scenes, would be able to evade the purpose of the new clauses which tighten up the extent to which directors can take undue advantage of the company's resources, we think it necessary to treat such a person as if he were a director. An example of such behaviour is to be found in the inspectors' report on Larkfold Holdings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will find the clause commendably short and self-explanatory. It seemed much better to have a separate clause rather to insert references to shadow directors into all the other clauses regulating loans and so on to directors. I shall therefore confine myself to a few points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) simply clarifies that the offence created in new clause 31 which the directors of a recognised bank commit if they fail to maintain the register or produce the annual statements of loans and so on shall not apply to shadow directors since they are not duly appointed directors on whom the statutory responsibility will lie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) applies the disclosure rules of section 199 of the 1948 Act, as amended by new clause 33, to shadow directors so that they are required to inform the board of their interest in a transaction and so forth which the company has entered or is about to enter into. The penalty in section 145 of the 1948 Act for failure to keep proper minutes—under which the company and every officer who is in default shall pay a default fine—is applied to this information. This therefore obliges the board to take notice of the shadow director's interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0350">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>637</span>
Finally, subsection (4) applies section 26 of the 1967 Act, which requires the disclosure of directors' contracts of service, to shadow directors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, shadow directors and their connected persons shall be just as much prohibited and made liable in the event of the contravention of such prohibitions, and shall have their loans and so on disclosed, as duly appointed directors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee may remember that, while loans and so forth between holding companies and subsidiaries are not prohibited by virtue of the director of one being connected with the other, loans made where such connection exists are to be disclosed in the annual accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should now explain that since tabling clause 49 we have noticed that it would, when construed with the disclosure clause—new clause 28—have the defect of requiring the disclosure of all loans and so forth between a subsidiary and its holding company because, in a group situation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not, I am afraid, listening to this last part and all I heard was the reference to a subsidiary company. I have to try to catch up with the hon. Gentleman, who has now adopted the custom of reading very quickly. My complaint against him in the beginning was that he was reading too slowly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to please the hon. Gentleman, and I shall slow up. I was drawing attention to a point which, quite frankly, has occurred to us since tabling new clause 49. I was disclosing to the Committee that, since tabling the new clause, we have noticed that it would, when construed with the disclosure clause, new clause 28, have the defect of requiring the disclosure of all loans and so on between a subsidiary and its holding company because, in a group situation, a holding company would be none other than a shadow director.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not our intention, of course, to produce what would in those circumstances be an obstructive result. There is no need to make arrangements here for the disclosure of normal intra-group financing arrangements. There are already specific provisions elsewhere in the Companies Acts which require the disclosure of the financial arrangements between a holding company and subsidiaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>638</span>
Our object in this clause is, rather, to place the prohibitions and disclosure rules applicable to directors on those persons who surreptitiously influence the operations of a company without being one of the duly appointed directors. We shall therefore bring forward an amendment on Report to prevent the disclosure of normal intra-group dealings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government put this new clause down yesterday, I believe, and we have not had the necessary opportunity to scrutinise it. I confess that this is the first opportunity I have had of looking at it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has helped to explain the Government's objectives. We share his view that this is a potential abuse, and perhaps a practised one, which needs to be dealt with. Our anxiety is that the clause may in a material respect be somewhat vague. Subsection (1) provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to subsection (2) below, a person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of a company are accustomed to act"</p></blockquote>
shall be treated as "a shadow director".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not at all sure that that will catch the sort of abuse that the Minister has been speaking of. It is perfectly possible, I should have thought, that a shadow director can exercise an influence through others that would avoid the sort of detection that we have in mind as necessary, and thereby avoid the provision operating. One could have a single act of intervention on the part of somebody who effectively could manipulate the company but he does not in fact exercise that power save where some very material issue arises. Would he then be said to be "accustomed" to act as a shadow director? Yet that single act could be of enormous significance for the future of the company, its work force and the rest. Therefore, I wonder whether the words "accustomed to act" are the most appropriate here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put that forward as a thought on the spur of the moment. Clearly, we have not had an opportunity to consider the matter or to consult about it. It would be helpful to know in that respect whether the Government themselves have consulted about the clause, its purpose and its wording. The desire to tame surreptitious influences in companies' activities is one on which we entirely agree with the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, I hope that the Government
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0351">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>639</span>
are not proposing to introduce something on Report about shadow ministers, because we should then take a very serious view. We do not adopt or exert a surreptitious influence; we are absolutely overt in everything we do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister can answer those few points, but we give notice that we shall come back to this matter on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Stevens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There must be many Back-Bench Members of Parliament who have sat over the years in Standing Committees with the growing sense of frustration and a feeling that they may be only painted on the backdrop. However, during the consideration of this Bill, I have on a few occasions drawn to the attention of my hon. Friend the Minister for Trade the need to cover the point incorporated in this new clause, and, notwithstanding that he would no doubt have introduced the clause even had I been elsewhere, I shall go to my grave satisfied and telling all my friends that this new clause is here because of my intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Put it in your election address.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always grateful for advice from the hon. Gentleman on the composition of my election address. I thank my hon. Friend the Minister, even if he does not need it from me, and I am very pleased to support the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Stevens) is obviously a shadow director of the Minister, and evidently the Minister is accustomed to act on his advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little puzzled by these words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… a person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of a company are accustomed to act".</p></blockquote>
The only exception, as I read the clause, is a professional person. Many companies, of course, are accustomed to act on the advice of the shop steward or other trade union official. In fact, they frequently take his advice more than that of anybody else. Does he, the shop steward, become a shadow director?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one more facetious question. If a number of hon and right hon. Members were directors of a company, would the Whip be a shadow director?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>640</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) for the welcome he gave to the general purpose of this clause. I have noted carefully the two points he made on its detailed application. As I have said—I thought it right that I should tell the Committee at once—we shall have to introduce the minor amendment to the clause to which I referred. We shall consider carefully what the hon. Gentleman said to see whether the clause can be improved in any way to meet the points he has raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Stevens) is glad of the attention that my hon Friend the Minister for Trade has given to his suggestion, and we are glad that we have been able to do something practical to meet the point that he raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate, too, the points raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page). He described them as facetious, but in fact they raise a question of principle as to how a shadow director can come into being. We shall consider all these anxieties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ought to end by saying that I am grateful to the hon. Member for Hackney, Central for his splendid suggestion—which followed his reference to surreptitious activities—when he said that we might also consider the activities of Shadow Ministers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was perhaps a muted note of complaint in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) in the last debate. Perhaps the debate was too precipitate, because we had not had proper opportunity to read the clause. My complaint, if I ever had one, is the reverse. I have been within moments of making this speech at at least two previous sittings. At the last sitting, the Minister for Trade observed that only you, Sir Stephen, had been listening to his speech. If I was not listening with my usual rapt attention, it was because I was scrambling to get my references together in time to rise to my feet. But all things come to those who wait.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 11 will not occasion the Government or the Committee any astonishment. The principle was referred to on Second Reading by my hon, Friend the Member for Hackney, Central. Moreover, this is one of the debates when some members of the Committee will experience a feeling of 	<i>déjà vu.</i> It was debated in a long and interesting sitting of the Standing Committee on the 1978 Bill, and I feel that it is almost an impertinence for a newly-arrived upstart like me to venture to repeat all the arguments which were then so fully rehearsed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic issue was how far the law on the duties and responsibilities of directors should be left where it lies among the varied judicial decisions or whether it should be embodied in a code. Those who argue that practitioners and those who have to operate this branch of the law should be left to cull the principles from the various crevices where they lie were, no doubt, left hoping that their textbooks would be up to date, and employing such latter-day aids to construction as the index to the Law Reports and Current Law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair to say that those who took that view did agree that there should be some statutory provisions to supplement the case law. I shall, if I may, state tendentiously what they were proposing. They were proposing that Parliament should add yet another crevice where practitioners and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0353">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>643</span>
company secretaries would have to seek for their law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument for that course of action, as I understand it, is that codification cannot provide for every eventuality, so any code is necessarily incomplete. I am bound to say that I have some difficulty in understanding why that should be said to be a disadvantage as against leaving the law in the existing case law, since that must be even more partial and incomplete than a code would be. I would not seek to argue with St Paul, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away".</p></blockquote>
I would only submit to the Committee that the more complete should be preferred to the less complete. There it is, Sir Stephen—there are those two views, and each may claim a respectable measure of support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against codification stands the Jenkins committee; for codification there is the Bullock committee. Against codification, at least during the previous debates, was the Law Society. For codification we may cite the Consultative Committee of Accountancy bodies, the CBI, the Bar Association for Commerce, Finance and Industry, and the Association of British Chambers of Commerce. Since those debates took place, no doubt other distinguished bodies will have had an opportunity to range themselves on one side or the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument for codification or for leaving it all where the judges have left it extends well beyond the scope of company law. I favour taking steps to bring the law together in one place, even though I accept that situations arise for which the code has not provided and therefore the code would need to be looked at from time to time in order to bring it up to date. I am not attracted by the argument that because we cannot provide for every situation we should not attempt to offer some comprehensive guidelines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister for Trade, in that former incarnation before his talents were adequately recognised, quoted from Jenkins in support of the view that there should not be codification that any statutory statement of the duty of directors
	<br><blockquote><p>"should be in addition to and not in derogation of any other enactment or rule of law relating to the duties or liabilities of directors of a company.—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 22 February 1979; c. 767.].</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>644</span>
That, clearly, is a possible point of view. But in this Bill the hon. Gentleman does not seem to have followed the logic of that passage. He is not suggesting that the present judicial decisions and other rules of law should be supplemented by statute. I have looked in vain for anything in this Bill which deals with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) of our new clause relates to the duty to act "honestly" and to
	<br><blockquote><p>"observe the utmost good faith.</p></blockquote>
One criticism levelled at that in earlier debates was that the expression "utmost good faith" is taken from insurance law and entails an obligation to disclose completely any information which might be relevant in the course of negotiations for a deal. It was said that that would not be appropriate for company law because it might entail disclosing company secrets which might be helpful to competitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The duty to disclose is owed to the company. If there is some transaction between a director and the company, it is not easy to see why there should not be the fullest possible disclosure, either to fellow directors or to the appropriate officer of the company, and in most cases, with some possible exceptions, to the whole body of shareholders. We shall no doubt hear what the Government have to say on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) begins:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A director of a company shall not—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>a</i>) allow a conflict to arise between the duties of his office and his private interests or any duties he owes to any other person.</p></blockquote>
I noted from the previous debates that the Law Society had pointed out that at present there was no case where it had been decided that a director acts illegally merely because he permits a conflict to arise. In the Law Society's view:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The true rule is that a director who enters into engagements in which he has a personal interest or a duty to others conflicting or which may conflict with interests of the company will be liable to account for any resulting benefit and, if the engagement is with the company, it may be voidable".—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 22 February 1979; c. 744.].</p></blockquote>
I should respectfully accept that as a statement of the existing law. There was a certain doubt in my mind about this text, which was taken from the earlier Bill. One might sometimes permit a conflict of interest to arise without any guilty intention or action. I cannot speak for my hon. Friend for Hackney, Central, but I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0354">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>645</span>
could easily be persuaded by the Government that perhaps some other form of wording is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, subsection (6) gives a right to the company to be recouped—which is precisely what the Law Society's observation was about—where there have been abuses of a company's money or the company's information. We believe that that is at least as important in many cases as criminal proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that new clause 12 is much less likely to be controversial. It has certainly been less controversial in the past. On the previous Standing Committee there seemed to be general agreement, as I understood it, that directors should have a clear statement of their duty of care and that the company was entitled to know what it was entitled to expect from directors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At one of the recent sittings of this Committee, there was some discussion of the duties of tea-ladies. I can understand that there might be a question as to how far a tea-lady possessed professional qualifications, but I should have thought that for all practical purposes a director was a professional person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Almost all professional people in this country have a clearly stated duty of care. The argument in this case was whether the duty should vary according to the individual skill of the director, and in subsection (2) we have retained the suggestion that it should.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that if a company has need on the board of an expert in Middle Eastern affairs and it appoints someone to the board because of his expertise in that field, it ought to expect such skill reasonably to flow from someone who is an expert in Middle Eastern affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The contrary argument is that there ought to be the same level of skills from all directors, and it ought not to vary according to the specific expertise of a director. But one of the problems that we face is that there are no specific qualifications prescribed by statute or anywhere else for company directors. Perhaps that is sensible. Perhaps it is because the skills and expertise which are required of a company director may vary very much according to the company concerned and the duties which he is expected to perform within it. But I should have thought that a company was entitled to expect, when a director was chosen by reason of possessing a particular expertise, that he would
	<span class='label label-info column'>646</span>
have the skill appropriate to that expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is based on the duties as set out in the judgment in the County Equitable Fire Insurance Company case, and, for the moment, we on this side are persuaded that that is the right way in which to leave it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What puzzles us is that, whether it be right or not that the skill to be expected depends upon the personal and particular expertise of a director or whether there should be something more general, it was agreed in the last debates that there ought to be a clear standard of what a company is entitled to expect and what the director is obliged to give. But, as I read it, there is nothing in the Bill at all about that, subjective or objective. Perhaps we shall be told by the Government that they are reserving it for the next Bill. If so, that is one more of the goodies to which the Committee is being invited to look forward, when, in due course, the next Bill is introduced. It will be some Bill, and it will be a great parliamentary event, no doubt. But as yet we see no good reason why this provision should not be included in the present Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Trade (Mr. Cecil Parkinson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and learned Member for Warley, West (Mr. Archer) was kind enough to refer to the debates which we had on these two clauses, which were clauses 44 and 45 of the 1978 Bill and are now re-produced on the Notice Paper. I made clear on Second Reading that we had considered this matter very carefully and had come to the conclusion that these two clauses, which attempted to codify the duties of directors and the standards expected of them, were likely to cause more confusion than clarity and, in the circumstances, we dicided not to proceed with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made the Government's attitude quite clear on Second Reading and explained that, in taking that attitude, we were following the arguments set out, I hope fairly clearly, in the last Committee. I accept the right hon. and learned Gentleman's objectives, and in the last Committee I gave an example from the building industry, which perhaps I could repeat now since I think I was the only person here who was on that Committee—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>647</span>
fusely, Sir Stephen, and I apologise also for repeating my story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the building industry, traditionally, when the new apprentice arrives on a site and there is a difficult problem of moving or manoeuvring a heavy piece of equipment, the new apprentice is sent off for a sky hook. He goes along to the stores and asks for it. Everybody knows there is no such thing. It is a device that the building industry has been waiting for for a very long time. One can throw it up in the sky, where it will automatically hang itself, and from it one can move heavy pieces of machinery in any direction. The man who invents it will make a fortune. Of course, it is impossible of invention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is exactly the same in codifying the duties of directors. There is nothing the Government would like more than two 10-word clauses which summed the whole thing up—first summed up the duties of directors, and then in another 10 words defined the standards with which they should apply them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that these two new clauses are an attempt by the Opposition to create a statutory company law sky hook. We do not think that it is possible to do what they are seeking to do, and we think that the result of new clauses 11 and 12 will be increased confusion, not increased clarity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was the case we argued at great length in Committee last time. The right hon. and learned Gentleman said that he had read the last Committee proceedings and had followed our argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the debate, it simply boiled down to a choice. Shall we, by attempting to codify, albeit imperfectly, the current state of company law make the duties of directors clearer? We came to the conclusion in Committee at that time, and again as the Government, that the answer was "No, we should not be helping." We should be giving the appearance of dealing with something while probably causing more problems than we were solving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was our basic argument. I gave the back-up arguments at great length in Committee last time. I gave the reasons on Second Reading of this Bill. It would serve no purpose to rehearse at length the arguments. They boil down simply to "Do we codify, or do we allow case law to
	<span class='label label-info column'>648</span>
carry on developing?" Would codification inhibit the development of case law in this difficult area? We are convinced that it probably would, and that is why we did not include these clauses and why we shall resist them if the right hon. and learned Gentleman presses them to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I did not have the opportunity of saying anything about this in the last Committee, I have had the opportunity of listening to my hon. Friends story, which put us all in our place—it was a pleasure to hear it again—about the mythical sky hook which we shall never find.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have to confess that I am in retreat from the idea of codification. It seems to me that one either tries to codify the law as it is, or one produces a different set of rules. The fault in these two clauses is that they come somewhere neatly in the middle of these two different objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly worried by subsection (3), which produces the concept of a conflict, because it seems to me essential that in the life of any business man there will be a conflict between his own private interests and those of the company of which he is a director. I do not think that one need be too worried about that. The Law Society gave a number of examples of the kind of results that might emerge in practice, and I think that it would be a dangerous concept to embark upon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have sympathy with the suggestion that directors should observe "utmost good faith" towards the company. But subsection (1) does not seem to limit this to the dealings directors have with a company, which I should have thought would be an important limitation on that considerable extention of directors' responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) introduces a new concept, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The directors of a company shall not perform any of their functions for a purpose not contemplated by the instrument or resolution conferring or imposing that function".</p></blockquote>
It seems to me that that is either a meaningless or ineffective concept or, indeed, it is limiting directors' powers very considerably. I suspect that this subsection as drafted would constitute such a limitation as would in practice make it difficult for directors to exercise their power in the normal way a business man does, that is,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0356">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>649</span>
to meet any contingency which arises and to take business decisions from day to day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a similar view about the concept of "relevant information", which is either an attempt to say what directors already do or—which I think it would be on the wording—a considerable widening of directors' liabilities. I wonder whether the right hon. and learned Gentleman considers, in the light of the insider dealing clauses we have already accepted, that the concept of trying to restrict directors in the way contemplated by subsection (4) is now irrelevant, or certainly unnecessary. For these reasons, I am very much opposed to these two clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was a little puzzled by what I thought was the original argument of the hon. Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Baker), that codification is one thing, amendment is something different, but one should not try to combine them. I cannot see why it should be more difficult or more undesirable to codify the law with suitable amendments than to codify the law unamended. The Chairman and other hon. and right hon. Members in the Committee will know that the Joint Committee on Consolidation attempts to do just that. There are occasions when it is right to codify a particular branch of the law with suitable amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Beyond that, I would only comment on the hon. Gentleman's speech that if he thinks that there are amendments to our text which ought to be made, we would not listen to them with closed minds. It has never been our argument that our text is beyond improvement. If we can have a debate about that, we should be delighted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason the Government will not accept our clauses, as I understand from the Minister for Trade, is that they believe that what we are attempting is impossible of achievement, that clarification is beyond our reach, that clarification is a jurisprudential sky hook, and the labours of the jurisprudents down the ages—all the textbook writers, all the people who have written treatises on the law—are really reaching out for the unattainable and they might as well have saved their breath to cool their porridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We just do not accept that. We think that the law is not beyond clarification. We think that it is possible to reduce a complicated body of law to a less complicated text. It is possible to provide one
	<span class='label label-info column'>650</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. and learned Gentleman accept that the nature of directors' duties must vary according to the nature of companies, and second, that courts do not perform a bad job of developing the law in relation to directors' duties and can be expected, presumably, to go on developing this law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course. That has been true of every branch of the law. It was true of the law of landlord and tenant, but it did not deter Parliament from attempting to codify it. Exactly the same arguments could have been advanced against that. It could have been said that one could not have a general law of landlord and tenant because various premises are differently constructed and different activities go on in them. But Parliament faced up to that. It produced a code of landlord and tenant law related to the duties of landlords and of tenants, in relation to premises of various kinds, and it seems to me to have worked very well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might have been argued that one could not codify the duties of an employer to his employees because every kind of business activity is different and there are different kinds of premises and different kinds of machinery. But we have a very adequate code. I say "adequate". I must be careful that that is not quoted against me on some other occasion. I think that it can be improved. But we have a code embodying the duties of employers to their employees. I fail to see why it should be impossible equally to embody the duties of directors to their companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) has reminded me that the Conservatives did not always take so dogmatic a view as they take today. In 1973 the Conservative Government of that day introduced a Companies Bill, and it is my hon. Friend's recollection that in one of his previous incarnations the Minister for Trade supported his Government in an attempt to do precisely what we are doing now. Anyone is entitled to change his mind. It would not surprise me if the present Government altered their minds more than once in the course of the next few months. But at least we are entitled to ask why they changed their minds so dramatically here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0357">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>651</span>
I am not clear that the Minister's reasoning is intended to apply equally to new clause 12. I must accept that the Government are being consistent as between what they said in the previous Committee about new clause 11 and what they are saying now, but, if I may say so, they are being inconsistent between what they are saying now and what they said about the content of new clause 12.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There it is. We have put our arguments. I agree that the Committee would not benefit from rehearsing them fully again. They are all there to be read. We abide by our view and in the circumstances propose to divide the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and learned Gentleman asked what had happened between 1973 and now. We believe that in our 1973 Bill we tried to implement Jenkins—that is, we did not set out to codify but we set out a statement of principles, which was different from the attempt in clause 44 actually to codify. We set out a set of principles which we said were to be interpreted. We said that they were really an attempt to state the existing law but that the existing law remained and that was an attempt to summarise. We were not attempting to replace existing law by a statement which codified it. We were attempting to state the existing principles, which could be interpreted according to case law. Having thought about the matter very carefully, we came to the conclusion that the attempt to codify could cause more problems than it would solve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I give one example. Subsection (8) takes us straight back into case law. Although the clause tries to codify and summarise the law, subsection (8) then says that the penalties and so on will depend upon existing case law. So one is pushed straight back into existing case law to interpret subsection (8). We feel that that is just evidence that what the right hon. and learned Gentleman is trying to achieve is not easy to attain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>652</span>
	<p>I do not wish to repeat my arguments, but, in summarising our objections to clause 44 in the old Bill, we said that it did not meet the Jenkins test and that the clause could be accepted only if it met two tests, first, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it accurately and comprehensively states the law as it is in a manner fit to cover any situation or, second, that the present law is so perfect that it is incapable of any improvement or development save by statute to cover future situations".—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 6 March 1979; c. 803.].</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>Those were the two tests which the Law Society said should be applied to clause 44, and it came to the conclusion that the clause failed on both counts. We say that new clause 11 also it fails to meet the tests that Jenkins and the Law Society quite properly set for it, and therefore, while it is a worthwhile concept, the clause is so faulty that it would cause confusion and would not add to the body of law.</p>
	<p>I admit to the right hon. and learned Gentleman that I find new clause 12 more difficult, and I apologise to him for skating over it a little. He is right—we debated this issue in the last Committee, and there was a considerable body of sympathy for the view that one ought to attempt to define standards of skill and care that a director owed to a company. But, again, we have come to the conclusion—my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Baker) referred to this—for the basic reason that we believe that it would inhibit the development of case law, which is developing the whole time, that new clause 12 is better left out of the Bill.</p>

I have no hesitation in saying that this short clause is one of the most interesting new clauses that we have had to date. At least, I shall try to make it interesting. It has some human or humane background to it. I am always astonished when I read of the extraordinary things which people leave in railway carriages, forgotten and unclaimed. I am even more astonished when I learn that the unclaimed prize money in Ernie's coffers exceeds £½ million. Some prizes of even £1,000 remain unclaimed. I am informed that Marks and Spencer has £100,000 of unclaimed dividends—just to use an example of one of the major companies—and it is estimated that in the top 30 companies approximately £3 million of unclaimed dividends lie in their hands.

As a dutiful nephew, wondering what his aunt has left—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Anyway, it all happened more than a day or two ago. Amongst his aunt's belongings the hon. Gentleman finds a nice little case of love letters written by his uncle to his aunt when they were courting. They are tied up with pink tape, beautifully scented, and he glances through them—the uncle having died some years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0359">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>655</span>
One of the love letters is written on the back of a sheet torn from his uncle's notebook, and on the back there is a list of investments, one of which is some shares in the North Sea Bubble Company. The hon. Gentleman knows that the uncle's estate was wound up some time ago but, out of interest, he asks the solicitor who acted for his uncle about this holding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The solicitor says that a more up-to-date list was used and they did not think that the uncle possessed those shares at the time of his death. But the hon. Member for Hackney, Central knows that when an estate is wound up, even if the North Sea Bubble Company was in liquidation the liquidator has to file a list of amounts payable and paid to creditors or to contributories and a list of unclaimed amounts, both creditors and contributories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that, after the company went into liquidation, one of the concessions of the North Sea Bubble Company produced a lot of oil and not only all the creditors were paid 100 per cent. but there was some to spare for the contributories. So our hero, if I may so proclaim him, goes to the companies registry to look at the list of unclaimed dividends—again I say that it is not merely income from shares but the capital, the shares themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With great glee, the hon. Gentleman finds his uncle's name in the list of unclaimed dividends in the liquidation which the liquidator is obliged to file in the companies registry. There is his uncle's name with quite a substantial amount against it, apparently, according to the list, never claimed. So he knows exactly what to do. He goes to the Department of Trade and asks to make a claim for payment of that sum out of the companies liquidation account at the Bank of England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is ushered in to see the appropriate official at the Department. The official looks at the file and says "Sorry, chum, this has been paid. The Secretary of State made an order for payment some years ago." So the hon. Gentleman says "Why on earth was it not crossed off the list? Why did it still remain on the list of unclaimed dividends in the liquidation?"—a list, incidentally, which is open for anybody to see, and thereby extremely misleading, if those who have been paid are not crossed off that list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no obligation on the Depart-
	<span class='label label-info column'>656</span>
ment, when the Secretary of State makes such an order, to file that order with the companies registry and have the list of unclaimed dividends amended, or at least marked that the Secretary of State has ordered that the money be paid out. This means that those lists, although they are open to the public, are entirely misleading. They do not inform the public of what is still outstanding, of what moneys are still in the Government's hands at the Bank of England earning money for the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One suspects that perhaps the Government and the Bank of England are not too keen on letting people know what is there in case some of it may be claimed. I submit that no obstruction should be put in the way of anyone intending to claim. It is quite true that if one is concerned with a claimant, in the same way that I suggested the hon. Member for Hackney, Central was concerned through his aunt dying and his uncle's estate which apparently had an unclaimed dividend in that company, one can go to the Department and say "I am involved in this way; will you please tell me whether this unclaimed dividend has or has not been claimed?" I am sure the Department gives the information when that inquiry is made. There are firms which provide a useful service to the public in tracing missing persons. They will look at these lists of unclaimed dividends and make the sort of inquiries which they are expert in making. Indeed, on many occasions they will discover missing persons on their list and give notice of the amount which may be claimed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has probably not observed that the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) has just dashed out to look at the list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure he is commercially minded and has gone to look at the list. As I have said, the Department could tell him, if he is inquiring about a specific case, whether the amount has been paid. These firms provide, commercially and for profit, a good service to the public by searching for missing persons. They do it on speculation, because if they take a list of these unclaimed dividends and make inquiries for missing persons, they may fail. They may spend quite a lot of money in searching. Of course, they would spend a lot more if they were searching for them and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0360">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>657</span>
they had already been paid, because the Department is not obliged to note up the orders which the Secretary of State has made against the list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now I come to how my new clause fits into this story. By the amendment to section 343 of the 1948 Act, it would oblige the Department to file an order for payment of an unclaimed dividend so that the unclaimed dividend list at the companies registry would be brought up to date. One would not need to go searching for an apparently missing person who has not been paid when indeed he has been paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I specifically admitted that the firms which give this service to the public by tracing missing people do it for profit. They would therefore be quite prepared to pay a fee for searching the list to see what claims had or had not been claimed. If I am told that it would cost the Department and the companies registry £X a year if the few claims per year that are the subject of the Secretary of State's order for payment were noted on the file, let us divide that estimate and calculate a reasonable economic fee. I am not talking about a few pence because, if these firms are successful in tracing missing persons and receive their commission out of payment, they are quite prepared to pay something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to my hon. Friend that the companies registry and the Department can make a little profit out of this with no harm. I do not see anything immoral or against public policy in a firm tracing missing people and saying that there is some money to be claimed for them. After all, it is there to be claimed and no obstruction should be put in the way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the new clause is accepted, there is no need for me to put in the fee payable by those who wish to examine the full list. That would come into regulations. It would naturally follow that the Secretary of State had the power to make such regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a simple proposal which would be of great benefit to those who are forgetful or perhaps, in the case of successors of deceased persons, never knew that the money was held there for them, being held by the Government, through the Bank of England, waiting for their claim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) has
	<span class='label label-info column'>658</span>
contributed greatly to the work of this Committee. I am grateful to him for his industry in preparing this new clause and drawing our attention to what he has described as a human and humane aspect of company law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was moved also by my right hon. Friend's description of the love-letters written on the back of lists of investments, even though, unfortunately, in the case that he described it turned out to be a dud clue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the new clause would be to ensure that the lists of persons entitled to unclaimed dividends and unclaimed returns of capital, which the liquidator in a voluntary liquidation is required to file with the registrar of companies, would be kept up to date, in the event of the Department of Trade later paying out some or all of such moneys to the person or persons entitled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is highly desirable that, where documents are placed on a company file which is open to inspection by the public, these documents should be kept up to date, and I think that the extra work involved in this instance, as suggested by my right hon. Friend in his very reasonable presentation, is justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have doubts, however, whether the introduction of this procedure is best achieved by amending section 343(3) of the Companies Act 1948, as my right hon. Friend proposes. The requirement upon the liquidator to file these lists is laid down not in the Act but in rule 197 of the Companies (winding-up) Rules 1949. I think it preferable—I hope that this will please and satisfy my right hon. Friend—that I give an undertaking that my Department will implement straight away the procedure for keeping these lists up to date by administrative action. I shall then refer the matter to the Insolvency Rules Advisory Committee so that it can advise on what amendment to the rules should be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ought to make clear that the updating of the lists on the company file, whether the procedure is brought in by the proposed amendment or in the way I suggest, which I believe would be the best way of dealing with it, would apply only to voluntary liquidations. In the case of compulsory liquidations, nothing relating to the winding up of a company is filed with the registrar of companies other than the notice of the making of the winding-up order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0361">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>659</span>
I strongly emphasise to the Committee that to achieve a similar situation in compulsory windings-up as we are now seeking to bring about in voluntary liquidations would be contrary to the long-established policy that in compulsory liquidations only the court can, in the circumstances of each case, decide who should receive information concerning the winding-up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that my right hon. Friend will appreciate that important distinction between voluntary and compulsory liquidations, and I hope that he will be glad that I have been able to indicate a way in which we can achieve the improvement that he seeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to my hon. Friend. I entirely appreciate that the only way to do this is by means of the rules, but one does not have the opportunity in this place of amending rules or proposing amendments to rules, whereas one does to statutes.

I propose to deal with compulsory liquidations when the opportunity arises perhaps on another occasion. This will leave time to take a beautiful bunch of flowers or wreath to the grave of the aunt of the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) in celebration of this victory.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must declare an interest here because I have some claim to the authorship of the idea which was announced by my right hon. Friend the former Secretary of State for Trade in the Second Reading debate on the Companies Bill in November 1978. Despite that claim to authorship, I still think it is a good idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic concept that he was advancing at that stage, which the Labour Government supported, was that one should have a small but representative committee, expert in company law, encompassing people who had interests in the reform of company law, which was capable of considering the law on a continuing basis—examining changes in judge-made law, considering recommendations made by inspectors in their reports, and themselves putting forward recommendations for reform as they thought fit. They would advise the Secretary of State accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The advantage of making public such recommendations so that people who were interested in this topic outside the Department of Trade would be able to examine the recommendations, discuss them and consult about them, and indeed offer their own comments to the panel and to the Secretary of State, was in our view very significant. It was, in a sense, a way of opening up in a way which has not been possible previously the whole field of discussion about company law reform. It would have been a valuable exercise in open government. Notwithstanding that it is a technical field, it is still vital, as I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0362">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>661</span>
think all members of the Committee will agree, to the well-being of British industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a sad reflection that successive Governments have found it so difficult to embark on substantive changes in company law. Even this Government with their sizeable majority appeared initially to be very reticent about doing it, as we know very well. That they have decided to make this Bill a significant step in company law reform is welcomed on this side of the Committee. It took them a long time to make up their mind about it, and that is why this Committee is faced with a very unsatisfactory procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we enter the era of the technological revolution, company law must perforce keep up with the changes that society demands instead of languishing as it has done in the past. Therefore, I contend that reporting to the public, consultation with the public, with outside bodies, not leaving the initiative solely to the Department of Trade, expert though the officials in the Department of Trade may be, is an important facet of our new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unhappily, it is just that facet that is eschewed by the Government in their proposals announced on Second Reading. It will be remembered that they are proposing to ask Professor Gower, a distinguished lawyer, to head a panel of advisers, but they will be dealing solely with the Department. There is to be no question of their reporting outside. That contrasts with our own proposals in a very material particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will also be recalled that our suggestion was widely welcomed. I do not think that the Under-Secretary of State would begin to dispute that. Indeed, I cannot recall any criticism of the idea from the then Opposition. They did not suggest that it was a bad idea that the panel should report publicly on its deliberations. They uttered not one word of criticism at the time. It was never suggested that the panel would be an unwelcome and undesirable quango, which, of course, is a sort of knee-jerk reaction for the Conservative Party now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now, what the Government are suggesting can only be described, I think, as a quasi-quango, because quasi-loans and quasi-quangos can be part of the whole apparatus of this Bill. I think that it should be defined in the interpretation clause. Although it does not appear, it ought to appear as a semi-secret organisa-
	<span class='label label-info column'>662</span>
tion proferring its expertise to the Secretary of State in private, which he also in private may accept or reject as he in his sole discretion thinks fit. That is what it comes to. It is a thoroughly undesirable way of tackling this important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I applaud the choice of Professor Gower as the principal outside adviser, why should he be called upon to do his job 	<i>in camera?</i>So distinguished is he that I believe that his thoughts should be shared. What are his views on the matter? Does he believe that he should be inhibited in this way? Has he, indeed, been consulted, or have the Government just said to Professor Gower "Come along, strengthen the counsels that we can call upon within our Department because we feel that they may be deficient in some material way"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the views of other members of the Government's proposed panel? Have they been consulted? What general consultations with the professional bodies have the Government embarked upon? Do they think that the Government's idea is better than ours? All the information I have is to the contrary. My understanding is that the professional bodies warmly acclaimed our proposals, and in particular the suggestion that the panel should publish its deliberations. I have no evidence in my possession—it may be that the Under-Secretary of State can refute this—that the professions feel that his idea is a significant advance, or any advance at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the detail of our proposals. Subsection (1) provides the principle of investing the committee with a responsibility for making recommendations. Subsection (2) requires the Secretary of State to consult the committee before coming forward with any proposal for change in company law. That represents a valuable form of consultation—a commitment to consult—but it does not inhibit the Secretary of State from embarking on changes once he has engaged in consultation, even if the panel does not agree with his proposals. No veto is proposed for the panel. That is absolutely right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) provides for a small but manageable committee, but we do not suggest that there is any particular magic in the numbers. The Government may feel that it ought to be widened, if they accept the principle, or somewhat narrowed, but
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0363">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>663</span>
that is not a matter on which we have any very firm views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsections (4) and (5) provide for a committee with a broad base. We believe that it is right that employers' and employees' organisations should be able to provide two members of the panel. Subsection (7) provides for publication annually of the deliberations of the panel, and invests Parliament with a role in being able to scrutinise the panel's activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One thing that puzzled me while the hon. Member was dealing with subsection (4) was this. Why should not the Secretary of State consult an organisation that represents shareholders?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be possible under subsection (5)(	<i>e</i>) for the Secretary of State to do that. There is nothing to inhibit him from consulting a body of shareholders. Which body it would be I do not know. Perhaps the hon. Member can put forward some suggestions. There is nothing to inhibit the Secretary of State from carrying out wider consultations than those which are specifically laid down. That is a matter of detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am most anxious to do is to find out in principle what the Government think about our proposals for open government in this field. I hope that Government supporters will feel that there is intrinsic merit in what we propose. I do not believe, and I hope nobody will suggest, that this is a party-political matter. It is not. I think that the burden falls on the Government to establish why their route—the secret one—is to be preferred, particularly since they welcomed our proposals previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government reject our ideas, they should clarify what the position of members of their panel will be. Are the discussions which are to take place between members of their panel and the Secretary of State to be regarded as confidential? Are the members of the panel to be free to discuss the nature of their discussions with the Secretary of State with other members of their profession? In other words, are they to be constrained in the way that civil servants may be? Will Ministers impose an embargo upon what members of the panel may discuss while discussions are going on with the Minister or with officials? I think that that would be an unreasonable veto upon the ability of the members of the panel to discuss these matters widely with
	<span class='label label-info column'>664</span>
their own professional colleagues, and with colleagues in other professions, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From discussions I have had on this matter with professional bodies—I stress that these discussions have been informal and do not necessarily represent the views of the professional bodies as a whole—I have the impression that considerable disquiet would be expressed if the Government were to say that the sort of constraints I have been describing were to affect the activities of members of the panel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government would be wise to accept the principle of the clause. It may be imperfectly drafted but that is a matter for further discussion. We are concerned about the issue of principle here. We believe that the Government were wrong in making the announcement in the way they did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause seeks to require the Secretary of State to set up a standing advisory committee on company law. Under the terms of the clause, this would be a permanent body with statutory functions and its reports would be required to be laid before Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until I read the new clause, I had thought that the differences in the view taken by the Government and the Opposition on this important and interesting subject of obtaining independent advice on company law reform were not too wide. I now recognise that the differences are not merely those of organisational structure, with the well known Opposition preference for setting up new quangos with formal independent powers of review and a requirement to publish recommendations, to be set against our proposals for a more informal panel, such as we described on Second Reading, which would respond to requests for advice from the Department as necessary and, of course—this is an important point—be supported by the research undertaken by Professor Gower. I am sure that the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) will agree that there is a warm welcome for the appointment of Professor Gower to this post.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 15, however, goes further and would require the Secretary of State to consult the standing advisory committee before proposing any changes in company law. This raises a difficult point. Does it mean that, without such consultation, no Government could legitimately come
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0364">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>665</span>
forward to Parliament with proposals for changes in the law? We know that the Opposition can do so and individual Members may do so, without constraint, and quite rightly—to say nothing of other agencies such as the EEC Commission. By this clause the hon. Gentleman is considerably restricting a basic right of the Government. The precise terms of this proposal therefore seem an extraordinary and unacceptable way of inhibiting the responsibility of Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has already been indicated, we do not consider it necessary to set up a permanent standing advisory committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary is really overstating the value of his own officials, whose track record on this matter of company law reform, with great respect to them, is not wholly commendable. In 1976 advice was proffered to the Government—which was wrong, in retrospect—that the 1976 Act should be curtailed to some minor reforms because it suited the Department to do it that way. The advice tendered to this Government has been equally disastrous, in that they were to truncate this Bill into dealing only with the second directive. The Insolvency Bill in 1976 was no great shakes either in its original form, and I had to review the whole of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister not think it would be of considerable value if the Department went out to consultation first so that we should not again be left in the ludicrous position in which this Committee finds itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was unfair and unfortunate that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that they should assume the entire responsibility, but the advice that was being tendered was inadequate. The Government have their business managers to deal with, and that is another inhibiting factor. There sits one of them. They do not have wisdom entirely on their side. They do not have a monopoly of it, and this is accepted, since otherwise the Government would not be asking Professor Gower to do the job they are asking of him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>666</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that we are moving on to dangerous ground. I am sure that the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) will recognise that much of the advice given him was of a confidential nature. We shall never know the answer whether it was right or wrong. I think that we are unwise to pursue it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not seek to pursue it, but the hon. Gentleman wants to be fair, I am sure, and from his experience he knows that there is a system of strong, almost exhaustive, consultation carried out by officials. There is a great willingness to consult, and the hon. Gentleman is absolutely correct to emphasise the importance of that. From my own experience, which is limited to a matter of months compared with his years, I entirely agree with him on the need for consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are occasions when that consultation is better on a confidential basis. I mention one practical example. In relation to the proceedings of the EEC Commission, it may not be desirable for certain aspects or views to be published. I ask the hon. Gentleman to consider that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was trying to show how, basically, our approach is different from the hon. Gentleman's strong emphasis on a formal quango-like approach, especially with the firm obligation for consultation by the Government before they can actually begin to move and to act in these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our approach is different because we believe in obtaining external advice. I realise, as the hon. Gentleman does, the need for a wide range of consultation. But there is a difficulty in formalising it, and I come back to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Baker). There can be almost unending claims by bodies to have representation on a formalised consultative committee, and people become dissatisfied if they do not seem to be getting representation, especially on a body which would have the power that the hon. Gentleman suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My experience in the past few months has been that there is certainly no shortage of well expressed and well publicised views on these important matters of company law. It is perfectly right—this is the principle that the hon. Gentleman has in mind and with which I agree—that the Secretary of State should always be willing to consider and take account of those
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0365">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>667</span>
views. Ultimately, as the hon. Gentleman knows, it comes to the hard question of decisions of policy when all these views are taken into account and a balance is struck.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With respect to the hon. Gentleman, I suggest that in the Bill and in the new clauses which we have been considering the Government have gripped a number of problems which have continued to exist for a long time, they are striking a balance and making decisions, steadily dealing with a number of questions which have been delayed for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that we in the Government believe in obtaining external advice, and we believe that this needs to be arranged—this is an important aspect of our approach—on a less ad hoc basis than hitherto. Hence, the proposal to set up an advisory panel which allows for more flexibility in its operation than the hon. Gentleman does in his proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We then come to the important governing principle, and I ask the Committee to take serious account of it. We believe that the Government, not an independent quango, however distinguished, should be responsible for publishing their proposals for company law reform. We welcome the publication of views, advice and opinions, and we want to take account of them, but when it comes to publishing proposals for company law reform, it is for the Government to take the responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all these reasons, we reject the proposals in this new clause, and I ask the Committee to take full account of the points that I have made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman come to the points that I raised as to his own proposals? How many informal advisers are to be incorporated in his panel? Where are they to be recruited from? Who are they? In particular, what are to be the inhibitions imposed on them in discussing matters while they are engaged in discussions with the Secretary of State and the Department?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman need have no fear that any of the independent advisers to whom we turn would be inhibited in the slightest in the advice that they give to the Secretary of State. As he well knows, a number of people representative of the whole range of professions and specialised interests, all of which would be consulted, are perfectly entitled to make
	<span class='label label-info column'>668</span>
their views public. This is absolutely correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman should realise that the over-formalised nature of his proposals would have an inhibiting effect in due course. Our system permits greater flexibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are features of new clause 15 which may not be entirely satisfactory. I think that the Minister has put his finger on a weakness in drawing attention to subsection (2), which might be held to inhibit the freedom of the Secretary of State to act in the field of company law without the sanction of the proposed committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) has done a service in drawing attention to the whole question of the future study of company law by the Department. I should not like it to be thought that anything I say now could be construed as a criticism of Professor Gower, whose work on company law I have studied with great interest and profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are factors which make it particularly important just at this time that the Department should be disposed to take a broader and more progressive approach to the reform of the law governing free enterprise. One of them, in particular, is our membership of the EEC, which is not only exposing many of our companies to acute competition but is also forcing us to bring our companies up to date and to consider the ways in which our law might be harmonised with the company law of other countries which may have been more progressive in such matters than we have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This process requires a broad public debate, not simply consultations behind closed doors. It is partly an educational process in that in this country we need to study the ways in which other countries have tackled company law and brought it into line with present-day requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What makes me nervous about my hon. Friend's proposals is that if one consults only the establishment one is likely to become reconciled to the status quo. If one goes to the academic or professional experts who know the situation inside out as it is, or if one turns to the people who have risen to the top in business or the professions through the system as it is, one will not get all the views which one needs to hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

to consider this? The Government have published a Green Paper, a consultative paper on the fourth directive, which has provided a great deal of information, and have asked for opinions across the whole range. It is a very wide-reaching consultative document.

It is inevitable that people who choose a career in the public service should have only a secondhand or distant knowledge of what happens in business because, by choosing from the start of their careers a different form of service, they do not have the personal experience which is acquired by people who go out into production, research, works management or whatever it may be and learn about free enterprise in the process of actually doing the job. Those who learn about industry from books or even from magazines and newspapers cannot have the intimate knowledge of the problems which arise which they would have had they started in the service of companies small or large.

It worries me that company law reform is an academic study and not a crusade. Of course, there are those who regard it as a crusade, and I am certainly one. There are others who have brought a political motivation to it, and I do not always agree with them. For instance, the campaign in support of the Bullock committee's proposals was disastrously wrong-headed. Thank goodness, it was resisted. But that does not mean that radical change is not required and that we can afford to coast along from year to year with the sort of Bill that was introduced to Parliament a few weeks ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Committee and pressure on the Department from all sides have resulted in the present Companies Bill being made a much more useful measure than it was as originally brought to Parliament. I do not
	<span class='label label-info column'>670</span>
like to criticise the Department—but by their fruits shall we know them. When the Department has an opportunity to bring in a major measure of company law reform and all it does is propose a Bill in the form in which it came to us from the House of Lords, one has to be concerned and to worry about whether enough pressure is being brought to bear on the decision-makers in the Department to meet the needs of the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was very disappointed with the Minister's approach. I ask him not to make a final decision now. Any amendments or new clauses put forward by any Opposition, who do not have the advantage of the skill available to parliamentary draftsmen, can be defective. The Minister has seized on subsection (2). I am perfectly prepared to concede that subsection (2) may be too firm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to reconsider his violent opposition to our proposal and agree that we might think about this further between now and Report, perhaps achieving a reconciliation of the views he has put forward today with those that I have put forward. I find the Minister's reasoning on this matter a little imperfect. Certainly, the officials do consult widely—there is no question about that—successive Governments put out consultative documents, and there is no lack of enterprise in that regards, but if everything is going so swimmingly why do the Government want Professor Gower at all? The answer to that question has not been given by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth is that the Department itself feels in need of the expert sustenance which Professor Gower and his team will be able to provide. I think that the Government are absolutely right about that, because the Department is under heavy burdens on a day-to-day basis. It does not have the ability of an independent group of people from outside who could keep a closer eye on the changes in company law as they unfold. After all, there will be a great desire to do that in the face of the tremendous changes that this Bill will provide. It is important that the Department should be able to receive the nourishment of outside people and independent ideas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government say they do not want to make the arrangements too formal. I do not see anything tremendously formal in our proposed committee. After all, it is not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0367">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>671</span>
dissimilar from a number of other bodies which the Government might describe as quangos but which they are retaining. The Pilotage Commission is one of the bodies introduced under the Merchant Shipping Act 1979, which the Government have said, in my. view absolutely properly, that they are retaining. It was described by the hon. Member for Wirral (Mr. Hunt) at the time as a quasi-qualified quango. I only wish he could be speaking on behalf of the Government today; we should have a much more sympathetic approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do not destroy my career.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the distinction? The Pilotage Commission is there to consider and to keep a constant watch on developments affecting its own jurisdiction. This body would be very similar in the form and composition it would take. The Government say in respect of one that they are prepared to accept the type of quango that the previous Government set up—indeed, they warmly welcome it—but in this case they want none of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister goes on to say that external advice is required. Ours is a better way of getting that external advice than the Government's proposal. He is right in saying that previously the way that external advice was obtained was on an ad hoc basis, which the Government now say ought to some extent to be qualified. I agree with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In principle, I do not suppose that there is all that much between us, though the Government broadened the differences in the debate this morning. The important question of publication is the issue that divides us. The Government may from time to time find it difficult to publish their own discussions that go on within the Department, because that would embarrass them in their negotiations with the EEC, but there are ways and means of over- coming that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the general principle, why does the Minister throw out this idea? Why is it so repugnant to the Administration that this body of advisers should be able to satisfy themselves that the consultations which they themselves would want to see happening are in fact undertaken by the Government in the broadest way? Why should they be constrained from being able to publish a note of their delibera-
	<span class='label label-info column'>672</span>
tions, and why should Parliament be prevented from knowing what is going on?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I certainly subscribe to the views of the hon. Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams), who, as the whole Committee will acknowledge, has during the whole of his Parliamentary career taken a profound look at matters affecting company law. He sees the deficiencies that exist. He sees this as a way of overcoming some of those deficiencies. It will not be a magic cure-all. Nobody is pretending that. We do not believe, however, that the sort of role that Professor Gower and his team are to undertake should be, if I may adopt his words, undertaken behind closed doors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude as I began by hoping that the Minister will respond by acknowledging that the Department has a difficult role and that is why he is utilising the efforts of Professor Gower, but, bearing that in mind, and bearing in mind the great difficulties which will certainly beset us in terms of company law in the light of the difficult new clauses which we have been considering and which have been passed by the Committee, it would be wise to think again. Let the Government get together with the Opposition and look at the matter before Report rather than jump into a hasty decision this morning. I would welcome that approach. I hope that it will be forthcoming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to respond as positively as I can to the hon. Gentleman but I have had to point out that there is a substantial defect in the new clause as drafted and it would have the objectionable aspect which I have mentioned. For this reason, I must ask the Committee to reject the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of consultation, I think that there is a great deal of common ground between us. We agree in principle on the need for wide consultation. I reject entirely any suggestion by the hon. Gentleman that I was saying that everything had gone swimmingly. That is not my view at all, especially about what has happened over the past five yéars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that there is opportunity for improvement, but I do suggest that Professor Gower's appointment and the arrangements that I have mentioned indicate that there is an opportunity to have a better system which could work better. I ask the hon. Gentleman to be patient and to give us a chance to get this system into
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0368">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>673</span>
operation, because I believe that it will lead to an improvement on what has happened in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ultimately, the essential requirement is good decisions on the part of Ministers. The hon. Gentleman knows that one must be fair to officials in this respect. They can only act in accordance with instructions and directions that are ultimately given to them by Ministers.

Division would result in the matter being given further consideration, which was my objective. As regards the matters covered by new clause 19, there is nothing too badly wrong with the people who direct British companies. Their problems all too frequently arise from the way in which they are organised. They cannot jointly achieve the level of performance of which individually they are inherently capable. The supervision and the resources available to the supervisory elements in British companies are inadequate. In due course, I believe, this country will move towards something very like the two-tier board. In the meantime, we have a duty to make the operation of companies under unitary boards as efficient as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of the new clause is that public companies should be obliged to prepare the necessary data to allow a reasonable assessment to be made of the future profitability of the company and its ability to pay its debts as they fall due. In common prudence, this should be done as a matter of course. A significant number of companies do not do the job thoroughly and realistically. It is vital for management to have as clear an idea as possible of the company's future standing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For decisions affecting investment, price policy and wages policy, the company must know what the future holds in store, or at least must organise the data within its possession to extract from it the most realistic assessment that is possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 7 December the financial section of 	<i>The Guardian</i> had the headline:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If an individual company behaved like Britain's industry what would its bank say?"</p></blockquote>
I shall read one paragraph from this interesting article:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Why, it will be pertinent to ask, are companies conceding wage claims of anything up to 20 per cent. when they are clearly not in a position to pay them? It may be partly because financial weakness makes them want to avoid a costly strike at all costs. But it is also partly because (as the Governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor have recently hinted) companies are judging their ability to pay on the basis of profits at historic prices and not adjusted to the rapidly escalating inflation now being encountered. Those using last year's Bradshaw should be unsurprised if the train does not reach its destination."</p></blockquote>
I do not think I could put in better words the feelings of anxiety I have had about the way in which all too many boards are approaching their policy, even over as short a future period as the next few
	<span class='label label-info column'>676</span>
months, without having a complete comprehension of the true facts of their financial situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perfectly true that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England are bringing pressure on companies to prevent inflationary wage settlements and inefficient operation. But the Department of Trade could be making its own major contribution as well. It would cost nothing to incorporate a new clause on the lines that I am suggesting in the present Companies Bill, but it could be very helpful in many problem cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause originated as part of my series of Bills to strengthen the supervision of company management and, in particular, to give more authority and effectiveness to outside directors. But even in companies which do not have outside directors the preparation of data and estimates for the benefit of the directors is obviously necessary. I believe that it is best to improve the background of company data which has to be prepared, or ought to be prepared, for the whole board, as a regular practice. By involving the auditors, my new clause would give a more professional style to the forecasts in very many cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I say a few words about the role of the auditors under the provisions of the clause. The auditors, following the guidelines of the Companies Act, tend to avoid involvement in managerial decisions and look backward at facts rather than forward at guesswork. These attitudes are deeply ingrained in many eminent and highly professional chartered and other qualified accountants. But professionalism is necessary, too, when forecasts have to be made. The auditors should be encouraged to bring their professional competence to the service and the disciplines of the company's financial forecasting procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I quote next an article which appeared in 	<i>The Times</i>on Monday under the headline,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Can accountants stand the culture shock?"</p></blockquote>
This was an extremely interesting piece, which I am sure hon. Members have seen, by Mr. Michael Julien, finance director of BICC. I shall quote only one sentence from his article:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The need to produce meaningful and constructive information as an aid to decision-making requires much greater emphasis than ever before.</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0370">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>677</span>
I feel that that remark shows that my new clause 19 is timely and ought to be given serious consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of the company producing a prospectus for a public issue of shares, the auditors now have to lend their names to the figures. It often causes concern to reputable firms to be associated with forecasts which later turn out to have been wrong. So this is a sensitive area. But I should point out that in my new clause there is no question of disclosure of information. It is particularly provided that the data and estimates produced in response to the requirements of the clause are in no circumstances to be published. It is purely for the guidance of those in charge of the firm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, the auditors do not have to produce the figures themselves or even approve them; they merely have to take a view of the kind of forecasting procedures that the company ought to be adopting, having regard to the board's own opinion, the nature of the company's undertakings and the cost of preparation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, as a safeguard to the auditors, I am proposing in subsection (4) only that they should be required to state in their report if in their opinion the company's forecasting procedures are falling below what is needed in all the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have obviously asked myself whether the passage of the new clause might result in company reports being peppered with criticisms by the auditors, whether the auditors might find that their relationships with their clients were becoming strained, or whether they might be accused of making work for themselves unnecessarily. I am sure that none of these things would be likely any more than the existing provisions of the Companies Act to create problem situations of that kind between management and auditors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Management accepts the value of the work done by the auditors and knows that it benefits the company. I believe that auditors ought not to be left without any remedy if they become convinced that a company, whose shareholders they are retained to serve, is not acting wisely in regard to its future commitments. I hope therefore that my hon. Friend will be able to give a favourable response to my new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause reminds me of an agreement I drafted once for an
	<span class='label label-info column'>678</span>
Irishman, whose silicitor's comments on that agreement I happened to see. He commented, on looking at the agreement, that this was the kind of document that was the cause of so much trouble and strife in the world today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) is trying to move company law into the direction of telling managers how to manage companies. This is to raise expectations which will inevitably be dashed. First, it is trespassing on the proper business of people who manage companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, I question whether auditors could possibly undertake the dangerous and risky work implied under subsection (1). They are required to give an opinion here which I should have thought went much further than the kind of opinion they are required to give on figures at present. I should be interested to know the views of my hon. Friend the Minister for Trade, who is himself an accountant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all on this Committee regard my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) as a fount of interesting new ideas. I hope he will not mind my saying that some of his ideas are better than others. I must tell him straight away that I do not think that this is one of his better ideas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend argues that it is important for companies to look ahead to anticipate their problems and to have a clear idea about where they are going. He is absolutely right in that. Boards of directors do that. But it seems to me that in arriving at decisions of that sort not all the facts they have to take into account are financial. One cannot reduce such an assessment to a set of statistics which the auditor can audit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about the future and trying to project where the company will be. To put a duty on the auditor to give his stamp of approval to something which must inevitably be to some extent conjectural is, I believe, to give a spurious authenticity to a document which at best will be a guesstimate. Therefore, I believe that it is, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Baker) said, unfair to impose on auditors a duty to stamp with their seal of approval something which must have a great element of conjecture and speculation about it. One cannot be certain about the future, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0371">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>679</span>
one's ideas about it can only be projections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel, therefore, that the idea that the auditors should be called on to take on this new job will be very difficult for them. It seems to me that my hon. Friend is underestimating the job of the auditor at present, in that the auditor, in forming his view about whether the balance sheet offers a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs, takes into account that balance sheets are prepared on a going-concern basis. He takes into account whether the company can meet its debts and so on at the balance sheet date, and whether the balance sheet prepared at that date offers a true and fair view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the auditor is not satisfied that the company will be able to meet its debts in future, that would be something that he would have to report to the shareholders and tell them about. He is taking into account, to some extent, the company's ability to meet its debts and to carry on in business. What he is not doing is saying that all this data which my hon. Friend wishes to see directors assemble, which he specifies fairly clearly, is reliable and something to which on the whole, he can as auditor give his blessing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand why my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington is putting such stress on the secrecy of this information. In our consultative document on company accounting and disclosure we proposed that the company should give more information about borrowings, leasing arrangements and other financial commitments. We want that information to be provided to the shareholders. We are anxious that they should be told more about their business and, as he knows, companies will be required, under article 46(2) of the fourth directive, to include in the directors' report—which the auditors, of course, do not certify—an indication of the company's likely future development. No responsible board could do this without having considered the evidence available to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All we are saying is that in most businesses what my hon. Friend wants in fact happens. In planning the future of the company, directors are looking ahead. What we do not see is how this statutory requirement will help, and how imposing a duty on the auditors to carry out something which will be very difficult for them to do will again be much help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now understand what my hon. Friend's motive was. I must be truthful; before he
	<span class='label label-info column'>680</span>
moved his new clause, I did not. I do not, however, believe that adding the clause to the body of our company law will do much for anybody, and I advise my hon. Friend's to resist it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister not think there is an element of inconsistency in objecting, on the one hand, that auditors cannot be expected to peer into the future and certify future assessments, while pointing out, on the other, that auditors frequently gaze into the future in such matters as valuations? What is a valuation except an assessment of what someone in the future would be likely to pay for an asset?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I just clear up a point on which I may have misled the Committee? The auditors will, though they do not at present, certify the directors' report. When we implement the fourth directive they will do so. I did not mislead the Committee about the present state of the law, but I did mislead it about what the law will be in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is one thing for an auditor reporting on the accounts of the previous year to take note of the existing assets and liabilities of the company and to work out whether the company has liabilities which, on the basis of the facts in front of him, it will not be able to meet. This is something that one can do with a fair degree of certainty on the basis of a going concern. However, actually to put the stamp of approval on a collection of data of the kind that my hon. Friend outlines in his new clause is quite different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the one case, the auditor is taking a situation and saying "This company is going to continue with these assets. Can it meet those commitments?" If he thinks, on the basis of the assets as he sees them in front of him and the commitments as known to him, that it cannot, he is under a duty to report to the shareholders that in his opinion it is not likely to be able to. That is on the basis of known facts and known liabilities. In my opinion, my hon. Friend's proposal would extend the auditor's duties to a point that most auditors would find themselves pressed to comply with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether my hon. Friend—I cannot imagine that he will not reply to that, and I hope he will—will tell me whether he has discussed the new clause with the accountancy profession, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0372">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>681</span>
whether auditors feel that they could carry out the obligations which he is seeking to impose on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I want to say—I shall confine my remarks on this occasion to about 30 seconds—is that I think that the ideas which have been explored by the hon. Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) have been treated in too negative a fashion by the Minister. The hon. Gentleman has put forward ideas which I would not endorse in every particular, but I feel that the broad nature of what he has said ought to be supported, and we on this side of the Committee therefore will give him our support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Bright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little concerned about how this clause would affect small businesses. It would impose a great deal of responsibility on the auditor to look into the future, and the future of a small business is, by its very nature, precarious. It could depend perhaps on one order for the supplying of one company. A small business could depend entirely on the efforts of one director and, if that director were to go off the scene or to die suddenly, obviously the whole situation would be changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us face it—auditors, particularly those dealing with small companies, are dealing not with one company but sometimes with many hundreds. It can run into 1,000 or more during the course of a year. I think that, from that angle, my hon. Friend's proposal would impose on auditors conditions that would be impossible to fulfil. They would be making suggestions, they would be merely surmising, and I do not think that a report of this nature would be worth the paper it was written on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very concerned that to impose that on an auditor would not be fair. I think that the responsibilities are with the directors, and one would have thought, considering everything else that goes in the Companies Bill, that a director could face up to those responsibilities without this clause being added.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with great interest to the comments of my colleagues on the Committee, and I accept that they come to the subject with very specific knowledge of what goes on in
	<span class='label label-info column'>682</span>
companies. But, with respect, I think that they have not actually read my new clause quite closely enough and have omitted to recognise that, in the course of consultation with people who have a profound knowledge of the interests of the accountancy profession and of the way it works, I have made amendments and modified the text to meet precisely the sort of objections that they are making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, East (Mr. Bright) referred to the difficulty of applying such a measure to small companies. I think that he did not notice that it is only every public company which would be caught by the clause. But, even if he did, once a company is public, it does, I feel, have a duty to the shareholders and indeed to the economy as a whole at the very least to make a reasonable assessment of the future profitability of the company and of its abilities to pay its debts as they fall due.

I cannot believe that my hon. Friend is seeking to come to the rescue of a firm which does not have a professional system or even any system to enable it to make a reasonable assessment of the future profitability of the company. I cannot believe that he is reconciled to the idea that public companies should be coasting along from one year to the next without making any serious effort to form a long-term view of their power to survive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Baker), how has he brought himself to support any of the amendments to company law that we have agreed in this Committee in the last few weeks if he thinks that company law is not intended to guide management as to how they should run their businesses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In some cases I have been brought to support the clauses with difficulty. I believe strongly that where, for example, in relation to insider dealing we believe that certain conduct is wrong, we should provide penalites for people who do wrong, but what we should not do—I made this very point in an earlier comment—is seek to guide managers of companies as to how to do their job. The more I look at this clause, the more worried I am about it because it is trying to tell managers how to run their companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely accept what my hon. Friend said in quoting the comment from the newspaper, that using yesterday's Brad-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0373">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>683</span>
shaw as a guide to tomorrow's trains, or whatever it was, is unreliable. I entirely agree, but the responsibility must fall on the people who run the business and not on the auditors or anybody else. Those are the people who have the worry and the sweat and, in the end, a reasonable part of the profits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to go on, but my hon. Friend also mentioned public companies and small companies. I happened to open a public company's new premises in my constituency on Friday. The company will only ever employ in the foreseeable future 20 or 30 people, but it is none the less a small public company. This is the kind of work that the directors and managers are doing and redoing—that is, preparing data and estimates—day after day; every month they are reviewing their position. I do not think that they will be helped by this new clause. They will be inhibited, and I think that this is not a helpful clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the case that my hon. Friend has mentioned the auditors would have no possible scope for complaint, but if the auditors became concerned that a company was not carrying out the bare minimum of procedures to ensure its future profitability, they ought not to be caught in a position where they have no remedy, no way in which they can advise the shareholders that a problem will, in their opinion, emerge in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has mistaken the obligations that would fall upon the auditors under the terms of my new clause. The auditors are not being asked to stamp the figures with their approval. They are merely asked to agree tacitly that the procedure which the company uses in order to forecast the future is reasonable, and in subsection (3) I have given the auditors wide latitude as to whether they should take any steps to warn the shareholders that they feel that the company is not carrying out what would constitute professional business practice in forecasting its future profitability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In regard to what my hon. Friend said about secrecy, there is, of course, a place for disclosure in company law and many people think there should be more disclosure. I rather doubt the value of more disclosure in company statements, but the sort of data which the company needs to prepare are things which are bound to be confidential—sales forecasts, estimates of market share, profit margins and such
	<span class='label label-info column'>684</span>
matters. It would be totally inconceivable that we could ask companies to publish all that to the wide world, including their competition. That is why I have emphasised that this information must be kept secret. It is not only to protect the auditors from any complaint that they have approved figures which afterwards turn out to be wrong; this is information which the company cannot be required to disclose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nobody has mentioned in this short debate the question of limited liability and its implications, but when we are talking about company law we must never forget privilege of limited liability which we give to companies, and now, through the extension of case law, limited liability does not apply only to the shareholders but applies also in large measure to the directors. They are very largely protected against actions from shareholders or other parties by the precedents which have, quite rightly, been established by the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a situation in which, I believe, the majority of companies are now conforming fully with what one might hope they would do in the way of forecasting their future position. But there are some—I am sure we all know that there are some—which are not doing it. How do we propose to remedy that situation? If we do not call in the auditors in the limited terms of my new clause, on whom can we depend? Alternatively, is my hon. Friend content that private enterprise should carry these passengers into the future with the inevitable bankruptcies and inefficiencies that that involves?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not impressed by the arguments that have been advanced this morning. I ask the Committee to support the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This must be one of the rare occasions when neither my hon. Friend nor I are impressed with each other's arguments, because I am certainly not impressed with his. May I read his new clause to him?—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the directors of every public company shall secure and collate not less than once in each accounting reference period"—</p></blockquote>
I am quite sure it will be the first time that my hon. Friend has heard it straight—
	<br><blockquote><p>"such data about the company's affairs and transactions and those of its subsidiaries and prepare such estimates of the future course of the business as in the opinion of the auditors … are required to allow a reasonable assessment to be made".</p></blockquote>

	<span class='label label-info column'>685</span>
What my hon. Friend is saying is that auditors should be the people who have the last word about what information directors need to take decisions about how to run the business and what is likely to happen to it. My hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Baker) is absolutely right. That is the duty of the directors. They are elected by the shareholders to manage the shareholders' assets and to account to them He grossly overestimates the capacity of the auditor and his duty to decide what data the directors need so that they can make up their minds about the future profitability of the business. Most auditors do not and would not feel equipped to tell the directors what information they ought to be taking into account in arriving at decisions about the company's future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assumption must be that one of the reasons for their being appointed directors is that they actually have the ability to take the right decisions, to take a view about the company's future, and to make the necessary plans. How can some young man, descending from the City for a few days and having a look round, say to the board of directors "I have given this my considered view, and this is the sort of data that you had better put together, and ought to put together, before you can arrive at a reasonable estimate or view of the company and its prospects."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>686</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) is aware of the professional time that is taken up—my hon. Friend the Minister will have something to say about this, I am sure—by auditors and solicitors acting for a public company in deciding how they can qualify their accounts and the exact nature and terms of the opinion which they as auditors can give about a company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a matter of fine professional discussion as to how that judgment can be arrived at. We are talking about a true and fair view of the accounts of a company as things are at present. The clause talks about the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder also whether my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington is aware of the enormous claims currently being made against leading accountancy firms which would make them even more worried about giving an opinion under this clause that would be of any use to anyone at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
