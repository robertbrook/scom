</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the gong rang for lunch I was running through the views of a number of major organisations that disagreed with the Government's proposal to repeal in its entirety this part of the existing legislation. I referred to the Engineering Employers Federation, the British Institute of Management, the Confederation of British Industry, the TUC Low Pay Unit, and the Warwick University unit.<br><br>
I was about to quote from two prominent employers' spokesmen who had recently addressed a conference of the Institute of Personnel Management—Mr. Nick Cowan, who is a member of EAT and also secretary and director-designate at the Federation of London Clearing Bank Employers, and Mr. Pat Lowry, who is well known as British Leyland's personnel director and a prominent member of the Confederation of British Industry.<br><br>
Mr. Cowan said schedule 11
<br><blockquote><p>"had been unloved by all (employers) but it had been a safety valve "—</p></blockquote>
that phrase occurs again—
<br><blockquote><p>"during incomes policy which took the lid off some potentially explosive situations. That was
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1646</span>
why there had so often been collusion between employers and unions.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Now however, they had not only abolished the 'general level' provision but the 'recognised terms and conditions' as well. This was an intolerable situation.".</p></blockquote>
Mr. Lowry agreed with those sentiments and said:
<br><blockquote><p>"By abolishing these"—</p></blockquote>
recognised terms and conditions
<br><blockquote><p>"as well as the general level allowed for by Schedule 11, the Government was throwing out the baby with the bathwater."</p></blockquote>
That is a phrase I have often used myself.
<br><blockquote><p>"In fragmented industries like road haulage"—</p></blockquote>
he mentioned road haulage particularly—
<br><blockquote><p>'the situation could be made even more chaotic If there were no recognised levels of pay and conditions.".</p></blockquote>
Those are two well-known employer representatives putting a view adverse to that of the Government.<br><br>
There is also the view of the Managerial Professional Staff Liaison Group. I have been reluctant to quote that body, and perhaps I do not need to press that point with the Committee. Members of that group are clearly not what one would call mainstream trade unionists in the sense we normally understand it. In referring to schedule 11 the group states:
<br><blockquote><p>"We strongly oppose the repeal of schedule 11 of the Employment Protection Act, and wish to see the use of arbitration made more available in the settlement of disputes.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Your implied suggestion"—</p></blockquote>
they are commenting on the Government's proposals—
<br><blockquote><p>"that pockets of low pay relate only to those below average earnings is questioned, since pockets of low pay exist at all levels of remuneration. Professional and managerial staff are particularly prone to this, and the retention of schedule 11 provides a reasonable method of ironing out anomalies.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>It should be noted that the making of a schedule 11 claim is not an easy option, and necessitates a considerable amount of research and presentation of evidence for the claim to be successful.".</p></blockquote>
I refer also to the paper submitted by the Camden Committee for Community Relations. I shall not read all of it because the Secretary of State was certainly sent a copy. No doubt the hon. and learned Gentleman will have a copy, too. The committee wrote to me—other members of the Committee may also have received it—because they regarded me as their local Member, or as near to local as they could get because Camden is next door to Islington. The Camden committee certainly sent a copy
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1387">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1647</span>
of the document to the Secretary of State, but I am not sure whether it was circulated in this Committee<br><br>
The Camden Committee for Community Relations had this to say about the Camden and central London areas:
<br><blockquote><p>"many workers from ethnic minority groups are employed in the low-paid hotel, catering and garment trades. They work in small units and are not organised within trade unions"—</p></blockquote>
that is mostly so
<br><blockquote><p>"therefore being unable to effectively negotiate with management for better conditions. Minimum terms and conditions for these trades are agreed by Wages Councils under the Wages Council Act 1959 (amended 1979). By the very nature of this Act, the terms and conditions of employment specified by the Councils are a legally enforceable minimum, and do not represent a 'good' or even `satisfactory' level.".</p></blockquote>
The letter also states:
<br><blockquote><p>"However, Schedule 11 does not give enough benefit to those employed in low paid industries. In the fragmented small hotel, catering and garment trades, there are very few strongly unionised units, therefore there are very few good collective agreements which could be cited for comparison. Also, claims on 'General Terms' fall down because it is hard to compare like with like when each establishment is unique, being independent. Industrial Tribunals have failed to aid low paid workers because there have been few valid claims submitted and they have only had the Wages Council minimum as a comparison.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Certainly Part II of Schedule 11 has very rarely been used, and whilst claims can be under part I, this was the Part designed specifically for those covered by the Wages Council Act (and other similar Acts) giving what was originally thought to be more useful conditions for a claim.".</p></blockquote>
The letter then states that despite these shortcomings—clearly in the Camden committee's view and probably in mine there are considerable shortcomings in schedule 11—
<br><blockquote><p>"these shortcomings do not lead us to believe that Schedule 11 should be repealed as we see it as being a sensible provision for arbitration".</p></blockquote>
The committee then makes a series of suggestions which I shall not give in detail. It opposes the repeal of schedule 11 and suggests that there should be discussions on it, inviting contributions from everyone concerned—employers, unions and,
<br><blockquote><p>"considering the larger number of ethnic minority workers concerned, all involved in work amongst the ethnic minority communities".</p></blockquote>
That is yet another view. It is a good example of those who have particular experience of the ethnic minority groups—certainly in central London.<br><br>
Since we are against the repeal, we
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1648</span>
therefore have to ask how we deal with schedule 11. I suggest that it is not that schedule 11 has been tried and failed; it is that it has not been adequately tried. In so far as it has been used, broadly speaking, it has helped the low paid—those earning below the average. I believe that the evidence I quoted—particularly the latest evidence which the Low Pay Unit has produced from Warwick—conclusively proves that point.<br><br>
The Low Pay Unit's comment is that we are turning the clock back to the 1930s by going this way. It certainly means that those who are not working on Government contracts will not be able to claim fair wages with minimum standards. Bad employers will be able to undercut. As a consequence, good employers—responsible employers—will be adversely affected. If that is the kind of competitive rat race which the Government welcome—the back to the sweat shop kind of approach—I find it hard to understand.<br><br>
The Low Pay Unit, in the excellent brief which it provided for the Committee, made a number of suggestions for improvement. The document said that schedule 11 should be widened rather than abolished if the Government wish to help the low paid It also pointed out that at the moment the Government's own employees and those covered by statutory arrangements such as health service workers, teachers and policemen are excluded. Workers covered by wages councils have to satisfy almost impossible criteria to use schedule 11.<br><br>
That was the same point as the Camden people made.<br><br>
It goes on:
<br><blockquote><p>"If it were to be widened to include this group it could be far more helpful to the low paid.".</p></blockquote>
There is a final suggestion that schedule 11 should be levelled upwards to the Fair Wages Resolution 1946, which
<br><blockquote><p>"would allow workers not employed on public contracts to claim that the fair wage for the job was the general level rather than the national collective agreement.".</p></blockquote>
It continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"At present only private sector workers who are not covered by national collective agreements can claim under the general level provision unless the national agreement does not specify rates of pay for specific groups and is therefore deemed not to define recognised terms and conditions. This would bring private sector workers up to the level of their fellow workers on Government contracts under the Fair Wages Resolution of 1946.".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1388">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1649</span>
It is fair to say that the TUC also believes that the schedule's limited scope has led to problems.<br><br>
I mentioned the Fair Wages Resolution. I should like to ask the Minister what the Government's intention will be if that is repealed. Will there simply be a vacuum? The implication of the consultative document is that the Fair Wages Resolution may go as well in due course. That would weaken a measure which protects employees on Government contracts from exploitation and deals with undercutting. It is a case of the Government's setting a good example, which is highly desirable in employment.<br><br>
We are signatories to ILO Convention 94. Again, from the consultative document it seems that the Government believe that they will be able to wriggle out of their obligations under that convention in some legalistic way. If that is what is contemplated—it would be good to have an assurance to the contrary from the hon. and learned Gentleman—that is a sorry condemnation of this country's stance towards such matters in the international community.<br><br>
I go further and would like to see Government contracts used far more vigorously in employment in connection with race relations, the disabled, and so on. I would be extremely hostile to its being watered down in that way.<br><br>
I shall make only passing reference to the Road Haulage Wages Act because my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) will deal in more detail with that aspect of the matter. But I cannot see why the Government want to repeal that legislation. I do not regard it as anything other than a smack at the Transport and General Workers Union. Perhaps the Minister will be able to give us another and more valid reason.<br><br>
The consultative document makes no attempt to give any reason. It just mentions in passing that there will be a repeal and that is the end of the matter. The explanatory memorandum seems to make out a fairly good case for retaining the legislation. It refers to the fact that the Wages Council was abolished in 1978 and says that since then access to the Act's wider provisions has effectively been given for the first time to all drivers, including those who had earlier been unable to gain any practical benefit from them because of the existence of wages regulation orders. It points that in 1978–79 eight awards were
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1650</span>
made under the Act.<br><br>
Now that there is no Wages Council I should have thought there was all the more point in retaining the legislation so that workers who were not covered—we have examples of the way in which the Road Haulage Act has been used—would be looked after. But no doubt my hon. Friend will make out a much more detailed case on that.<br><br>
I turn to the details of the amendment. Amendment No. 183 says, in effect, "Let us keep the Act—we do not want any change." Amendment No. 182 will be covered by my hon. Friend in much more detail. New clause 14 loses only the general level provision. I believe that it would be a backward step to exclude all those employees not covered by multi-employer agreements. That would create two classes of workers—those covered by industry agreements, who would be protected, and those in firms that bargain at local level, who would not be protected.<br><br>
New clause 14 is our very reluctant fall back position which I believe would reduce the damage. It would still leave a reprehensible situation that nevertheless, would be better than nothing and if the Government would go even that far we would be unhappy but at least we would not be entirely ungrateful, which is perhaps a better way of putting it.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 188 and 189 are consequential so I do not need to go into them.<br><br>
In conclusion, if the clause goes through unamended in the way the Government propose that will be a black day for the low paid. Perhaps one could say that it will be the second consecutive black day for the low paid after the statement made yesterday by the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the consequences of that for low paid people in general. That dovetails with the general approach of the Government—these matters do not seem to concern them greatly—but I believe that it is a mean-minded attack on vulnerable people who cannot adequately look after themselves. That certainly seems to be in line with the Government's current philosophy.<br><br>
The Secretary of State seemed prepared to describe himself as a wet hawk this morning. Whether he is a wet hawk or not, I am surprised that he lent himself to this sort of nastiness. He cannot always pretend to be the good guy but must take
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1389">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1651</span>
some of the responsibility in these matters. This is a nasty piece of work by the Government.<br><br>
If the Government are prepared to make concessions they cannot say that the employers will mind. It will be welcomed by all. the people I mentioned. Those of us who care about these matters and about the position of the low paid in particular are utterly opposed to what the Government seek to do in this part of the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Goodhew. An entirely separate matter has just been brought to my attention regarding amendment No. 195. I do not want to trespass on the substance of that now, as we shall be coming to it in due course. The amendment appears on the Amendment Paper in the name of myself and my non. Friends. I would not like anyone—either in the Committee or outside—to believe for one moment that we had any responsibility for this amendment. May we have this matter corrected, please?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman can be assured that this is just a printing error. He will see on the Chairman's selection list that amendment No. 15 is down as a Government amendment. That is now on the record, which I hope will make the right hon. Gentleman happy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) has indicated, I shall be referring mainly to amendment No. 182 which deals with the Road Haulage Wages Act but I shall necessarily have to refer once or twice to schedule 11.<br><br>
I believe that I should make a preliminary point. Amendment No. 182 is, of course, a matter of particular concern to the Transport and General Workers Union by which I am sponsored. People who will be adversely affected by this repeal contributed to my election expenses and to that extent I have an interest, which I now declare.<br><br>
In discussing the amendments to clause 16(<i>c</i>), we are talking about the concept of fair wages. I think it fair to remind the Committee that this is an old tradition in this country. The concept of a fair day's pay for a fair day's work is centuries old. The tradition goes back at least to the days of the Plantagenet kings—whether it is even earlier than that I am not sure, but
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1652</span>
It is at least that old. There are examples of orders made in those days to preserve the notion of fair wages and the idea that people should not be paid less than the proper rate for the job.<br><br>
It is unfortunate that the Government propose such a dramatic change in a position that has existed in this country for centuries, whether enshrined in statute or not—and it has certainly been enshrined in statute for the past 50 years, at least. It is clearly in the interests of employers and trade unions that these legislative provisions are retained.<br><br>
Schedule 11 is the major provision of recent times. Paragraph 3 of schedule 11 specifically excludes people working in areas where similar protection is provided in another way. The Road Haulage Wages Act is perhaps the best example of that kind of special protection which at this stage is outside the terms of schedule 11.<br><br>
The explanatory notes given to the Committee by the Secretary of State say that the Road Haulage Wages Act has not been widely used in recent years. That was true up to the time the wages council for that industry was abolished in 1978. I understand that it has been used much more since then because the abolition of the wages council left the Act as the only legal protection for road haulage workers. Therefore the Act was used more often.<br><br>
There appears to be a discrepancy between the Secretary of State's notes and what the TUC has said. I say "appears to be" because it may be that the two sets of figures can be reconciled. The notes state that in 1978 and 1979, eight awards were made under the Act—eight in two years. The TUC states that there were 25 claims under the Act in 1978 and more than 60 in 1979. There is a big gap between eight awards in two years and approximately 90 claims in two years.<br><br>
I do not say that they are irreconcilable. Many of the claims may have been settled before an award had to be made. I do not say that the two claims are necessarily at variance but it seems to understate the importance of the Act merely to say that eight awards were made if, in fact, 85 to 90 claims were settled before the Central Arbitration Committee had to make an award. That does not in my view invalidate or reduce the importance of the Road Haulage Wages Act; certainly it is regarded by the people in the industry as of great importance.<br><br>
I do not wish to bore the Committee
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1390">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1653</span>
with a catalogue of the claims that have been dealt with, but I will mention one, which is also in the Secretary of State's notes. It provided a settlement for haulage workers in the milk industry. It was dealt with in January 1979, which is not a long time ago, and there is no doubt that the Act was used most effectively in that case. It provided a means of settling what could have been a difficult dispute.<br><br>
The CAC drew attention to one technical difficulty in the Act. It was not a difficulty in practice, but looked difficult on paper. It was the fact that claims had to be referred on an individual basis. This was easily dealt with by both parties to the argument accepting from the start that any award made would apply to workers similar to those to whom the award was made in individual terms. Any workers falling within the scope of the national joint negotiating council for the milk industry would thereby be covered.<br><br>
The Secretary of State's notes also say that the CAC had agreed that the terms and conditions agreed in the hire and reward sector of the industry between the unions and the Road Haulage Association would be regarded as the yardstick. Not only the CAC said that: the two parties in the argument also said so.<br><br>
The two sides agreed from the start that this was the proper yardstick to use, although it is true that they put a somewhat different emphasis on it. Nevertheless that was the basis—and a very sound basis—on which the Committee was able to reach its conclusions.<br><br>
It is not necessary for me to go through all the considerations that the Committee took into account. My point is simply that the existence of the Royal Haulage Wages Act—the legislation that the Government wish to scrap—made it possible in that case, as in many others, for a proper settlement to be peacefully agreed. Without any need for recourse to strike action, a settlement acceptable to both sides was produced.<br><br>
If at that time the Road Haulage Wages Act had not been in existence, the problem could have been dealt with under schedule 11 of the 1975 Act. But now the Government wish to abolish that as well. They propose to wipe out the whole legislative basis for the implementation of the fair wages concept. That is sheer folly. It is bound to lead to more difficulty in settling industrial disputes.<br><br>
It would be appropriate at this point
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1654</span>
for me to refer briefly to section 8 of the Terms and Conditions of Employment Act 1959—not because it is still in existence, but precisely because it is not. It was repealed, and its provisions were enlarged and extended and incorporated in schedule 11, which the Government now wish to scrap. But the 1959 Act, which was in force at the time of the Donovan commission, was referred to at length many times in the Donovan report, which is still the most authoritative work in existence on the whole question of industrial relations.<br><br>
I do not propose to read long extracts from the Donovan report. No doubt that will be to your relief, Mr. Goodhew, and that of the Committee. But I ought to make one or two references to the Report. The first reference to the Terms and Conditions of Employment Act 1959 occurs very early in the report—in paragraph 41 on page 10. In paragraph 40 it is stated that:
<br><blockquote><p>"Parliament has long been committed to the view that the best means of settling such questions"—</p></blockquote>
problems of industrial relations
<br><blockquote><p>"is voluntary collective bargaining"—</p></blockquote>
that is something about which all the members of the Committee agree—
<br><blockquote><p>"and has equipped Governments in various ways to support, assist and promote collective bargaining.".</p></blockquote>
That is precisely what we are talking about. We are not proposing that legislative machinery should supersede voluntary collective bargaining. We are saying that it should be there to support, assist and promote it.<br><br>
Paragraph 41 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"One example of support for collective agreements is the Fair Wages Resolution of the House of Commons. The first was passed in 1891".</p></blockquote>
That shows that we are not talking about anything new. After a brief reference to the Fair Wages Resolution, paragraph 41 continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"Other examples are the Terms and Conditions of Employment Act 1959, under which an employer may be required under certain conditions to observe terms and conditions not less favourable than those established for his trade or industry by collective bargaining; and the statutory obligation placed on the boards of nationalised industries to seek agreement with trade unions over the establishment of negotiating machinery for settling terms and conditions of work for their employees."</p></blockquote>
The authors of the Donovan report refer to the Act many times, and always in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1391">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1655</span>
approving terms. Clearly they felt it to be an important piece of legislative machinery. But they stated that there was a need to extend it and to remove some of the restrictions then operating within it—for example, the fact that it could not deal with any industry where there was a wages council.<br><br>
Their final recommendation on this point, in paragraph 10.31 of the report, says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Section 8 of the Terms and Conditions of Employment Act 1959, under which an employer may be required to observe the relevant terms and conditions for his industry, should be amended: it should be made available for use in Wages Council industries (paragraph 265); and in the consideration of claims not only the particular term or condition to which the claim relates but the terms and conditions laid down by collective agreement as a whole should have to be taken into account."</p></blockquote>
There are many references to that Act in the report. But at no stage did Donovan suggest that we could do without the basis the underpinning, of collective bargaining provided by such legislation. As I have just read out, the committee said that it should be amended by being extended in scope. In schedule 11 to the 1975 Act the then Government did precisely that.<br><br>
5 p.m.<br><br>
Now we are faced with a proposal to abolish the whole lot. The Opposition are particularly worried about that. It is not a matter of making some minor tinkering amendments. Everything is to be knocked out. Yet, as I and my hon. Friend have tried to show, it has all been developed from a sound historical base.<br><br>
We accept that there is a need for further refinement and amendment of schedule 11. But simply to scrap it is to go in the face of history. It puts the clock back not just several years—as many parts of the Bill do—but several centuries. Parliament is to deny the very concept of fair wages which, whether it was in statutes or not, has in practice been with us for centuries. It existed long before 1930, which was, I believe, the date of the first statute to take it into account.<br><br>
To say that all that can be scrapped altogether is sheer madness. It will inevitably lead to more industrial disputes. It will create positions in which trade unions will be forced to have recourse to strike action. There will be no other way of settling a dispute.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1656</span>
It should not be imagined that only people whose wages and conditions are below the proper standard will be affected. Those who are enjoying proper terms and conditions will be affected as well. They will not stand idly by and see a firm in competition with their employer undercutting wages and conditions and thereby distorting competition. People who enjoy proper terms and conditions because those have been negotiated by their trade unions will not allow that kind of thing to happen. They will take action to ensure that they are not undercut by others. No one should imagine that only a small number of people will be affected by the repeals. They will affect almost everybody in one way or another.<br><br>
Do Government hon. Members really want to make strikes more likely? There is no doubt that they will do that if they destroy those provisions in the present legislation. I hope that even at this stage they will think again. If they do not decide to keep schedule 11 as it is they could at least give us an undertaking that they will bring it back in an amended form. I hope that they will also retain the Road Haulage Wages Act—again, possibly with some amendments. To scrap the whole thing is madness; that is how I have described it and that is what it is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was not my intention to intervene on the amendment, particularly not in relation to the Road Haulage Wages Act, which the Government seek to remove from the statute book. That was partly because my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) indicated from the outset that he wished to cover that area. I am sure that the Committee will accept that I do not seek to flatter my hon. Friend, but when he undertakes to cover an area he does it so efficiently and well that it is superfluous to comment further on amendments that he has moved. I mean that sincerely. He has established a good record in this Committee of putting forward many telling arguments and making telling points.<br><br>
I wonder whether the Government even know what they are doing in their proposal to remove this legislation from the statute book, particularly in relation to the EEC. For two years, I was the chairman of the Transport Committee of the European Parliament. One of the problems that occupied our minds during my tenure of that office concerned the transport regale-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1392">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1657</span>
tions that caused so many problems in this country last winter. Indeed, much of the winter of discontent was created by the lorry drivers reacting to the EEC legislation which sought to standardise the driving hours and conditions of lorry drivers, not simply in the United Kingdom but throughout the EEC.<br><br>
I suspect that the motive behind the proposal to remove the Road Haulage Wages Act, 1938 is some mythical introduction of competition. But that flies in the face of what the EEC has been trying to do since 1969, namely, seeking to remove all competition from the road haulage industry. Indeed, it is a matter of considerable importance to the EEC.<br><br>
The EEC insisted that the United Kingdom—after two derogations from the 1969 EEC regulations—bring into force the provisions of the 1969 regulations. The policy adopted throughout the EEC is that it issues quotas to any foreign hauliers seeking to operate in a different country. Those foreign hauliers are strictly licensed. I am sure that the Minister for Transport will confirm that. I wonder why this matter was not dealt with in the Transport Bill. It is a large Bill, which deals with every aspect of transport, yet it does not deal with this issue. I wonder why it has been slipped in here. I suspect that it has been tagged in with the repeal of sections 11 to 16 of the 1975 Act.<br><br>
Will the Secretary of State look again—even at this late stage—at the proposal to remove the road haulage provisions, in the light of our amendment No. 182? Will he check what I have said this afternoon that he is flying in the face—probably unwittingly—of what the EEC has been trying to do ever since 1969?<br><br>
I shall finish on a political note. One of the things to come out of the winter of discontent was the recognition by lorry drivers of their own strength and the damage that they can do the economy. As my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham said, if this is removed, it will certainly not bring peace and harmony to the industry. That, after all, is the intention of both this legislation and the EEC legislation, as well as removing the sort of competition which my hon. Friend described.<br><br>
Will the Secretary of State consider the Road Haulage Wages Act in the light of the EEC regulations, which are not quite fully in force in this country? Indeed, I believe that they will not come fully into
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1658</span>
force until 1 January 1981. In the light of our submissions, he may want to reconsider the matter, and come back to it on Report. Of course, he may reject our arguments and he may still seek to introduce an element of competition, because that is what all this is about.<br><br>
If the Secretary of State is seeking to introduce competition into the road haulage industry by this method, he is flying in the face of what the EEC has attempted to do since 1969. I suggest that he queries it with the EEC Commissioner responsible for transport.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Needham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like briefly to bring to the Committee's attention the problems faced by the construction industry in particular. It is perhaps unfortunate that representations are not made to the industry until late in the proceedings. It is therefore difficult to elicit views and put them before the Committee when it is left literally until the day the matter comes up for discussion. I say that particularly because the director of the National Federation of Building Trades Employers, Mr. Ian Deslandes, was the Conservative candidate at Pontefract before me.<br><br>
I raise this matter because there are the views of the unions as well as of the employers to be taken into account. Therefore, it is only right that my right hon. Friend and my hon. and learned Friend consider most carefully any representations made on behalf of both sides of the industry. This has also been mentioned by Opposition hon. Members.<br><br>
There is concern over the removal of the first leg of schedule 11 that is, the recognised terms and conditions, which in the construction industry at least have been in practice for 50 years. The industry will have six main concerns if the recognised terms and conditions disappear: first, the decasualisation of the industry; secondly, the training provisions within the industry in general; thirdly, health and safety; fourthly, apprenticeships provisions; fifthly, holiday pay and death benefit; sixthly, the authority of established industrial relations procedures.<br><br>
The construction industry, as many hon. Members will have realised through the representations of the federation, relies largely on people coming and going. Of a total labour force of 80,000, only 30,000 are federated. Therefore, it is most important that the national agreements and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1393">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1659</span>
bases on which the conditions are worked out are kept to by the industry. Otherwise—we all know that this can be true in the construction industry—the wide boys or the cowboys can take advantage of reasonable and respectable companies, to undercut them in contracts, and it makes it difficult to maintain decent conditions of work.<br><br>
It is only right to say that schedule 11 does not necessarily deal only with the recognised terms and conditions; it deals also with pay. To have this long-stop of sickness, disablement, travel-to-work provisions, holiday entitlement, severance pay, overtime shift allowances, apprenticeship schemes and general dispute procedures, where there is agreement at a national level, proves the general industrial relations provisions in the industry.<br><br>
I understand and accept entirely the arguments for the repeal of the general conditions, which have not in any event been enforced for many years. I know that we have also received fairly strong opposition from Courtaulds and other such companies—from Ford and so on. I understand the view that Ford has and its worries that, if companies are trapped into having to abide by the 39-hour week provisions of the Engineering Employers Federation, life for those companies will become extremely difficult, particularly when companies such as Ford are paying considerably in excess of the basic terms and conditions.<br><br>
May I point out to my right hon. Friend especially that there is allowance for that in paragraph 9 of schedule 11 of the 1975 Act, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In ascertaining whether, in respect of any matter which is the subject of a claim under paragraph 1 above, the employer is observing terms and conditions less favourable than the recognised terms and conditions, or as the case may be, the general level of terms and conditions regard shall be had to the whole of the terms and conditions observed by the employer as respects the worker to whom the claim relates.".</p></blockquote>
The CAC might not have taken this point on board as widely as it ought to have done—in particular, in those instances where employers are maintaining better than average general conditions. If that is so, the words in paragraph 9 could be changed. In place of the words
<br><blockquote><p>"regard shall be had to the whole"</p></blockquote>
why not insert words such as "full account must be taken" or "regard must be taken"?
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1660</span>
If that is the problem, surely that could be strengthened.<br><br>
I ask my right hon. Friend to consider that matter seriously. I recognise that it is difficult to do so today. There have been some very late representations, and it may be too much to ask him to consider the matter, or change his mind, now. But I ask him to consider the matter further.<br><br>
5.15 p.m.<br><br>
I appreciate that it is not desirable to alter the law to make provision for a particular case. But the matter goes wider than that. There are real grounds for concern—in particular, in the construction and furniture industries—over what will happen if the first leg is removed. I ask, therefore, that these points be taken into account.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends the Members for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) and Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) have produced some extremely well-argued reasons why the Government are taking entirely the wrong line on this matter. I do not wish to embarrass the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) when I say that he has shown himself to be not only on the side of righteousness, but on the side of decency and common sense.<br><br>
I had intended to refer to one point only. But I am tempted to point out that in all the lists of impressive bodies to which my hon. Friend the Member for Islington referred in support of our view on the matter he did not mention the Royal College of Nursing. That body
<br><blockquote><p>"considers that Schedule 11 of the 1975 EPA …gives invaluable protection to employees not covered by adequate bargaining machinery and strongly OPPOSES its repeal".</p></blockquote>
I wish to put that on record, given the circumstances which the Committee is meeting.<br><br>
I must press the hon. and learned Gentleman on one particular point, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, Central has also referred. It is how far the Government will conform to their international obligations if they proceed with the repeal of schedule 11 and The Road Haulage Wages Act 1938. The February 1980 issue of the journal of the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education comments that
<br><blockquote><p>"the Government is also in breach of international employment law.</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1394">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1661</span>
<br><blockquote><p>Britain is a signatory to a convention of the International Labour Office contained in ILO Recommendation No. 119. This requires that <i>all</i> terminations of employment are to be justifiable with respect to the factors there outlined. No provision is made by the Recommendation for the change in our law already made by variation order (S.I. 1979 No. 159) concerning the exemption for a year of an employer from unfair dismissal requirements."</p></blockquote>
I now come to the point that was touched upon by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, Central. The journal continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"Further, the UK has ratified ILO Convention 94, which contains clauses broadly similar to those of Schedule 11 of the EPA in the case of public contracts. Although the UK Fair Wages Resolu- tion of 1946 remains in force, it refers only to Government contracts, and while observed in most contracts with local authorities and nationa- lised industries, its terms do not legally so extend. Therefore, by repealing Schedule 11 of the EPA, Government employees remain specifically covered under the Fair Wages Resolution, but other public employees—i.e. those who are covered by the ILO Convention—do not. Since such cover is discretionary on local authorities, given public expenditure restraint,"</p></blockquote>
—this was written in February, and has been given added point by what was inflicted on the House and the country yesterday—
<br><blockquote><p>"it is possible only gloomily to observe that the discretion may well not be operated. The Govern- ment's working paper shows that it was aware of the ILO Convention, stating that 'it may be' that proposed changes would 'meet the Convention's essential principles'."</p></blockquote>
It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is hard to see how total repeal of Schedule 11 fulfils this hope."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Under-Secretary of State will reply to this point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: thank the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) for the way in which he moved the amendment. I hope that he will survive that injection of arsenic at the bedside, and I assure him that the intention is to sedate him only.<br><br>
This group of amendments focuses on difficult problems. As the working paper, which was published last summer, indi- cated, there is more than one attractive solution. I do not propose to address the Committee on the basis that, so far as these amendments are concerned, every- thing is all black or all white, or that there is a simple solution, because no alternative proposals can carry any weight. I believe it is more difficult.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1662</span>
We are discussing whether there should continue to be a procedure whereby an employee can complain to ACAS that his pay or his terms and conditions of employment are not appropriate. It is a procedure whereby, if that claim is not settled by negotiation and conciliation through ACAS, it should be referred to the Central Arbitration Committee and an award should be made following a formal hearing.<br><br>
No such procedure can be applied without incorporating some reference or benchmark for the purpose of comparison. Schedule 11 provides two, the first of which is recognised terms and conditions under national or district arrangements and agreements. The second is the general level observed by other employers in the same industry and the same district. As the hon. Member for Rotherham has rightly said, provisions of this nature have a long history in this country, but that factor alone is not decisive of the issues before the Committee.<br><br>
In Plantaganet times, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, and in more recent times, if one belonged to, or tried to set up, something of the nature of a trade union one went inside and probably did not come out, because it was a criminal conspiracy. It remained so until the enlightened Conservative Government of 1875 passed an Act which took it out of the criminal law. Consequently, the Minister responsible received a telegram of congratulation from the newly-formed TUC. It is the last telegram of congratulation from the TUC, but we live in hope!<br><br>
It must be borne in mind that there were no trades unions then, and there were substantial sanctions for trying to form one. Moreover, one must realise the vastly increased strength of collective bargaining. It is not enough to point to the long history—attractive though that always is as an argument to any Conservative. One must consider whether, despite the objectives that those arrangements were designed to serve and that schedule 11 today is designed to serve—the honourable and proper objectives of helping people whose pay is much less than that of others in similar circumstances—those arrangements are doing harm as well as good. If they are doing harm, we must balance the good against the bad. That is the spirit in which the Government approach this difficult subject.<br><br>
Those who support the continuance of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1395">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1663</span>
the arrangements in schedule 11 have those honourable motives. They want to help those whose pay is lower than that of most other people in the same class of work. I am quite certain of that. So do we all. The difference between us is whether we consider that we should rely upon mechanistic solutions, and put our faith in procedures, or that we should, more wisely, put our faith in creating the climate and the conditions in which there is a strong market for labour and in which high wages can be obtained through that means and through market forces.<br><br>
I well understand that there are those who would say, "It must be a mixture of both." But anyone who pays attention to the argument will agree that one must consider whether the mechanistic answer—the procedural answer—is actually doing the job. Why was the procedure invented? It was invented—and certainly it was given its most recent statutory form in 1975 by the late Government—in order to root out pockets of low pay. We must agree that it has not done that. The TUC would not contend that it has, and nor, I think, would the hon. Member for Islington, Central. On the other hand, it has substantially increased the pay of people who by no stretch of the imagination could be called low-paid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said quite the contrary. I produced the evidence in black and white and all the figures that the Warwick university unit has just produced. I did not read out all the figures, but I shall happily do so if the hon. and learned Gentleman want me to do so. He must have seen the same figures. They show precisely the opposite to what he is now suggesting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, the figures do not show precisely the opposite. According to Warwick university's research, the low-paid have predominated among those who have benefited from schedule 11. I would not argue to the contrary. But what I shall argue in a moment is that substantial numbers of people have also been benefited by this statutory procedure who could not by any stretch of the imagination have been called low-paid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what the hon. and learned Gentleman said before.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1664</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is exactly what I was saying before. The difficulty of getting one's message over is that if one gives way one tends to be deflected.<br><br>
We all share the same objective. If there were some great crock of gold that never had to be replenished, into which one had only to dip in order to bring up the wages of the low-paid, we would all be glad to make use of it. but there is no such crock of gold. The question has to be, therefore, first, whether this statutory procedure helps the low-paid and, secondly, whether it causes too much harm elsewhere—if indeed it causes any harm elsewhere.<br><br>
Plainly, the procedure has helped some of the low-paid, at least in the short term. I do not think that there can be any doubt about that. The IRC research at Warwick is interesting, and I am perfectly prepared to accept that low-paid people have benefited, probably in substantial numbers. I suspect, however, that when IRC publishes its research it will wish to acknowledge that the base of the sample—all schedule 11 awards in 1978 for which sufficient and reliable data were available—leaves a fair amount to be desired. In effect, it means awards where the distribution of claimants among different pay scales was made clear.<br><br>
5.30 p.m.<br><br>
Awards in this category cover only 45 per cent. of all employees involved in schedule 11 awards in 1978. The nature of the sample means that it is likely that awards relating to groups with complex pay structures will be excluded, including some higher paid groups such as the BBC and industrial training boards. None the less I acknowledge that probably a substantial number of low paid people have benefited.<br><br>
However, if the schedule has helped some low paid people, certainly it has not got rid of pockets of low paid people and it has also helped large numbers of those who cannot be described in any way as being on the books of the Low Pay Unit.<br><br>
As invited by the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant), I leave out of account the pay policy argument. We all agree that schedule 11 was used as a means of getting round a statutory pay policy. We do not have a statutory pay policy and I trust that we will not have one again. Therefore I leave that argument out of account.<br><br>
However, although there is no statutory
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1396">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1665</span>
pay policy in force, today there is just as wide a capability for managerial employees and the higher paid to use the procedure of schedule 11 as there was at the height of the statutory pay policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not need it now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very well. The hon. Gentleman might advance that argument to the 26,000 employees of the BBC who secured something like a 16 per cent pay increase across the board. It was 12 per cent with up to 4 per cent on top. That was the result of their claim at Christmas 1978 under schedule 11. Today they have another claim pending before the CAC.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that they do not need it because all the resources of collective bargaining are available to them. But that does not prevent them from making use of the statutory procedure. The hon. Gentleman exactly pinpoints what lies behind the Government's policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying hard to think back to the detail of the BBC pay increase. I believe that the BBC wished to pay that money anyhow. The corporation was prevented from so doing by the Government pay policy in the public sector. Had that pay policy not existed the case would not have gone through the schedule 11 procedure. The payment would have been made because the employer wanted to make it.<br><br>
I believe that most of the pay settlements arising from schedule 11 <i>in</i> its application to higher paid groups of staff have been of that kind—in which the employer would have paid anyhow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman says that the employer would have paid anyhow, but that is not my understanding of that dispute. The BBC was confronted with a pay claim shortly before Christmas 1978 for about 26,000 BBC employees, including senior managerial, production and editorial staff. It would be hard to categorise those as the low paid. The award was finalised in March 1979, but I believe that an interim award was made in a couple of days. That was before Christmas. That award was made right across the board under this statutory procedure.<br><br>
In January 1980 the paper and paper products industrial training board had an award made for all grades from clerk and typist up to senior training advisers
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1666</span>
and managers. Other industrial training boards had similar awards made for advisory and material employees.<br><br>
The Staffordshire county council faced a claim on behalf of the county trading standards officer and his deputy, who were gentlemen earning between £10,300 and £11,100 a year. There are other claims, either current or already made, not necessarily successfully, for people such as Press Association journalists, Albright and Wilson's chemical engineers and white collar groups—for example, administrative, technical, research, engineering staff and foremen, including senior grades in these categories.<br><br>
That which originated, as the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) said, in arrangements solely for the benefit of the low paid, has now escalated into a structure which can be employed by those at any grade or salary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say anything of the sort. At no stage did I suggest that the provisions of schedule 11, the Road Haulage Wages Act or the terms and conditions of employment legislation were of particular benefit to the low paid. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, Central (Mr Grant) dwelt at some length on the benefits that the low paid had gained but I certainly did not.<br><br>
I should not care to argue along those lines because I am in favour of a system that provides order in pay negotiations and helps to avoid strikes and other forms of industrial action—whether for highly-, middle- or low-paid. I believe that the principle is the same. In respect of what the hon. and learned Gentleman said about my reference to Plantagenet days, the first to benefit from the concept of fair wages were very early craftsmen. They were by no means low paid but they benefited from the fair wages concept.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree with that and I am sorry if I misrepresented the hon. Gentleman. He is absolutely right that the early arrangements were in respect of craftsmen. He made his case more logical by saying that he justified schedule 11 in terms of order and as a safety valve.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr Grant) fastened on the position of the low paid and picked up a point made by the Camden community council. After all, low pay is regarded by most people as being the root of the justification for any
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1397">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1667</span>
measure such as schedule 11. I believe that the Low Pay Unit and similar bodies must acknowledge that, in addition to some low-paid people having benefited, plenty of others who are comparatively well-heeled have hitched a hefty lift in pay. Do we wish that to continue? The question is often asked: what harm is there in that?<br><br>
If it is not we who have to pay, it is tempting to reply, "There is no harm in it. Jolly good luck to them. That order is very desirable and a premium should be put on it." I understand that view but I do not share it, for reasons that I shall develop.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. and learned Gentleman suggesting that we should substitute disorder for order? In all the instances that he has outlined there was no industrial unrest or strikes. Does he propose that we should scrap all the provisions and return to the law of the jungle, where industrial muscle will count and people will be able to grab what they want? If so, that flies in the face of everything else that he has said about the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have suggested that we should look very carefully to see whether order should not be replaced by that precept which the right hon. Gentleman told us lay at the root of good industrial relations—namely, that of collective bargaining. If anything is in conflict with that precept it is the statutory procedure. One cannot possibly describe compulsory unilateral arbitration as a bargain. That is my answer to the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
The Committee and the House of Commons must decide whether we believe that industrial relations should depend on collective bargaining, which I had always understood to be common ground—certainly it was argued today by the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker), or whether we put so much faith in order that we look for imposed solutions. I thought that it was our experience and common ground that imposed solutions did harm on the whole.<br><br>
I should like to develop that point in a moment. We have been told by the Low Pay Unit that there is no evidence of harm to industrial relations by this procedure. We have certainly to look for evidence, perhaps rather more widely than the Low Pay Unit has been able to look, if we seek to repeal something with a long history of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1668</span>
these procedures. The Low Pay Unit argues that the charge of a deleterious effect on industrial relations is completely unfounded, but I would refer the Committee to the Chrysler claim last year.<br><br>
The broad facts are that a claim was made on behalf of 28 telephonists and senior telephonists. The company argued that any award for these employees would have adverse repercussions throughout its salary structure because employees in 12 other occupations but in the same grade were paid the same rates of pay.<br><br>
The CAC explained that it was conscious of the fact that by making an award in this case it would be creating considerable difficulties for the company and possible for the union as well. However, it was bound by the schedule to base its awards solely on the evidence presented to it. In the circumstances the CAC did not believe it would be justified in taking account of wider industrial relations considerations and proceeded to award an increase of 5 per cent. to the telephonists.<br><br>
That is an illustration of the harm that can be done. It is very difficult when pressed to give evidence to decide what sort of evidence would meet the exacting standards of right hon. and hon. Gentlemen because l would have thought that this one was slap on the ball. It may be unwelcome but it is slap on the point. Again, the BBC claim seems to illustrate the harm that can be done. I am addressing myself to the question of what harm there is in it. Its foundation was that the relevant grades would be paid more if they worked for ITV. ITV was paying more, it was a claim brought under the general level and that was all there was to it. A temporary short-term imbalance, as Sir John Wood, the chairman of the CAC, described it, could have been put right at the next time for collective bargaining.<br><br>
But what happened? It was approaching Christmas Eve, the snow lay think in Downing Street and so did the hypocrisy. The consequence was that rather than have excellent television entertainment denied to the British people, the CAC procedure was employed and the result was as I have described. The Corporation, being dependent on licence revenue, was. by virtue of this procedure compelled to pay—before the time for the next round and back-dated to the date of the last annual increase—these substantial increases, not because claims were outside the scope of collective bargaining but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1398">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1669</span>
because they were within the scope of collective bargaining and there existed a mechanism, a procedure, whereby blackmail of that type at Christmas could be bought off by compulsion. It was bought off by compulsion because compulsory unilateral arbitration was available and was imposed. As I understand matters, it now faces another claim for the same employees.<br><br>
I ask by what principle that can be justified for 26,000 employees, virtually the whole of the payroll of the BBC, right across the board to senior management level. Having asked the question I suppose that I must listen to the answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has ignored completely what I earlier said about this case. My recollection of the circumstances at the time is that the BBC was arguing to its staff that it would pay the money were it not for the Government's pay policy, which it said was the only obstacle.<br><br>
5.45 p.m.<br><br>
In the light of what I have said, to attribute to scedule 11 all the awful things described by the hon and learned Gentleman is to mislead the Committee. If the BBC said at the time that it would have paid the money if it had not been for Government pay policy, all those things would have ensued anyhow. Schedule 11 merely happened to be available as a device whereby the employer who would have paid out anyhow could connive with the union to exploit its provisions.<br><br>
That is not to say that the schedule itself is responsible for all the bad consequences. Had the employer been able to pay up, the consequences would have been the same even without the schedule, whether BBC staff or anyone else had been involved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I add to that? The hon. and learned Gentleman invited an answer. Having told us that he did not intend to go along the pay policy road, and use that as a reason, he seems to have spent a great deal of time doing exactly that. I agree with what my right hon. Friend has said about the BBC claim.<br><br>
However, even if the hon. and learned Gentleman had been right in his interpretation it sits uneasily upon his shoulders to talk about hypocrisy in such matters. The present Government's covert pay
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1670</span>
policy allows those in the public sector with industrial muscle to settle at a high level but screws down those without industrial muscle. The hon. and learned Gentleman really ought not to be talking about hypocrisy. If he wants a general debate on pay policy I am sure that we could engineer one within the framework of the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be glad to debate pay policy at any time when it would be in order. However, although it is right to say that, faced with that procedure and knowing what lay at the end of it, the BBC supported the claim in the CAC, it is much more open to doubt whether without that statutory stick the BBC would in any event have conceded a claim of 16 per cent. through collective bargaining.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What did it say to the staff association at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know. However, although there is now no statutory pay policy, schedule 11 remains in full force. No doubt that is much to the pleasure and satisfaction of 26,000 of the BBC's employees, who are now preparing, indeed are already prosecuting, a further claim.<br><br>
I hoped that I would get an answer to my question. I asked by what principle or precept that could be justified. Certainly it cannot be justified by the precepts of collective bargaining. If employees were to put their faith in the collective bargaining that has now been restored to them by a beneficent Government they would have no need to make use of schedule II. [<i>Interruption</i>]. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can give me the answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some of us have never accepted that free collective bargaining over wages was the answer to everyone's problems. Free collective bargaining produced highly paid workers at one end of the scale and low-paid workers—such as those in the hospital service—at the other. If and when the Prime Minister introduces a pay policy, as she almost certainly will within the next few months, will the Government reintroduce schedule 11 and the Road Haulage Wages Act?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is rather like a flat earther asking a traveller what he will do when he falls off the end of the world, as he almost certainly will. [<i>Interruption.</i>]

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1671</span>
I can think of no one with whom I would rather fall off the end of the world than the hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Lyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise that I had to be out of the room—for an excellent reason, whom I see sitting not too far away. I have been listening to the cause of the physiotherapists recently.<br><br>
I have had a close association with this matter recently. The BBC got its large pay rise at Christmas. I think the Under-Secretary has mentioned that the ITV people then had a great strike last summer and managed to raise their rates of pay. Now the BBC people are engaged in that so-called free collective bargaining again; they all went on a long strike to get the pay up. The leapfrog is re-flogging.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Enterprise and initiative.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, enterprise and initiative, as they say in Tower Hamlets. But is my hon. Friend aware that the independent radio unions are in on this act too? They have been arguing that their members, who work all over the country from Newcastle to Swansea, should all be equated with the 26,000 employees of the BBC across the whole band from publishers to producers, in order to take advantage of this beneficent piece of legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend exactly points—[<i>Interruption.</i>] There is too much interference at the moment, Mr. Goodhew. The wavelengths are very crowded. My hon. Friend, with his experience of these matters, exactly points to the evil of this statutory procedure. That is what happens. Ever body gets in on the act. This is crock of gold stuff. It is fine if there is a crock of gold, but ultimately disastrous—not just to employers, but also to employees—if there is not.<br><br>
That is not a creation of the febrile imagination of a simple lawyer such as myself. It is the view of the industrial relations director of Courtaulds, one of our greatest firms—and a firm not noted for other than liberal employment policies. I referred briefly on Second Reading to the experience of Courtaulds at Carrick Fergus in Northern Ireland. This letter from the industrial relations director to my Department is of more recent date. I think it would be helpful if I read it.<br><br>
The director says:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1672</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"we in Courtaulds believe that total repeal of Schedule 11 forms an essential part of the basis for a successful structure of collective bargaining in the future".</p></blockquote>
He gives three reasons. If the hon. Gentleman replies, he may care to address himself to these reasons. The first is:
<br><blockquote><p>"The 'handing down' of wage awards from remote central bodies creates in employees' minds the vision of a bottomless pit of wealth, irrespective of the circumstances of their particular enterprise and totally at variance with the Government's philosophy based upon 'ability to pay'. No amount of explanation of the economic facts of life can stand up against the background of an apparent source of cash unrelated to the workplace circumstances."</p></blockquote>
The second is:
<br><blockquote><p>"Because substantial pay increases can be achieved through the easy route of (i) above, it becomes extremely difficult to carry out effective bargaining on a productivity basis within individual companies or workplaces: instead of the exchange of commitments, which is an essential element in true bargaining, we have a virtual one-way traffic in increased pay."</p></blockquote>
The third is:
<br><blockquote><p>"the availability of unilateral compulsory arbitration, to spread the effect of central negotiations across entire sectors of industry, provides trade unions with a power-base without a balancing obligation to staff and equip themselves adequately. Sound industrial relations machinery will never develop if the framework provides unions gratuitously with power unmatched by responsibility."</p></blockquote>
I ask only that those considerations be taken seriously by hon. Gentlemen who support these amendments. They are matched in part by the support by Ford for the repeal of schedule 11 because Ford fears that in its case it will be matched by a demand for a 39-hour week. That company pays much higher than the rates. One can see how this can be applied right across the board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Needham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend referred to the letter from Courtaulds. One understands its position in the industry, but it would be interesting to know whether the industry as a whole goes along with Courtaulds and whether they abide by what was said in the letter. Two of the three points in the Courtaulds letter deal entirely with wages. Naturally we accept the difficulties that my hon. and learned Friend has mentioned, but does he not agree that there are areas of tremendous importance other than wages that can be covered by national agreements? Does not he also agree that the majority of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1400">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1673</span>
national agreements, even relating to pay, are lower than most companies pay?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. There are arrangements and conditions relating to holiday pay, insurance and such things that are quite separate from pay which are covered by these arrangements. But I believe it is better in the long run, in everyone's interests, that these matters are negotiated, not imposed. When they are imposed, and without regard to the individual circumstances of productivity, and profitability, for example, as was the case in the Carrick Fergus works of Courtaulds, under the equivalent Northern Ireland provision, there are distortions and they led, in Courtaulds' case, I am told, to the closing down of one unit in its group. That is the difficulty that confronts us. I fear that I am in danger of taking too long.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am asking a serious question here. The hon. and learned Gentleman referred to the situation in Carrick Fergus and the CAC award, and not taking into account profitability and so on. Is he sure of that? That conflicts with the general view that in such circumstances the CAC does take these things into account. I know that the Government have not accepted that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall take a little more time to sustain that. The manual workers union at Carrick Fergus, having taken part in normal collective bargaining, has proceeded in the last two years to submit claims to the industrial court of Northern Ireland under schedule 3, general level provision, citing five other fibre producers in the Province for comparison. None of these companies operates the same type of productivity-based pay structure, and all of them form part of larger organisations operating, unlike Courtaulds, primarily within the chemicals industry, from which they can draw support in bad times.<br><br>
Courtaulds advanced weighty arguments to the industrial court that the other companies cited by the unions were not all in the same district, their work people were not truly comparable, and the circumstances of those companies were not similar; hence no general level could rightly be established in the circumstances. The industrial court awarded pay increases to bring the earnings into line with those of the other companies, notwithstanding the radical differences in the basis of wage
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1674</span>
determination and in the general circumstances of the company.<br><br>
Earlier, the Court said that the long-established agreements with the trade unions representing manual workers commit both parties to base pay concessions upon improved efficiency, and state that productivity bargaining at plant level should be the primary source of wage increases, regard being paid to economic considerations relevant to the viability of the particular unit. This is crucial, they say, in the present state of the textile industry.<br><br>
They say that the unions were provided with a route to obtain increased pay which circumvented the conditions in their own agreements with the company, and efforts to conduct responsible collective bargaining based upon the meaningful exchange of commitments have been frustrated. In effect, the viability of the plant has been put out of consideration in determining wage levels.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Who is that quotation from?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a statement of a case for repeal that has been communicated to my Department, by letter to a Member of Parliament, from Courtaulds, Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That proves nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am asked to provide evidence to support repeal. I am asked to provide evidence of damage which the existing procedures are causing. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I do not have the slightest difficulty in dealing with this. It is provided by Courtaulds at Carrick Fergus to the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, my hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey (Mr. Shaw). That is the statement of the case for appeal set out by the company. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I do not know whether I could give more particular chapter and verse than that, or than the letter I have read from the industrial relations director. I appreciate that it is unpalatable, but the Government have to take these matters into account. One must look at the position in the round.</span></p>
<p>6.0 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must press the hon. and learned Gentleman. The question I asked was simply this. Can he substantiate the suggestion that the CAC had not taken
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1401">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1675</span>
this matter of profitability, and so on, into account? The Under-Secretary has read us a long dissertation from Courtaulds, but he has not done anything to answer the question. He has given Courtaulds opinion and nothing else. By the sound of it he did not even know what he was reading.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The CAC can give weight to ability to pay only by setting aside, to some extent, its obligation to award in line with recognised terms or general level. There is no profitability criterion or any reference to profit in the schedule. That is a statement of fact.<br><br>
I wish to finish with this comment. Of course there is much to be said—my hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) has said it as eloquently as anyone could—on the advantage side, particularly for certain industries where there is a high turnover of the labour force and where, possibly, there is not a high level of organisation. But it is mainly said, it is interesting to note, by employers' associations. It is not said to any great extent by individual employers.<br><br>
I can understand why an employers' federation or association would want to ensure that the members of the federation did not face competition from those who did not subscribe to terms and conditions which the federation had negotiated. It is perfectly right that there should be associations, and I am in favour of their being strong. But I am not so much in favour of their being strong as to lead me to support statutory provisions which enable people to have their wages hoisted up as a result of negotiations entered into by different people who do not represent them. That is wrong in principle.<br><br>
The builders argue that without the protection of the first leg of schedule 11 their national agreements would be less effectively applied. They say that this could threaten adherence by smaller employers to national rules on such matters as health and safety, holiday pay and death benefits, as well as pay and hours.<br><br>
Of course one must treat the industry with respect. But it is inherently speculative. The industry is not noted for its industrial discipline and the observance of agreements. It is accepted by employers and unions that there are a substantial number of firms in the building industry that do not follow the detailed provisions of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1676</span>
national agreements. But I do not believe that schedule 11 has ever been used to oblige an employer to take part in the holiday pay or death benefit schemes that have been negotiated by any federation or employers' association. I suspect that schedule 11 has only a marginal effect on the extent of compliance with these other conditions of national agreements.<br><br>
I believe that the advantages—I concede that there are some—are outweighed by the objections. They are outweighed by the objections set out in the working paper; by the inflationary and damaging effect of the general level provisions, with the ultimate damaging effect on jobs and employment prospects; by the damage to the concept of collective bargaining; by the inherent wrongness of the notion of unilateral compulsory arbitration, having an agreement made nationally between people who represent neither worker nor employer, precluding one from bargaining one's own arrangements and having the bargain stick.<br><br>
I hope that I have covered the points raised. My right hon. Friend will no doubt deal with the points about the EEC and the ILO, rather than my protracting an already lengthy speech. I have sought to indicate why the Government believe that schedule 11 should be repealed in its entirety.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to take part in this discussion until I listened to the Under-Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Provocation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.<br><br>
In 31 Sittings of the Committee we have come to have a great deal of respect for the Under-Secretary of State for Employment. He is usually extremely persuasive, but when he is on thin ice he waffles and hesitates. This happened in the previous debate as well as on this amendment. He has come nowhere near answering the case put by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, Central (Mr Grant) nor the case of the Low Pay Unit or Warwick University. Both those organisations have provided overwhelming evidence that schedule 11 has helped the low-paid.<br><br>
However, the hon. Gentleman does not want to deal with that, and we get the flannel and waffle about the BBC and something about Courtaulds. It is irrelevant to use the case of the BBC, because
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1402">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1677</span>
when the last Government were embarking on the voluntary pay policy we specifically excluded schedule 11. It was part of our intention to do so. The hon. Gentleman referred to it, with a slip of the tongue, as a statutory policy, but it was not. For cases such as these there must be exclusions, but when it comes to Courtaulds, I am not prepared to take the evidence of one unnamed industrial relations director in Northern Ireland, of all places, that this has in some way damaged its business, and at the same time brush aside, as the Under-Secretary did, other evidence come from the Engineering Employers Federation, the Institute of Directors and other bodies that want to retain this.<br><br>
When it comes to assistance from the Government or legislation to help, Courtaulds is quite happy to take things like regional assistance when the Government devise accelerated project schemes or investment grants, which in some cases can affect the market. I do not blame Courtaulds for taking assistance of that kind if it will promote jobs, but when it comes to something which is likely to help some of its employees, the firm wants it brushed aside.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's arguments are erroneous. Part of our argument is that schedule 11 brings some order into the wages market. There is nothing wrong with this and I should imagine that the hon. and learned Gentleman, with his legal background, is in favour of some order. I do not deal often with barristers but occasionally I have to go to solicitors where the most terrible arrangements exist—there seems to be little competition on scales of charges. For convincing done by a solicitor the charge is the same whichever solicitor is consulted; no doubt this exists in other areas of the legal profession.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not at the Bar.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, not at the Bar. I suppose it depends on status.<br><br>
This relatively new legislation gives trade unionists new rights and opportunities and if there are some minor defects the Government's attitude is, " Wipe it all out—get rid of it completely. " That is what they are doing now and have done on other occasions.<br><br>
The Government will get into terrible trouble on this matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, Central referred to muscle. Of course they much prefer that in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1678</span>
some industrial disputes. For example, in the public service sector there is no international competition, unlike the public trading sector. The private sector will be squeezed hard because of the harsh economic conditions and sombre background. There will be major discrepancies and the Government will not be able to do anything about them.<br><br>
In any event, they go along with comparability in some areas. There is no suggestion the Government want to do away with the reviews in the Civil Service, for example. I hasten to add that I do not want to either. But matters are very selective. The Government ignore the overwhelming evidence from the studies of help for the low paid. They bring forward an obscure case from Northern Ireland about a factory there and try to convince the Committee that there should be complete abolition.<br><br>
The Opposition believe that there should be a mechanism for dealing with the matter. It is wholly in keeping with the Government's philosophy that if there is something wrong—a minor defect, for instance—instead of trying to rectify it they want to eliminate the legislation completely. The Opposition will vote for our amendment with enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. James Prior)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary asked me to deal with one or two points that have arisen. I shall try to do that briefly. The criticisms of schedule 11 apply with even more force to the Road Haulage Wages Act. It is hard to justify special provision for a group of employees who we believe are, on the whole, well protected by collective bargaining arrangements.<br><br>
That is borne out by the number of cases that have been brought under the Act in the past 20 years, which is only 21. In a number of instances those concerned a single employee. Although since 1978 there has been an increase in the number of claims, only one substantial award has been made, in respect of milk distribution. For that reason the Government feel that, as the same arguments applied to schedule 11 it would have made nonsense of our position not to have included it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the whole point, and shows the advantage of the Act. The major award concerned the milk industry, with a comparatively small number of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1403">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1679</span>
drivers involved by comparison with those in the hire and reward sector. We all recall graphically the nasty dispute in the hire and reward sector. Is it not better for machinery to exist under which the CAC can settle a claim affecting a comparatively small number of people by reference to what has become an agreement negotiated through collective bargaining in the much larger sector of the industry than to go through the whole nasty process again? Can the Committee imagine the disastrous effect on the whole country if the dispute had applied to the milk industry, with not a single pint of, milk being delivered for six or seven weeks? That would have been appalling. If anything is needed to show the value of the Road Haulage Wages Act, that is a classic example.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman has made a general point that I shall take up later. But I should like to deal with a further issue that was raised concerning EEC regulations on drivers' hours, which are being implemented in stages. Regulations will also be needed to accompany the introduction of the tachographs which now seems to have been accepted in principle by both sides of the industry.<br><br>
However, those matters do not need to be enforced through a mechanism such as schedule 11 or the 1938 Act. Enforcement provisions are included in the regulations. Furthermore, the 1938 Act relates only to remuneration; it does not cover drivers' hours or other terms and conditions of employment. To that extent, it is even less satisfactory than schedule 11.<br><br>
6.15 p.m.<br><br>
I did not really intend to speak tonight. I have listened to the whole debate and to what my hon. and learned Friend said in summing up. The decision on recognised terms and conditions is one of the most difficult and balanced that the Committee has to take in the whole of the Bill. The Government are worried about the inflationary aspects that can result from the operation of schedule 11. and the way in which the schedule can deny people with strong collective bargaining arrangements the right to make their own agreements. We have had one or two examples of that. It can prejudge bargains reached by both sides—perhaps there is a strong employer and equally strong trade union representation in the collective bargaining mach-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1680</span>
inery—by their following the recognised terms and conditions. That is what Ford has put to us, and it is a good example.<br><br>
Naturally, I have listened with care to what the building industry said, as outlined in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham (Mr Needham). I have also met both sides of the furniture industry. It is significant that in the engineering industry while the Engineering Employers Federation started off by saying that it wished the recognised terms and conditions to remain, as the weeks have passed since the Bill's publication we have heard much less about that.<br><br>
I believe that the federation is very divided about whether any part of schedule 11 should be kept. Many of its members have changed their minds in the past few months. They have not made any representations since the early days of the Bill. I believe that the same applies to the CBI, which also has tried to examine the argument from both sides.<br><br>
One matter that has influenced me is that most of industry at present is completely of the mind that we should abolish schedule 11 completely. Therefore we have not had many representations about the need for that, but only about the need to keep it. I believe that if it were suggested for one moment that we were to keep any part of schedule 11 we should be inundated with people saying that it should be got rid of.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand the right hon. Gentleman on that. The Government's consultative document gave three options—to keep it, to amend it or to abolish it. Why should he now say that he would have been inundated in such circumstances? Why did that not happen at the beginning?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was certainly inundated at the time of the consultative document. People got in touch with me to say, "Thank God you are doing it." That was the general view of industry. That has been the general view of industry.<br><br>
Therefore, if there was the slightest suspicion that I was in any way going to look at it again I would have had a lot more pressure put upon me in the last few weeks than we have been under. It is almost in just the last few days that we have come under some pressure from the British Furniture Manufacturers' Federated Associations and the building industry.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1404">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1681</span>
I believe that the motor dealers have also been in touch with us.<br><br>
I have to advise my hon. Friends that I was impressed by what the building industry had to say to me on the subject of its terms and conditions. I felt that it made out a case that its industrial relations were the better because of that. I must own that in that case I felt that the federation would continue in existence to provide the building industry with the right terms and conditions, particularly those referring to health and safety at work, the death grant, holidays, stamps and so on and I see no reason why those things should not continue.<br><br>
I suggest that my hon. Friends should reject the amendments. I further suggest in rejecting them and I say this in public so that we get the record absolutely clear—that if between now and further stages of the Bill people wish to make further representations to us in either one way or the other, we will consider those further. But I give no undertaking at all to the Committee. I believe that this is an important and sensitive matter and that it would be right for the Government to receive further considerations from industry on this, but I make absolutely plain that the Government's view at present is that the schedule should be abolished. I wish to maintain that position.<br><br>
Therefore, I recommend to my hon. Friends that we vote against the amendments when people can again make representations to us if they so wish. If they do so I promise the Committee to take another careful look at the matter between now and a later stage of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the right hon. Gentleman is concluding his speech, as he appears to be doing, I would remind him, as I reminded his hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary, that he still has not answered the point about the United Kingdom's international obligations. Perhaps, like his hon. and learned Friend, he, too, does not know the answer.<br><br>
I wish to take up what the right hon. Gentleman said about being prepared to receive further representations from industry. So far, like the rest of his hon. and hon. and learned Friends, he has assumed that industry is composed entirely of employers. At no stage has he given any indication that he is prepared to consider evidence from the trade unions and the workers' organisations.<br><br>

I ask whether the right hon. Gentleman is equally prepared, during the further consultative period that he appears to be opening up, to receive, pay regard to, have respect for and take full account of the representations made by those other people in industry—namely, those who work in it and the representatives of their organisations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman should know that, when I use the word "industry" I mean anyone in industry. I try to get away from saying "both sides of industry" and I hope that in years to come that will be an outdated concept. But, of course, I have already received some representations from trade unions, some from employers, and I suspect that after this I shall receive more representations.<br><br>
What is the good of receiving representations if one is not prepared to listen to them? Of course I shall listen to them but that does not necessarily mean that I shall agree with them. I want to make it absolutely plain at the moment, having weighed up this matter with extreme care and recognising that it is a finely balanced argument, that the Government's decision is that we should abolish schedule 11.<br><br>
Therefore, I will listen to further representations, from wherever they may come. Without giving any guarantee and trying on the whole to say, "No, this is the Government's decision "—this will have to be a collective decision by the Government—we could deal with this at a later stage of the Bill.<br><br>
I understand that there is no ILO convention requiring the United Kingdom to maintain a statutory mechanism such as schedule 11. Convention 94 refers to employees of Government contractors only and is currently given effect in the United Kingdom through the fair wages resolutions. I hope that answers the right hon. Gentleman's point. On the basis of the decision that we have reached I hope that my hon. Friends will vote against the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I missed most of the speech of the Secretary of State but I wish to make a few comments in reply to his hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary.<br><br>
It is surprising that during the debate on the Bill the hon. and learned Gentleman appears able to produce a letter from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1405">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1683</span>
someone. We had a letter from a headmaster when we discussed the clause on maternity leave, which was rather hilarious and did his case no good at all. The hon. and learned Gentleman has now produced another letter and seems to be under the impression that the receipt of one letter has created a volume of opinion in favour of the project he is advocating.<br><br>
It is unfortunate that the hon. and learned Gentleman chose a manufacturing industry in Northern Ireland where wage rates are at least £5, £6 or £7 a week lower than on the mainland. If people consider comparative wages, as does the CAC, they would compare wages in Courtaulds in Northern Ireland with those in Courtaulds in the Midlands or the North of England and not with surrounding industry. Therefore, the hon. and learned Gentleman chose a bad example to give to the Committee.<br><br>
If the clause is passed in its present form it will mean that for the first time in 40 years there will be no statutory provisions for the extension of recognised terms and conditions of employment throughout similar industries. One must bear in mind that 40 years ago in 1940, when this legislation arose out of Order No. 1 305, it was instituted and carried forward by successive Conservative Governments. It appeared again in the Terms and Conditions of Employment Act 1959 and the employers welcomed that.<br><br>
It should be pointed out that employers would welcome a provision to ensure that their labour rates are not being undercut because that is an aspect of unfair competition. Someone in the haulage industry paying standard or good wages is obviously keen to see that some cowboy does not come along with a cheap truck, paying cheap wages and undermining his position.<br><br>
Therefore, this legislation has proved beneficial to employers. The Road Haulage Wages Act goes back to 1938, again instituted by a Conservative Government. One has to look around with a magnifying glass to find reasons why the situation has suddenly changed. In 1959 when a Conservative Government were in power they took no steps whatever to alter the legislation. Indeed, in the Industrial Relations Act 1971 no mention whatever was made of these schedules.<br><br>
Suddenly, the Government have decided that the time is ripe to deprive trade unionists of facilities long held under
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1684</span>
previous Tory Governments. For example, that would include the facility in the Road Haulage Wages Act 1938 to take unilateral action for arbitration.<br><br>
6.30 p.m.<br><br>
Therefore, one can only conclude that this has been done because the Government are vindictive towards the trade union movement. For example, they are vindictive towards the transport workers who came out on strike last winter.<br><br>
One cannot understand the reasons that have been advanced for deleting this section of our legislation. One can understand that the Government, who have no pay policy, are interested in keeping down wage rates. They have said so. In spite of inflation being 20 per cent, they have warned the trade unions that if they ask for more than 14 per cent, they will ruin the country and will not be helping the Government to get inflation down.<br><br>
Therefore, when my hon. Friends say that the Government have no pay policy, that is not true. The policy is to keep pay increases well below the increase in the cost of living—in other words, to ask people to accept a reduction in their standard of living so as to solve the Government's self-created economic problems.<br><br>
As a consequence, one can only believe that their proposal that
<br><blockquote><p>"section 98 of and Schedule 11 to the 1975 Act"</p></blockquote>
should cease to have effect is one more weapon in their armoury to reduce wages. Allied to that, perhaps, is a bit of vindictiveness towards the trade unions.<br><br>
If the Government are trying to promote this they should give their reasons. For 40 years successive Acts have incorporated these provisions. Why are they now saying that it is working to the disadvantage of the Government? I presume it is to the disadvantage of the Government, because it is certainly not working to the disadvantage of the workers.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary admitted that there was no doubt that many low paid workers had benefited as a result of the legislation. In the first nine months of 1979 I believe that about 60 cases were considered by the CAC in the road haulage industry. Therefore, advantage is being taken of the Act. As a result, people are getting better wages—particularly lower paid people.<br><br>
No case has been made out by the Government for rejecting the amendment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1406">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1685</span>
and insisting that the clause should have effect. I therefore hope that, as the Secretary of State has hinted, the Government will start to think again about the matter and will decide that no good purpose would be served by continuing this provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the Under-Secretary talked about the telegram from the TUC to the Conservative Government at that time, I thought that he was living in hope that it might happen again, but that probably it was better for him to travel hopefully than to arrive.<br><br>
Now, having listened to the rest of the debate, I believe that that sums up my position—that, all along, it was better to travel hopefully than to have arrived and finally heard what the Secretary of State had to say, although I appreciated that he has left the door open. I shall return to that.<br><br>
Several points were made by the Under-Secretary that I should like to pick up. I shall not take over-long on them.<br><br>
One phrase stuck in my mind. I hope I have it right. He said that the best way to deal with the problems that we have been debating would be to create a strong market for labour and high wages. Perhaps one can leave aside the question of high wages. The Government are right to be worried about them in view of the rest of the economic difficulties that they are facing. However, to talk about creating a strong market for labour when we can see the kind of labour market that is developing and to relate it to this legislation was to make our case for not moving on this matter.<br><br>
I want to pick up the Under-Secretary again on profitability. I know that after he had been suitably guided, he came up with a form of words that suggested that the CAC does not take that into account. There seems to be a clash of evidence. I do not think that anyone has challenged the fact that the University of Warwick industrial relations research unit has done its job thoroughly although I suppose it could be wrong on this point. But the unit made it crystal clear that profitability came into the picture.<br><br>
The unit's paper states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Nor indeed does the Committee"—</p></blockquote>
the central arbitration committee—
<br><blockquote><p>"spurn the criterion of profitability. In deciding claims the CAC takes into account the pay and other conditions of employment prevailing in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1686</span>
companies in comparable economic situations. These form the range within which the general level is determined. To the extent that these companies consider their ability to pay and levels of profitability when settling rates of pay, CAC awards do reflect, albeit indirectly these economic criteria.".</p></blockquote>
So one can only say that there is a clash of evidence. But it is there in black and white. All we had from the Under-Secretary was a reference to a note that had clearly been hastily scribbled.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary said that he was not going far up the pay policy road. I thought that he spent a long time on it—although, of course, some time was spent in dealing with the BBC case. One appreciates that there are areas in which highly paid people benefited. I do not think that that was the original object of the schedule. It was aimed at helping the low paid. But the Under-Secretary spent most of his time on the BBC and Courtaulds cases and the question of the highly paid, and spent very little time discussing the problems of the low paid and how they would be adversely affected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I return to the point about profitability and speak simply from recollection of what the hon. Gentleman just said. Can he not see the distinction? What is said is that to the extent that the comparator companies take into account profitability before fixing their own wage levels, the CAC takes profitability into account, albeit indirectly. Surely that makes exactly the point that I was making—namely, that they do not take into account the profitability of the company against which the claim is made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is arguable. We could probably spend quite a time arguing round the words. There is much more in the University of Warwick industrial relations research unit's claim which gives further support to my point. However, in the end, we have a clash of evidence, whatever the Under-Secretary may say.<br><br>
He spent nearly all his time arguing that too many highly paid people have benefited from the schedule. If that were to be looked at in relative terms I think that it would be found that they were relatively few. The research underlines this. It is the low paid who have been the main beneficiaries. However, that does not mean that there is not a problem in dealing with highly paid people.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1407">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1687</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman helped me a little earlier to consider this problem by lending me some documents and I am grateful to him. He is dealing with low pay. Could he make it clear whether he is arguing about comparative low pay or absolute low pay? As far as I can see, there is no significant evidence that the CAC has had any effect on absolute low pay. It is far from clear whether it would have been desirable to do it in that way, but there seems to be no evidence that it has had any effect on absolute low pay.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, broadly speaking, that may be true. But all things are relative. If it has had an effect in terms of relative low pay, it would be foolish to pretend that that had no effect at all on actual low pay. But it would be an indirect effect, rather than a direct effect. That is probably the distinction. So I think it has had an effect on low pay generally, and therefore in absolute terms, but primarily it is on the relative situation.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman talked about the schedule conflicting with collective bargaining. Part of the case that I sought to make earlier was that, far from conflicting with collective bargaining, it gave an impetus to collective bargaining. In fact, it was inclined to bring people to the bargaining table in situations where they would otherwise not come to the bargaining table, thus making a worthwhile contribution to industrial peace. Far from conflicting with collective bargaining arrangements, I believe that this legislation actually helps to underpin those arrangements. Of course, the CAC can deal with cases only when either the union or the employer takes them there.<br><br>
I think the hon. and learned Gentleman was talking about the building industry when he talked about holiday pay, death benefits, and so on, saying that he did not think that that was of great significance or relevance. He did not think that the industry could prove anything <i>in</i> that direction. Again, it was all hearsay. I think his phrase was "I suspect that", but we have nothing more than his suspicisions to go on.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman dealt with the question of the highly paid. He may have made out a case—this is the best that could be said—for doing away with the general level provision. He made no case whatsoever—I do not think that he attempted to make a case—to do away with the recognised terms and conditions
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1688</span>
provisions. I felt that he was talking on the basis of a lawyer's brief. He was doing his client's case the most justice he possibly could, but it was a slender case.<br><br>
The Secretary of State very reasonably accepted that it is in recognised terms and conditions that the greatest difficulty arises, and that there is a case for retention, although he would not accept it at the moment. I was a little puzzled by his reference to the EEF and the CBI and the change of heart that they seem to have had in recent weeks. I suppose that his statement was based on personal contact with people there, but it is clear that no fresh evidence has been produced. Perhaps they will not be provoked into doing so, and perhaps it will be the kind of evidence that the Secretary of State hopes to receive.<br><br>
That has not happened so far, so those of us who are not privy to those discussions have to go on the basis of what has been said publicly, and what has been said publicly is on the record and stands. The record states that the EEF does not want the whole of this legislation swept away. The CBI remains divided.<br><br>
The Secretary of State very reasonably referred to the various groups of employers who had approached him recently about this matter. We should not set too much store by the fact that only a few organisations have come forward at this stage. Most of us who deal with employers and trade unions know that they are not very clued up about the kind of progress that we make in legislation going through the House. Generally speaking, they do not know what stage we have reached. It is not surprising, therefore, that only a few organisations realise that we have reached this stage of the Bill and that they should make their views known fairly quickly.<br><br>
But as the Secretary of State mentioned those employer organisations, it is worth pointing out that he might also have referred to the TUC's views. Admittedly, I did mention them in my opening remarks. The TUC does represent a very large number of affiliated trade unions.<br><br>
Our position is not a totally dogmatic one. It is true that we want the legislation to remain as it is. The legislation may have weaknesses, and perhaps there should be some consideration of the effect of the legislation on the highly paid.<br><br>
It may be difficult to separate, but I doubt if that is totally beyond the ingenuity of the Government and their Civil Service advisers and other people who have an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1408">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1689</span>
interest in bringing forward some modifications, but we believe that it should be left as it is at the moment and that they should enter into genuine discussions to see if the difficulties could be resolved without adversely affecting the low paid people in the way that we believe the Government's proposals will do.<br><br>
6.45 p.m.<br><br>
I am grateful to the Secretary of State for what he has said about receiving further representations. It will be necessary for him to publicise in an effective way what he has said in this Committee, because we cannot rely on what we say here reaching the outside world. Representations having been invited, I hope that that information</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the right hon. Gentleman addresses the Committee, I point out that we have had a wide-ranging debate on paragraphs (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>), and that I hope we do not go over them again.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1690</span>
<p>will not be buried in the <i>Official Report</i> and then forgotten. I hope that his Department will make a special effort to ensure that people are aware that the door is still just about ajar.</p>
<p>The Secretary of State said that he could give us no undertakings, so he cannot expect us to be satisfied with what he has said, even though we appreciate the gesture that he has made. We shall, therefore, seek to divide the Committee on the amendments.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 8, Noes 11.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 8, Noes 11.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wholly recognise and accept that. You took the words out of my mouth, Mr. Goodhew.<br><br>
Clause 16 deals with three repeals, two of which have been fully discussed. Personally, I have no regrets about not proceeding with the press charter. It caused me enough difficulty when I was in Government.<br><br>
I should like to press the Secretary of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1409">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1691</span>
State on one point. I shall be brief, as I am as aware as anyone else of the time, and there is a feeling in the Committee of wanting to finish reasonably early. The Secretary of State said that, in dropping the provision of the 1976 Act, which introduced the concept of the charter, he nonetheless intended to proceed by introducing a code. I wish to draw attention to the fact that the provision in the 1976 Act deals with a charter that would be intended, among other things, not only to ensure freedom of the press from industrial pressures, but to give it a number of other freedoms as well.<br><br>
Section 1A of the Act, which introduces the idea of the charter, refers to:
<br><blockquote><p>"a charter containing practical guidance for employers, trade unions and editors and other journalists on matters relating to the freedom of the press".</p></blockquote>
It was never intended that such questions of freedom should relate only to freedom from pressures generated in the area of industrial relations. That is confirmed by subsection (2), which says that
<br><blockquote><p>"practical guidance on matters relating to the freedom of the press must include guidance on the avoidance of improper pressure to distort or suppress news, comment, or criticism, the application of union membership agreements to journalists …".</p></blockquote>
The separation in that, and the way in which it is presented, clearly implies that the charter was intended to cover not merely the effects of union membership agreements on press freedom but other aspects as well. That was certainly the case in the talks that were conducted under the chairmanship of Lord Pearce, and subsequently in the lengthy consultations that I conducted at the Department of Employment.<br><br>
The subsection continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"and in particular the right of editors to discharge their duties".,</p></blockquote>
and so on. That is not simply a question of the rights of editors to discharge their duties free from any pressures that might be imposed by a trade union, but the right of editors to carry out their duties free from proprietorial pressures. Those matters are of as much concern as industrial relations matters.<br><br>
An example would be freedom of the press from improper pressures by advertisers. I cite just one example from memory of the kind of thing about which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1692</span>
we are concerned. I believe that <i>The Times</i> had £18,000 of advertising withdrawn by the Cunard company—ironically, a subsidiary of Trafalgar House, which in turn today owns Express Newspapers—because it did not like what <i>The Times</i> had been saying about Cunard. That kind of pressure is every bit as improper and as wrong as the kind of pressure that might arise from industrial relations.<br><br>
I shall resist the temptation to cite further examples and will merely say that I am hopeful that the Secretary of State will lift the veil at this stage and indicate how he envisages the form of the proposed code and perhaps something about the timing of it and whether he might be prepared to put it out in the form of a consultative document and receive comments, so that we can see whether it goes as far as some of us think and hope that it may.<br><br>
I say,that with some hesitancy and reservation in the presence on this side of the Committee of two members of the National Union of Journalists and one very active former print worker. I do not say that to encourage them, Mr. Goodhew; I merely wish to say that my remarks are conditioned and modified by an awareness of their presence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not occupy much of the Committee's time. The idea of the press charter was invented in an attempt to counteract the strident demands being made in certain quarters that journalists should be denied the rights given to other trade unionists in the 1974 Act in relation to the organisation of a closed shop. It was thought of as a means of helping journalists to have the same rights as other trade unionists. It was offered as a sop, and for that reason I do not regret its passing very much although I am worried about one or two other things.<br><br>
The arguments it was intended to counteract never had any basis in fact anyway. The existence of a closed shop in a newspaper office, whether by agreement or merely on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, has never interfered to the slightest degree with the freedom of the press. In my 30 years in the trade I never heard of a single case in which that happened, and I do not think anyone could provide an example.<br><br>
The shrill claims were advanced solely for the purpose of weakening the position of journalists as trade unionists. The people who made those claims were led by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1410">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1693</span>
Lord Goodman, who was at that time very closely involved with the proprietors of newspapers—I do not know whether he still is. They advanced the claims from the point of view of employers. They were not, and never had been, defenders of the freedom of the press. They have done more to destroy the freedom of the press, as owners, through imposing their own censorship, than anyone else. Their interests were those of employers, and the journalists' interests were those of employees. It was solely for that reason that attempts were made to deprive journalists of the right which other people were get- ting to organise a closed shop.<br><br>
I am bound to admit that, as a result of a number of clauses already passed in the Committee, opportunities for organising closed shops in newspaper offices or anywhere else will be greatly diminished in the future. That may be one of the reasons why the Government feel that there is no longer any need to bother to try to produce a charter. I do not know whether that is so, but what I have just said about the difficult- ties of organising closed shops is certainly true.<br><br>
During the debate on clause 2, we discussed the intention of the Secretary of State to produce a code of practice on this subject. I mentioned a complaint I had received from the general secretary of the National Union of Journalists. Certain assurances as to the future were given, and certain denials as to the past. The letter I received from the general secretary a day or two ago is very relevant to the repeal of the intention to produce a charter. He wrote:
<br><blockquote><p>"I am quite clear that my Union has had only one meeting with the Secretary of State, on November 23rd.… I am quite clear that that meeting was not a consultation; merely an opportunity for Mr. Prior to state what course the Government would adopt. He also inferred that in his view the Charter was a dead issue and told me, a reply to my question, that it was not in- tended to have any further meetings with the NUJ, but only to consult with ACAS in drawing up a Code."</p></blockquote>
The Under-Secretary assured me that the Secretary of State or he himself would have further meetings with the NUJ on matters arising out of the abandonment of the charter and its replacement by a proposals to introduce a code of practice. 1. hope that that assurance still stands, and that I can tell Mr. Ashton that there will be further consultations before this matter is finally concluded.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1694</span>
7 p.m.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) referred to improper pressure, and in particular the improper pressure exerted on journalists by advertisers. I can assure him—and I have no doubt that my hon. Friends who have worked in the trade will agree with me—that the worst of the improper pressure exerted on editors and journalists is exerted by proprietors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or their wives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can give two personal examples of improper pressure by advertisers. A large company that advertised widely with the newspaper that I worked for in Fleet Street, and had other interests there as well, attempted to get me sacked because it did not like a story that I had written. And when I was working on a provincial newspaper I wrote a story that offended a local advertiser, which then withdrew its advertising from the whole newspaper chain. In fairness to them, I must say that the proprietors of that newspaper were 100 per cent. with me. Attitudes vary, but these things happen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to stand between the Secretary of State and the Committee, and my remarks will therefore be very brief. But as we are referring to improper pressure, we should make the point that, so far as I know, there is no evidence of any improper pressure being brought to bear on the press by journalists in closed shops. If the Under-Secretary has any letters on this point we shall be grateful to hear about them. I do not know of any occasion when a closed shop—or trade union activity of that sort—has interfered with the freedom of the press.<br><br>
The expression "free press" is a misnomer. There is no free press in this country. The vast bulk of newspapers in this country are owned by a few millionaires. That is irrefutable. A few millionaires own the newspapers that we all read. They filter the information that the public is given.<br><br>
Some of my hon. Friends worked on publications such as the <i>Daily Herald</i> and the <i>News Chronicle,</i> which each had a circulation of over a million. A million readers were not enough. In this country it is not enough to produce a newspaper
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1411">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1695</span>
that a million people, or a million families, are willing to read. Those papers did not attract enough advertising.<br><br>
Let us take the example of the Common Market referendum. Every newspaper was on one side. A short time before he introduced his Budget, the Chancellor of the Exchequer told us that when he took office he was astonished to find how great the British EEC budget contribution was. There was no need for him to be astonished. During the referendum, numerous people who had done computations would have been willing to explain the facts to him, but not a single newspaper was willing to publish them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Proprietarily censorship.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Let us consider what happened recently on <i>The Times. The Times</i> is a great British institution, and we all missed it. The management decided that it would have negotiations with its unions. The ownership had gone across the Atlantic. New people took over. They hired new management. They gave instructions. " The best thing to do", they said, " is to put all these people outside the door, and then negotiate with them outside the door. " They thought, in their naive and innocent way, that quite soon the workers and the unions would run out of money and that the workers would come back with their tails between their legs and agree to whatever conditions the management offered.<br><br>
For virtually a year <i>The Times</i> was out of production. As the Secretary of State knows, that had all kinds of secondary effects. Paper mills and ink makers experienced great difficulties, as did the Watford printers who produced the supplements. At the end of the day, after one year's education, the management of <i>The Times</i> had to change its views.<br><br>
May I give an example of pressure from advertisers. I quote from <i>The Guardian</i> of 23 February:
<br><blockquote><p>"An MP yesterday called for an inquiry into the 'blacking'"—</p></blockquote>
I am certain that the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) will be most concerned about blacking—
<br><blockquote><p>"of a cut-price estate agency which plans to charge clients £42 to sell their homes.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The new firm, which was launched at Colchester, Essex, yesterday, aims to undercut".</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1696</span>
a good example of private enterprise—
<br><blockquote><p>"estate agents' fees by several hundred pounds.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The agency, known as House Hunters, has been banned from advertising its services in eight local newspapers controlled by the Colchester-based Essex County Newspapers group.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The group's commercial director, Mr. Colin Bell … denied, however, that he had been pressurised to 'black' the service by rival estate agents, who spend thousands of pounds a week advertising in the group's newspapers.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>But the director of House Hunters, Mrs. Julie Fuller, aged 32, claimed yesterday, that local estate agents were behind the ban. She said: 'It is obvious they are trying to put us out of business before we have even started. They are scared stiff of losing their self-appointed monopoly.'</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Mrs. Fuller claimed that an earlier advertisement in a local weekly had been taken out as the paper went to press."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Was the report in the <i>Guardian</i> an example of a free or an unreel press?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a perfect example of an unreel press. Here is a press beholden to its advertisers. Here is a firm trying to be enterprising and to place its advertisements in newspapers. But the estate agents' monopoly said to the newspaper proprietor "If you put that advertisement in, we shall take all ours out. We want you to black that advertisement. "Where is the freedom there?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Far be it from me to start discussing the relative merits and freedoms of various newspapers, whether national, local, daily or weekly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because I might be ruled out of order. I should certainly have a lot to say, but it would be highly inappropriate in this Committee. I simply say that the supposed freedom of a newspaper and what it prints is very much in the eye of the beholder. I may consider something absolutely free and right, whereas the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) may take an entirely different view. I do not wish to be involved in controversy with the hon. Gentleman at this late stage.<br><br>
However, to say that national newspapers are owned by a bunch of millionaires is really to stretch imagination too far—unless, of course, the hon Gentleman is referring to the print workers rather than to those who own the newspapers. They are the nearest that we have to millionaires

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1697</span>
nowadays, and I think that that is generally recognised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell me of a Fleet Street daily that is not owned by a millionaire?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are a number of them. In fact, with the exception of <i>The Daily Telegraph,</i> I do not think that there is a single Fleet Street daily that is not a public company. That must be made abundantly clear.<br><br>
We are straying from the purpose of this short debate. I do not wish to be sidetracked down that road. Suffice it to say that I thought—strange to say, so did most other people—that the press charter was a dead letter. As the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) intimated in his opening remarks, the trouble that he had trying to get a press charter agreed prevents him from holding particularly strong views on the continuation of that project.<br><br>
However, since I started consultations some months ago I have found that a number of people in the press think that there may be some merit in trying to reach an agreement of the kind that they sought with the last Government. I should certainly not wish to say or do anything to prevent a press charter coming about. Therefore, under clause 18 we take powers to bring in the Bill in stages. I should like to allow time for further consultations on the press charter before abolishing it.<br><br>
Some items of the press charter will be covered by the code of practice on the closed shop which we intend to introduce, and which has been dealt with at some length in the Committee. My hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary took part in that debate, and the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) had a good deal to say, too. Let me reassure him that although my meeting with the National Union of Journalists was not particularly happy, I certainly did not say that I would not consult it any more. I am perfectly prepared to consult it on the code of practice.<br><br>
I envisage that soon after the Bill receives the Royal Assent we shall publish a draft code of practice. We shall consult on that, and due course we shall lay it in front of the House. We shall certainly consult the NUJ and other interested parties. At that time we shall also see whether there is any possibility of, or indeed any desire still persisting for a press
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1698</span>
charter. There will be consultations on that point as well.<br><br>
The NUJ has a point of view to put forward. It was not one with which I felt that I could agree. However, if the NUJ wishes to put it forward there will be an opportunity for it to do so. If we can build on the meetings held by Lord Pearce we shall certainly seek to do so.<br><br>
Clearly, this is not the right time for an extended debate on press freedom. However, that problem has worried the House since the time of the introduction of the 1974 Bill. That became an Act in 1976, and, as the hon. Member for Newham, North-East will remember, the House of Lords threw it out for a year more or less on that point.<br><br>
The imposition of a closed shop in the profession of journalism has certain dangers. We do not wish to see it extended. I believe that it is better to deal with the problems on the subject that arose in relation to the press charter by means of our code of practice.<br><br>
I confirm that there will be a specific reference to the matter in the code of practice. We shall consult on the details, but I maintain that there should be a specific reference. We can then go on to see whether there is a need for a press charter. We shall not repeal that part of the 1976 Act until we have assured ourselves, until we have had further consultations, and until I have informed the House about the results of the consultations.</span></p>
<p>7.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman explain his worries? So far as I know, as regards union membership agreements in journalism, there is no suggestion that articles by politicians and prominent citizens cannot be printed. They relate more to such matters as football reports coming from non-union labour. What exactly are the right hon. Gentleman's worries? Does he think that it will stop the free expression of opinion? Is there any evidence to suggest that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I believe that there should be safeguards for an individual journalist or editor against expulsion from his union on grounds relating to his reporting of news or expressions of opinion. Secondly, a journalist or editor who does not belong to a union should be provided with an opportunity to maintain
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1413">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1699</span>
that he objects to that or any other union on conscientious grounds, which could be based on considerations of journalistic freedom. Thirdly, where there are closed shops—there are only a few—if they were to spread, they would have to obtain the high-ballot support which might be especially difficult in such an individualistic profession.<br><br>
I believe that these points ought to be considered. I do not wish to go into this in detail, but it the hon. Member had been a Member of the House in 1974, 1975 and 1976 he would certainly have found that the fears of the closed shop at that time, and subsequently, were very much in the minds of hon. Members on both sides of the House. That is why the Labour Government of the time sought the incorporation of a press charter. I believe that they were right to do so.<br><br>
I do not want to deliberate on all that now, except to say that I believe that a journalist must have absolute freedom to write, and must not feel that there is any compulsion on him to be a member of the union and necessarily to follow the union's instructions as to what he can write. In the majority of cases that is not given—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several Hon. Members</span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that there have been cases of journalists being prevented from writing what they wished to write, and I do not wish to see that any longer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for giving way to me. I was moved to intervene when he spoke of journalists being compelled by the union to write things. I do not know whether that was a slip of the tongue, but I believe that in due course it will appear in the <i>Official Report.</i> That is absolutely out of the question. Under no circumstances has the union done that.<br><br>
On the negative side, the union does have a code of conduct, to which I referred earlier. It prevents members who are journalists from writing in such a way as to bring the profession into disrepute. That seems a good thing, so I see no problem there.<br><br>
I should like the right hon. Gentleman to answer the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton). Where is there an example to support the fears that he is now express-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1700</span>
ing? It is not true that closed shops in the newspaper industry and the editorial side of the industry are rare. Until the Industrial Relations Act 1971 closed shops operated throughout the editorial departments of the industry. Perhaps Conservative hon. Gentlemen do not understand that, but it is a fact.<br><br>
Closed shops led to order and sensible negotiations in the industry. Agreements were made and observed, and there was never any trouble from the viewpoint of the general context of the freedom of the press or of an individual journalist. There has never been one incident to support the views put forward by the right hon. Gentleman. I therefore challenge him, as my hon. Friend has, to produce one single incident to support his case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add to the challenge. As I recall his words, the right hon. Gentleman said that journalists should have absolute freedom to write what they wished. But how far is he prepared to go along that road? Would he have supported Mr. Gordon Tether, for example, in the marathon case that we heard about day after day? He went to an industrial tribunal on those very grounds. In the end, the case was rejected. In that case, it was censorship by the editor.<br><br>
In fairness, I think that in the circumstances the editor had some case in his favour. Whilst I do not support the decision that the tribunal made, the case was not entirely one-sided. Nevertheless, it is a perfect example of a case in which a journalist certainly did not have absolute freedom. There are many other cases in which journalists are prevented from writing what they wish to write, or indeed in some cases are instructed to write what they do not wish to write. Their only option then is to resign.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the right hon. Gentleman like to take three points? It may be for his convenience.<br><br>
We have heard the case of Gordon Tether, who held views unpalatable to his editor, though not unpalatable to me or to many readers of the paper in question. But may I ask the right hon. Gentleman to give one example of an editor who got the sack through pressure from a trade union.<br><br>
I shall give the right hon. Gentleman an example of an editor who got the sack from the <i>Daily Star.</i> That happened in recent weeks. Who gave him the sack just
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1414">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1701</span>
like that? Who said " Finish, you are out ". The rich people—it is said that they are not millionaires—simply said, " We do not like your policies, and you are sacked", just like that. It has happened. Journalists are treated in that way. But where has that ever happened as a result of trade union pressure?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, I have stirred up another bees' nest, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) would say. I do not wish to do that at this hour of the evening. However, may I say that there are examples of journalists wishing to attend a meeting and to write up the results of that meeting, but being barred from admission because their union said that they were not to attend it. I believe that it actually happened with the Labour Party conference, or it may have been the TUC conference, a few years ago. Journalists who wished to attend but who were not members of a particular union—I think that in some cases they had been members of that union, but I should have to check that were not allowed to go.<br><br>
If hon. Members want further evidence, I refer to the special edition of the <i>Guild Journal,</i> the organ of the Guild of British Newspaper Editors, which sets out a number of cases. These things have happened. My hon. Friend mentioned the editor of the <i>Hendon Times,</i> who certainly felt that his paper was under extreme pressure as a result of union action.<br><br>
We do no good by ignoring the facts. It is far better to admit that they exist and to try to deal with the matter sensibly and</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Clause 16 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p>Further consideration adjourned.—[<i>Mr. Prior.</i>]</p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1702</span>
<p>reasonably. Of course, in certain Fleet Street newspapers a closed shop is operating which has had none of the bad effects that it may have in other places.</p>
<p>We must consider the matter sensibly. That is why we are proceeding by means of a code of practice. But to try to whitewash some of the activities of the National Union of Journalists over the last few years is to do less than credit to the intelligence of Opposition hon. Members, because in some respects it has behaved extraordinarily badly, and we all know that.</p>
<p>We are therefore trying to deal with the matter in a sensible and reasonable manner. After all, the draft charter itself said that
<br><blockquote><p>"The editor or, in appropriate cases, the editor in-chief shall accept and be accorded final responsibility for the content of his publication."</p></blockquote></p>
<p>That was agreed by all the parties. I certainly believe that that situation must persist. Therefore, there is bound to be some editorial restriction on the right of a journalist to write. But it would not be appropriate for a union to dictate what is written.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Quite right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prior</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If Opposition Members agree, they have nothing to fear from the charter or from the code. I ask them to accept the clause on that basis.</span></p>
