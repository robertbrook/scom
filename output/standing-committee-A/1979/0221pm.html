</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) for describing amendment No. 65 as a probing amendment. I entirely agree that the language here is formidable, not to say obscure, but the formulation for the calculation of compensation is exactly the same as that which is found in the Employment Protection Act. The purpose is to ensure that the maximum scales of compensation under clause 4 shall be the same as those for unfair dismissal under the Employment Protection Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member asked why 30? What is magic about that? There is nothing magic about it, but it so happens that the way in which compensation is calculated for unfair dismissal embodies this formula for the basic award. Section 73 of the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978, gives one and a half weeks' pay
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>582</span>
for years of service for the whole of which the employee was not below the age of 41, one week's pay for each complete year below 41 and not below 22, and half a week's pay for complete years below 22 and not below 18.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Act provides that no more than 20 years' service can be taken into account in calculating the basic award. So the answer to the question "Why 30?" is that 30 is one-and-a-half times 20.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next question is, why one and a half? The answer to that is that this is the maximum amount of a week's pay allowable as a basic award for compensating unfair dismissal provided under section 73 of the 1978 Act. Then, why 20 years?—because that is the maximum number of years that can be taken into account in calculating a basic award.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that I need pursue further the intricacies of this calculation. We are following the pattern for unfair dismissal under the Labour Government's legislation and, if further inquiries are thought necessary, I respectfully suggest that they be directed to the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker), who was one of the architects of that Bill. That is the reason. We do not want there to be a different formulation. We consider it appropriate that the formulation and the basis for calculation should be the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has not answered the direct question put to him by my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo). My hon. Friend asked what the amount was in cash.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sterling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sterling, my hon. Friend says—pounds, shillings and pence, as we used to say. I am glad that the right hon. Gentleman is having his attention drawn to the papers before him. My arithmetic, questionable though it may be, suggests that the amount available under subsection (7)—admittedly a maximum, but presumably the Government had in mind when setting that maximum that there might be amounts awarded up to the figure proposed in the subsection—is £6,250 from 1st February 1980, with the revised limits. Under subsection (8) the maximum available is £13,450.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary told us this morning when talking about, among other
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0816">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>583</span>
things, the division of jurisdiction, that the industrial tribunal would award only amounts that were necessary for pocket money—I think that that was his word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not the expression I used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what "pocket money" means in the circles in which the hon. and learned Gentleman moves, but I am sure that for the majority of us £6,250 is a heck of a lot of pocket money by any standards. If the hon. and learned Gentleman says that I am wrong, that it is significantly less, I am prepared to accept that. But one of the reasons we tabled the amendments was that we thought that these sums were too big in terms of the inducement that they might provide for any litigious person, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow would say, to chance his arm. As I see it, he would have nothing to lose. It would seem that, when he won his case under clause 3, there would be nothing that would automatically stop him. There would be no filter, no restriction, nothing to stop him chancing his arm, because he would have nothing to lose by applying for compensation under clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When these amounts became widely known, they would offer a significant carrot for many people to look around to see whether they could generate or synthesise circumstances in which to establish a claim to that money. The sum of £13,450 would be available under legislation. Admittedly, it is the maximum, but the Government have it in mind that it shall be available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To short-circuit what might otherwise be a lengthy debate, may I ask what happens when a union has acceded to the direction or recommendation of the tribunal but the workers refuse to accept the effect of the decision? I do not wish to go over the interesting situations which arise in my union from its division into subsections and the conflicts that sometimes arise between craft unions and others. But what happens if a tribunal says that applicant Mr. X has been unfairly excluded or unfairly refused admission, the trade union bows to that ruling saying "Very well, we will give the man his card back "but the other workers say" To hell with it. No matter what our executive council says, we will not accept him back"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>584</span>
In those circumstances, there may be a powerful case for saying that the man ought to have redress. An industrial tribunal has found in his favour. The trade union officials have accepted that. So who actually pays the money that has been awarded in circumstances in which the trade union has done everything that was expected of it and instructed its members? Can it not be the union but the individuals who continue to obstruct the implementation of both the union's and the tribunal's decision? I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will address himself to those matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had the answers to the questions which I asked partly from the hon. and learned Gentleman, who ought to have provided them all, and partly from my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker), who stepped in to fill the gaps left by the Under-Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say that the figures of £6,000 and £13,000 reinforce my fears that this will be a temptation to the litigious. Let us suppose that a chap works in a closed shop and is within a couple of years or less of ending his employment because there is an automatic retiring age in the job. What would be easier than to say "I have been a loyal member of this union all these years, but I have a strong conscientious objection to the resolution about so-and-so passed at the union's annual delegate conference last week. I cannot belong any longer to a union which passes a resolution of that sort. Therefore, I shall stop paying my subscription."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He stops paying his subscription, knowing that by the time the procedure is gone through, he is given several months' grace, and he can then appeal to the appeal committee, he will be within a short distance of the date when he would retire anyway. That is not a fanciful example, is it? That man can get away with £6,000 as terminal pay, or, if he is lucky enough to be heard by the EAT instead of the industrial tribunal, he can get away with £13,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A man may say, two years or 18 months before he is due to retire, " I have been a loyal member of this union all my 20 or 30 years in this job and I have believed in it. But now they have appointed this shop steward "—convenor, father of chapel, branch representative, or whatever—" and he is a Communist. I will not be represented by a Communist. I shall stop
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0817">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>585</span>
paying my subscription." He stops paying his subscription, knowing perfectly well that he will be excluded for doing so, that he will then have the right of appeal and that he will have £6,000 as a golden handshake before he loses his job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know what the hon. and learned Gentleman will say. He will say "reasonably". That is the word branded on his heart, as "Calais" was branded on the heart of Mary Tudor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not a bad brand to have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who is to say what is reasonable? If the chap goes before the tribunal and says "I have a conscientious objection to being represented by a Communist trade unionist"—which might be true—is that reasonable or unreasonable? Who is to say? Or he could say "I have a conscientious objection to being a member of a trade union which at its last annual delegate conference carried a resolution calling for all lawyers to be hanged, drawn and quartered"—of whatever—some outrageous political or other decision that it is not reasonable to go along with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, my solution to the problem would be different, but addressing himself to what we are now considering, surely he will agree that anyone considering what is reasonable will consider all the circumstances and not just whether someone is a Communist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what anyone would consider reasonable. I should have thought that, for example, if the hon. Gentleman himself were a member of an industrial tribunal he would consider it reasonable for a chap not to want to be represented by a Communist as a shop steward. That could happen. After all, the hon. Gentleman might get to be a member of an industrial tribunal one day—God help us. That could happen, could it not?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have said before that "reasonably" is very difficult to define. I am disturbed by the figures revealed by my right hon. Friend. The amendment was genuinely probing. I was anticipating getting the answers to my question and then asking the Committee's leave to withdraw my amendment, but I am not so inclined at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the hon. and learned
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>586</span>
Gentleman to say whether he thinks that my example of a chap packing up at the end of his career and advancing grounds—they could be grounds of conscience—is, in modern jargon, a terrible scenario, and, if so, whether he reckons that it is right that that should take place under the provisions of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must apologise to the hon. Gentleman for the fact that the second limb of the question slipped my mind. I should have answered it, and I am sorry that I did not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The maximum figures which are awardable by the industrial tribunals are as recited by the right hon. Member for Doncaster. The current maximum rates for a basic award are £3,600, for a compensatory award, £6,250, and for an additional award, £6,240. But those are maximum awards, and in no circumstances could they be awarded under clause 4, for this reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the industrial tribunal first. Under clause 4, the industrial tribunal is able to award compensation only to somebody who has had a declaration that he has, let us say, been unreasonably expelled from his union, the union has acted upon that, and then he comes back to the industrial tribunal and says "They have re-admitted me, but I have lost some money. I was out of pocket for a couple of months when I was out of work, and I am entitled to be compensated for that which I would have earned" That can be only a tiny proportion of the maxima awardable under the jurisdiction of the industrial tribunals to compensate for unfair dismissal. Incidentally, I did not use the phrase "pocket money". I said "out-of-pocket losses".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I now turn to the illustration put forward by the hon. Gentleman of the long-service employee with a couple of years to go who wishes to chance his arm and get compensation from his union for being unreasonably expelled. He says "I shall say that I do not wish to be represented by Communist employees" "Then," says the hon. Gentleman, "let us suppose that the union expels him and does not act upon the declaration. Will not that entitle him to collect a bonanza?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"No" is the answer to that. First, would the union's expulsion be regarded as reasonable? That would turn upon the facts in each case. But he would have in any event to establish that he had a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0818">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>587</span>
genuine conscientious objection of a sort that would render his expulsion from the union unreasonable. That would be the first hurdle. I am far from saying that political objections in every case, or even necessarily in any case, would be held by a tribunal to be a ground for declining to pay his subscription to the union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But let us suppose that he gets over that hurdle, a declaration is obtained, and the union do not implement it. He is then entitled, as we now all know, to go to the employment appeal tribunal and say "Please compensate me." But the basis upon which the employment appeal tribunal compensates him is for what he has lost up to that point. That will not be much; it will be on the same basis as the industrial tribunal would compensate him for what he has lost by the way of deprived earnings and earnings that he would have received—his future losses, in other words—if he had not been thrown out of the union and therefore out of his job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This man has only a couple of years to go, and therefore he will get as a maximum two years' loss of earnings but discounted for the accelerating effect of getting it all in a lump sum. Therefore, I think it is apparent that here, too, he will not get anywhere near the maximum that is stipulated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may, perhaps, be slightly misleading to provide maxima in the clause that are way above anything that in practice can be awarded. We have done that to demonstrate that we are not taking some separate basis for the calculation of awards from that by which industrial tribunals are bound in their unfair dismissal jurisdiction. We though that there were sufficient similarities to warrant the same basis being taken for those maxima, but they will not be awarded as a matter of course. I acknowledge that the matter may be slightly misleading, but I hope that I have reassured Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have spent quite a long time on the clause, for which we have tabled probing and searching amendments to try to establish what is in the Government's mind. I am sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman recognises that we are not satisfied and that we believe he is opening up something of a cesspool. We shall find out how deep that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>588</span>
is in the not too distant future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister indicate what will happen when the position arises—as it probably will—of compensation being awarded? There is likely to be a very bitter situation if the trade union refuses to pay it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should prefer not to contemplate a position in which a trade union would be in breach of law that had been passed by Parliament. That would be most out of character. Historically, trade unions have been most law abiding—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I hope that nobody will suggest that that will be any different in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A good quote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, certainly a good quote, which I hope will continue to be valid. The most recent illustration has been provided by Mr. Sirs in the case of Duport Steel 	<i>v</i>. Sirs. When the Court of Appeal granted an injunction restraining the picketing, he abided by that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must restrain himself. He need not feel that I shall rush out of the door to evade him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister does that, I shall be right behind him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a feeling that if only the hon. Gentleman understand what was behind the Government's proposals in the Bill, he would support us and we would have unanimity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trade unions have traditionally abided by the law, and obeyed High Court and other judges. I am sure that they will continue to do so. It is worth pointing out that Mr. Sirs is only the latest exponent of that very proper course. Although he believed that the judgment was likely to be overturned—and in the event it was—none the less, he abided by it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, my answer to the hon. Gentleman is simply that the position simply would not arise. If an unhappy event occurs in which a union defies an order from the employment appeal tri-banal, there is machinery for the court to enforce its own order. But we should not be contemplating such matters. We must try
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0819">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>589</span>
to ensure that we make clear and sensible law, and not consider its defiance. That would be contrary to all historical experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am particularly grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for his acknowledgment that the trade unions are one of the pillars of our law-abiding society. When one listens to the comments of some Conservative Backbenchers, one gets the impression that the trade union movement is run by raving criminals who should be flung into the nearest gaol.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, while it is true that trade unions have been law abiding over a very long period, that has applied when the law has been reasonable and fair. I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman to cast his mind back to the Industrial Relations Act, which in some respects the Tory Party seems to be trying to put back on to the statute book. My union, the AUEW, flatly refused to accept the verdict of the industrial relations court and the substantial fines that were imposed on it. He will recall the bad blood that flowed from that and the determination that grew in the trade union movement to smash the Act, which it succeeded in doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does not the Minister accept that unless he specifies the punishments in the Bill, we shall be back on the road leading to circumstances in which trade unions leaders will—or at least could—be gaoled for refusing to accept the verdicts of a court that they regard as both unfair and unnecessary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I would do justice to the hon. Gentleman, who is a very experienced member of this nation's legislature, if I were to take it that he is seriously suggesting that his trade union—or any reputable trade union—would set out deliberately to smash legislation that had been passed by a democratically-elected Parliament. So I prefer not to explore that hypothetical and extremely distasteful possibility, which I regard as exceedingly remote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to complete my answer to the points raised by the hon. member for Bethnal Green and Bow in case I should forget them again, which I

should not wish to happen. He asked what would happen if the union took someone back having said "All right, we shall implement the declaration," and then his work mates refused to work with him. So long as the union had not stirred up such a reaction deliberately, there would be a break in the chain of causation and, if the man in question subsequently lost money as a result of being dismissed, he would have to look to his employer for redress and not to the union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, if that man is granted a declaration and it has been implemented, his claim would be heard only in the industrial tribunal. He could not go to the employment appeal tribunal. That is the legal answer. But I trust that such a hypothetical position would not arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It was important for us to have that statement, because Conservative Members—especially Back Benchers—do not often say that, so it should go on record. As the hon. and learned Gentleman said, when law is promulgated, Bill Sirs accepts it. However, when the House of Lords declares the law and this Government does not like it, they do not act like Bill Sirs and accept the position. They immediately rush round changing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

not go into details, but I thought that the hon. and learned Gentleman might have done so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In subsection (7) (	<i>a</i>) the amount involved would be, according to my calculation, a possible maximum of £3,600. The £6,250 to which I referred would be an additional sum under subsection (7) (	<i>b</i>). That makes a total of £9,850. It may help the Committee for me to spell out that under subsection (8) (	<i>a</i>) "the amount referred to" comes to £3,600, under subsection (8) (	<i>b</i>) it is £6,250, and under subsection (8) (	<i>c</i>) it is £3,600, aggregating, which the tribunal may do, to £13,450. In the light of what was said by the hon. and learned Gentleman, it seems that under the powers of the tribunal it will award only a tiny proportion of what can be awarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding subsection (8), dealing with the powers of the employment appeal tribunal, the hon. and learned Gentleman said that in the light of his explanation to the Committee it should be apparent that the applicant would get nothing like the amount provided for. In that case, why put in these maxima at all? The hon. and learned Gentleman has said that the awards will be significantly less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not asked that he should accept our amendments 	<i>in Toto,</i> but surely the sense and logic of what he said is that he is accepting the principle. Why cannot the hon. and learned Gentleman say that he accepts our amendments in principle or in part and will come forward on Report with drafting that will reflect not merely what we have argued or what is said in our amendments but what he has said to the Committee? Let us have what the hon. and learned Gentleman has said put into the Bill, and not the Minister saying one thing and the Bill another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that point, I should have sat down, but I was provoked by what the hon. and learned Gentleman said about the need to encourage people to accept the laws passed by Parliament. Of course, he was absolutely right and I believe that people should accept the laws passed by Parliament. My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) made a perfectly good point that when acceptance of the law does not suit the Government's book, they are in the happy position of being able to change the law. Trade union leaders cannot change law that does not suit them at a particular time. None the less, I believe it right that people in a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>592</span>
society governed by the rule of law should accept the law. But that is not put quite as firmly and sharply as the hon. and learned Gentleman and some of his hon. Friends would have put it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the hon. and learned Gentleman to what I thought was a very sensible letter from the Conservative Member for Carshalton (Mr. Forman) that appeared in 	<i>The Times</i> on 12th February. He wrote:
	<br><q><p>"Surely our experience with the ill-fated 1971 Industrial Relations Act should have told us that legislative changes designed to bring about a more equal balance between employers and employees will only last in this country if they are made on the basis of full consultation and at least the tacit consent of those most directly affected".</p></q>
The hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham), who is a member of the Committee, wrote another interesting piece for 	<i>The Times</i> subsequent to the appearance of that letter, in the course of which he said:
	<br><q><p>"The principle behind Mr. Prior's strategy is, therefore, that the law must have the backing of those to whom it applies. Conservative attempts to introduce such legislation in the past have failed because they have not had that backing. Will Mr. Prior get it this time?"</p></q>
All those sentiments will find a ready echo in the hearts and minds of Opposition Members. I once before put to the Committee that if the two-eyed people of this country legislated in a way that discriminated against the one-eyed people, who could blame the one-eyed people if they made a Churchill an gesture to that law? The hon. and learned Gentleman must bear that in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Needham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman says that all this is a question of balance. Of course, I accept that this is a question of balance, but we are always trying to get a balance in industrial relations between the rights of employees and the rights of employers. Just as the right hon. Gentleman refers to the employees having rights, on our side of the Committee we believe very strongly that employers have rights, and just as he asks us to look after the interests of employees, so I ask Opposition Members to look after the interests of employers. It is no good their asking for balance on one side if they refuse to accept that there should be an equal balance on the other side. It is because matters have got out of balance that we have the problems we experience today.

It would be a great help if the right hon. Gentleman would apply his mind to the imbalance on employers as well as the imbalance on employees, instead of always arguing about the imbalance on one side and not on the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that there is a great deal of common ground between him and me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That gives the game away. I intended to say that, of course, we have to have regard to the interests and rights of employers as well as employees. There are legitimate areas for difference about where the balance shall be drawn, and legitimate areas for debate between the hon. Gentleman and those of his party who share his view and those in my party who share my view. But there is a great deal of common ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the hon. Gentleman will be the first to recognise that many of the provisions of the Bill and other measures that the Government are introducing in this area owe little to a desire to improve industrial relations or a recognition of the problems that exist. They owe much more to the climate that prevailed in the aftermath of last winter and the need to cash in on that at the time, heedless of the effect upon industrial relations, in order to win votes at the general election. We are lumbered with that and will suffer in the months ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When my right hon. Friend was talking about common ground with an hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to put a point to my right hon. Friend. He talked about the acceptability of law and of people making a Churchill an gesture when laws are passed that carry nobody's confidence. We shall have to read what the hon. and learned Gentleman said in his last speech very carefully indeed, because I had the impression that what he said was almost an invitation to a Churchill an gesture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman said that if in certain circumstances it was not the union that took action but its members
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>594</span>
refusing to work with a fellow, the man concerned would have recourse not against the union but against the employer. If I understood that aright, I know what advice I shall give to the members of my union. If I understood it aright, the carrying out of that advice could legally circumvent all that the hon. and learned Gentleman is after.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intended to refer to that, because I believe that the debate has won for us an important insight into the Government's thinking. We shall look again at that very carefully and ensure that those views are not overlooked in the period before the Bill is enacted or in the subsequent application of the Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following his exchange about balance with my hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham), the right hon. Gentleman may be surprised to learn that I find that there is a measure of common ground because I believe in balance between the parties. Where I take issue with both the right hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend is that, if one is to have a balance, there is a lot of room for difference according to what is put into the scales. The right hon. Gentleman puts into the scales the interests of employers and employees. I add to the scales the question of the public interest and people who are not involved. I also add questions such as freedom and liberty. These factors clearly should be part of the balance, and if they are left out one gets a different result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is implicit in all our proceedings that we have a duty to take account of the public interest. That is ironic, coming from the Government Benches. The country is reeling from the impact of a national steel strike, which is undeniably harmful to the public interest, yet the Government, who have the responsibility and are custodians of that public interest, refuse to take any action to bring that strike to an end. It is extraordinary for the Government to take the view that "These are matters that should be left to the employer and the union and we, the Government, do not have a role" The Government have a role and the responsibility, and they are not responding to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make one final point—and I am sorry to take up the Committee's time, but I have been provoked by the hon. and

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>595</span>
learned Gentleman. In talking about the need for those to whom the laws that we pass apply to accept them and to behave accordingly, we must take account, too, of how realistic it is to expect those who may feel they have been unjustly discriminated against by a law to react as we would expect them to. I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman never, never to forget the saga of the Pentonville Five. Contrary to popular conception, that was not an incident that arose from the Industrial Relations Act. It preceded it. If my memory is right, an employer sought and obtained an injunction against a group of people who were engaged in robust picketing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Robust? Lawful?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whatever word the hon. and learned Gentleman wishes. The pickets were a number of dockers not far from the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East, and they refused to obey the injunction. Because they were deemed to be in contempt of court, they were fined, I believe, £50,000. They refused to pay and subsequently were imprisoned. The effect was the instant threat of a national dock strike. It was in recognition of that reality that this hitherto unknown figure, the Official Solicitor—the good fairy—emerged from the wings and coughed up the £50,000. None of us to this day knows where that £50,000 came from to save a national dock strike, but it is open to conjecture.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman clarify a point? In referring to the measures of compensation, and calculation of compensation, he left me with the impression that he would like no limit at all. From the union point of view, that would be of concern to me. Does the right hon. Gentleman want a limit or not? I know he is querying the method of calculation, but does he think there should be a limit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has neither been listening nor taking note of what is now before the Committee. My

hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow moved an amendment, reflecting other amendments on the Notice Paper in the name of my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) and myself, which seeks to cut down the amount of compensation which is at present provided for by these two subsections. The amendments illustrate our concern that the compensation is excessive in terms of tempting people to do that which is harmful to industrial relations, amongst other things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman said that notwithstanding the high limits, he cannot envisage that those limits will ever be taken up. He said that as regards the tribunal's powers under subsection (7), the amounts awarded could only—not would only—be a tiny proportion of what could be awarded. He then went on to talk about the EAT's powers under subsection (8), and it was apparent in the light of what he said that under subsection (8) an applicant would not get anything like the amount provided for in the subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

After the Minister had given his explanation to the Committee I asked why, in the light of what he had said—he seemed to be confirming the logic of tabling these amendments—he did not accept the amendments, at least in principle or in part, because his argument to some degree reflected the arguments that we had advanced and the substance of the amendments. Therefore, we seek to cut the amounts which may be awarded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am provoked by the intervention of the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst), who talked to us about balance. This is particularly applicable to clause 4. We must consider the anomalies that will exist, and the balance that exists in the approach of the Government to this problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A non-unionist would have the right under the clause to secure compensation if he was deprived of his job as a result of not being admitted to a trade union. He can get compensation from the trade union. Compare that with the position for employers. Individuals have no redress against employers if they are dismissed because they are members of a trade union. The hon. Member for Hendon, North is a specialist on this—the guru, the adviser to Mr. Ward, where people are sacked for joining a trade union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the printing industry—my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) would know of this—there are firms which refuse to employ people who are members of a trade union. Trade unionists have no redress in law. They cannot go to any court, to an industrial tribunal, or even to the High Court, to state a claim that the employer must employ them if they are capable of doing the job or, if not, to give compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If they are already employed and have joined a trade union but—as at Grunwick—have been kicked out for doing so, they have no recourse to law. No industrial tribunal will adjudicate and award £X for the injustice that is done. That is the balance between this anti-trade union Bill and the balance which has not yet been restored to workers. If we are to have equity, why is there not some provision for people to be safeguarded, if they join a trade union movement, from getting the sack from unscrupulous employers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I anticipated, the hon. Member for Hendon, North would like to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true. But, in the case of Grunwick, the procedure which
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>598</span>
would allow the authorities to reach that conclusion was not allowed to operate. The doors were slammed in the face of ACAS. We were not allowed to ascertain whether the workers wished to join a union. Every obstacle, including High Court actions, was brought to stop the employer facing up to his obligations. Those low-paid immigrant workers who dared to join a trade union were sacked for doing so, yet the hon. and learned Gentleman has the effrontery to talk to the Committee about a balance in industrial relations. He spends much of his time now stabbing his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in the back. He has enough to do in his own party to convince them to change to his pathway without trying to convince the Opposition. We know where he stands. He does not believe in equity. Indeed, I am fairly sure that his ideal would be a type of society in which trade unions did not exist at all. Nevertheless, they exist. But the law comes down heavily on the side of the employer. Clause 4 will allow trade unionists to be penalised in the future because it may be claimed that they are depriving people of their jobs. Yet employers may deprive people of their jobs for exercising the elementary right, which has existed in this country for 150 years, to join a trade union. An employee can be sacked for that reason, and he has no remedy whatever in law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The probe that I gently pushed into the soil of the clause has dug up the one or two little artefacts that it sought. In addition, I believe—I will check when I read what the hon. and learned Gentleman said—to my great surprise and pleasure, it has fetched up a whacking great gold nugget. In the light of that, I cannot complain about the result of my probing, and seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I add this? When the hon. Gentleman raised his hypothetical case, I thought it in the interests of the Committee to answer him. I think that a very important aspect of my answer has been overlooked. I said, in effect, that if the union was not organising the action on the part of the workmates whereby the worker was not accepted, the chain of causation would have been broken. The hon. Gentleman, however, relishing—not to say gloating over—the gold nugget, as he regarded it, confided to you, Mr. Lead-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0824">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>599</span>
bitter, that he would know what to advise his union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the advice that he gives to his union is to stir it up with the workmates along the lines that it is all right if the union, in implementation of the declaration, readmits the member who has been unreasonably expelled because they can always keep him out, the chain of causation will not have been broken. The hon. Gentleman will therefore find that that does not carry him towards the destination that he imagines. The consequence would be that a substantial award could be made. That is a very important point and not to be overlooked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has misquoted me—inadvertently, I am sure. I did not say that I would advise the union. I said that I would advise the chaps at the workplace. As I am now only an ordinary lay member of my union, with no office and no authority, it would not be the union that was inciting them. It would be one of their mates, so they would be inciting themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The consequence would not be quite so happy as the hon. Gentleman thinks. If, having been readmitted to the union, the person did not get his job back as a result of the kindly advice preferred by the hon. Gentleman to his brother unionists, the industrial tribunal would be entitled under subsection (7) to make an award up to the maximum compensatory award for unfair dismissal. The award would therefore be far more substantial than if the job were given back to him. The hon. Gentleman should be aware of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I might also say, in conclusion, that I have heard no serious evidence of concern from the Opposition that there should be provision for any substantial redress for those who suffer in this way. All along, they have attacked the clause on the basis that the proposed maxima will be a substantial burden upon trade unions. I have indicated that in most circumstances the award would be far less than the maximum. But let those who say that the maximum that the employment appeal tribunal can award is too great consider the case of a rather more highly paid employee, perhaps a scientific officer, working in a closed shop industry. He is not two years from retirement, as in the illustration offered by the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>600</span>
hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow, but has a long way to go. If that person is unreasonably expelled and the union does not implement the declaration, he can look forward to a substantial number of years before him in which he will not be able to pursue his trade.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like Derek Robinson.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In those circumstances, I make not the slightest apology for the fact that the Government have his interests in mind in providing for a substantial maximum which could be awarded by the employment appeal tribunal. I should take the Opposition's protestations about their belief in a balanced approach rather more readily if there were occasionally some evidence of a belief, on their part that a provision of this kind was necessary, desirable and just.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we drop the subject altogether, may I say that the difference between us seems to be that the Opposition do not accept that any wrong can be done in excluding or expelling a person from membership of a trade union. If they do not accept that, it follows inevitably that they see no justification for compensation when a wrong has been done. There will therefore never be agreement between the two sides of the Committee on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A few minutes ago, Mr. Leadbitter, I sought permission to withdraw the amendment. Manifestly, that permission was not granted, as you then called the hon. and learned Gentleman. There has now been an intervention by the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst). We may therefore continue the debate, which I thought had been pretty well exhausted. I though that I was serving the Committee. Clearly, some members of the Committee, at least, do not wish to be served in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore take the opportunity to say that the interpretation being placed upon the attitude of the Opposition is not justified at all. We have had a debate in which hon. Members on the Government side have put one side of the argument and we have put the other. That is how balance is achieved. If Government supporters wish to put the one side of the argument with a 10 per cent. reservation for the other side, we will put the other side of the argument with a 10 per cent. reservation for the one
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0825">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>601</span>
side. But it is nonsensical to claim—and it is stingingly hypocritical for the hon. Member for Hendon, North to claim—that the Government maintain a balance while the Opposition consider only one side of the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spent a lot of time in my own union defending the rights of the individual member. When people sought to nominate me to the appeal court of the union, I refused the nomination because I did not think that I was worthy to sit in judgment on fellow members of the union in causes of action between them and the national executive committee. I therefore do not have to apologise to the hon. Member for Hendon, North—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not ask you to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—for my concern for the individual rights of members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we have said over and over again, we had in mind the person who deliberately took advantage of legislation of this kind to stir up trouble. We do not want those chaps, and I do not know why Government supporters should want them. One has to distinguish between cases like that and cases such as the example of the scientific officer cited by the hon. and learned Gentleman which are genuine. So far as possible, we have to try to draft legislation which covers the two different kinds of case. That is no easy task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we are allowed to continue the debate, I say again that I shall read with care what the hon. and learned Gentleman said about groups of employees refusing to work with a man. I listened with great care, as I always do to the hon. and learned Gentleman. If I heard him aright, it will be difficult for him to put any interpretation on his words other than that if a man in the circumstances we were discussing finds that his work mates in the shop spontaneously, of their own volition, decide that they do not want to work with him, that man's remedy is with the employer and not with the trade union.

Friends to vote against this clause, too, for basically the same reasons as before.

We think that substituting judicial bodies for voluntary procedures is not likely to be beneficial to industrial relations. It is an unnecessary interference in the internal affairs of trade unions. It imposes on people who are not involved in nor responsible to trade unions the obligation to make interpretations and judgments that they may be ill-qualified to make about matters that they may be embarrassed to have to pass judgment upon. As has just been argued, the amounts of compensation that are now trailed before those who may be tempted to go to the tribunals could of itself encourage litigious, frivolous and vexatious applications to tribunals.

Doubtless we shall be discussing the following matter when we debate clause 5. We hear repeated expressions of concern from Government supporters about the number of applications to industrial tribunals in connection with unfair dismissal. In the Government's view many of those cases ought not to have been brought.

The clause is short. Nonetheless the Opposition regard it as particularly important. Before I deal with the amendment, may I begin by pointing out to the hon. and learned Gentleman what appears to be a drafting error. If he looks at the clause as drafted he will see that the way that it is proposed to insert words into section 57(3) of the 1978 Act will not make sense. Some words have been missed out of the drafting. I am trying to help the Government here. It ought to start from the words "satisfy the tribunal" rather than from the words "the employer can". The hon. and learned Gentleman will see that he needs to do a little redrafting there—he may pass on a small nominal fee in due course if he so chooses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>jurisdiction of industrial tribunals.</p>
	<p>I shall not detain the Committee any longer, as the Opposition wish to move on to the next clause. I urge my right hon Friends to divide the Committee and to vote against the clause standing part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 11, Noes 9.</p>
	<p>Government's draftsmen to sort out their own errors of draftsmanship.</p>
	<p>When the Secretary of State spoke on Second Reading, he referred particularly to clauses 5, 7 and 8 which amend the law on unfair dismissal. He summarised the situation thus:
	<br><q><p>"they have the purpose of reducing the burden imposed on employers, especially small employers. This burden, perceived and real, has been a deterrent to the employment of more people. They would require an industrial tribunal to take account of the size and administrative resources of a firm in deciding the fairness or unfairness of a dismissal."</p></q>
It is that which we seek to amend. He continued:
	<br><q><p>"They would also exempt new firms, with fewer than 20 employees, from the unfair dismissal provisions for the first two years after they take on their first employee."</p></q>
In response to a request for an assurance that that would mean more people being employed by small firms, the Secretary of State replied that he could not give that assurance, but that
	<br><q><p>"I might be able to give the hon. Gentleman another assurance, that it will not be possible for small employers any longer to argue that the Employment Protection Act is a deterrent to the employment of labour."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 17th December 1979; Vol. 976, c. 64.]</p></q>
I shall try to show that such misgivings, if indeed they exist, are ill-founded—hence our belief that the amendment is necessary.</p>
	<p>The Under-Secretary of State himself said in July 1979:
	<br><q><p>"there is … overwhelming evidence that the present provisions frustrate and unreasonably curtail the creation of jobs".—[	<i>Official Report,</i>24th July 1979; Vol. 971, c. 520.]</p></q></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0827">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>605</span>
	<p>Yet the Secretary of State, speaking on the same day, made what seemed to be a contradiction of that. He said:
	<br><q><p>"I can be no more certain than Labour Members that what we are doing will help small businesses, especially to employ more people."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 24th July 1979; Vol. 971, c. 497.]</p></q></p>
	<p>They do not seem to be on all fours with each other.</p>
	<p>Paragraph 10 of the Government's consultative document or working paper said:
	<br><q><p>"There are, however, difficulties in imposing different requirements on firms simply by reason of their different sizes. It would generally be undesirable to give special treatment to small firms in a way that would, on a permanent basis, create a 'second tier' of employees who have less protection, especially since protection is no less necessary in small firms than in large. There are also problems associated with the definition of a 'small' firm and the imposition of an arbitrary cut-off."</p></q>
Having said that, they went on to create precisely the situation they said they did not wish to encourage. If the Bill is enacted, they will have created that two-tier system.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A mini U-turn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend says that it is a mini U-turn, and that is a fair way to describe it. It is clear that employers in these firms will enjoy a novel provision. If they are in financial difficulties, presumably it will be possible for the tribunal to take account of it. Because of this Government, more and more firms are getting into financial difficulties. I notice that the figures for bankruptcy published the other day show a pretty dramatic increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other areas of their activity, those same firms would not be allowed exemption. Even if they get into financial difficulties, they will still have to meet their bills, fulfil their contracts, and so on. But their obligations to their workers are to be quite different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The size of the firm is relevant in that it is in the small firms that workers need special protection. That is recognised by the existence of statutory minimum wage levels and other conditions of employment in small firms. About 3 million employees are covered by wages council legislation. That in itself is a recognition by successive Governments of the need for special protection for employees in small firms, and we all know that, despite that type of protection, there is a considerable history of under-payment by employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, successive Governments have sought to recover money for workers who
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>606</span>
were underpaid. It is worrying that at the same time as this legislation is going through Parliament, it appears likely that the Government will run down the wages inspectorate, so another area of protection for workers in small businesses will be seriously undermined. The previous Government spent much time building that up after the Conservative Government before them had, in their turn, undermined the operation of the wages inspectorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in the small firms that protection is particularly necessary. The Bolton committee on small firms estimated that only 8 per cent. of small firms were fully unionised, and it is true that the trade union movement could do more to recruit from within the small firms sector. But one recognises the difficulties and problems of economies of scale and of servicing workers in small firms, so we return to the need for protection. The Government are now doing the reverse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been many protests about this legislation. Naturally, they have come from such bodies as the TUC and individual unions and, because they are perhaps the obvious protesters, I will not dwell unduly on what they have said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will quote from a number of sources, but I wish now to pick up what was said on this proposition by the Low Pay Unit. It said that there was very little sign that employment legislation in general or the Employment Protection Act in particular was inhibiting industrial recovery or contributing to the high level of unemployment by discouraging employers from taking on new people. Talking of research studies commissioned by the Department of Employment and the Manpower Services Commission, it said that only 17 per cent. of managers sampled were prepared to say that the unfair dismissal provisions had had "a good deal" of effect, and much of this took the form not of altered recruitment decisions but
	<br><q><p>"the reform or formalisation of procedures adopted in taking disciplinary action and executing dismissals."</p></q>
Only 3 per cent. reported redundancy procedures as having a good deal of effect. Only 2 per cent. said the same of redundancy payments, and only 3 per cent. found guarantee payments an important factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A similar study found an even more restricted impact on small firms. I was referring to medium-sized firms at the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0828">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>607</span>
beginning, but there was a similar situation, with even more restricted impact, on small firms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industrial relations research unit of the Social Science Research Council at the University of Warwick produced a great deal of evidence in its study on the proposed amendments to this legislation, much of which is relevant to clause 5. There is particular reference to press coverage, much of which, it states, gives the impression that the unfair dismissal legislation is very restrictive. The document states:
	<br><q><p>"…it may be that the criticism and anxiety expressed by small employers arise from misunderstanding or ignorance of the legislative provisions. If this is the case, changing them"—</p></q>
the legislative provisions—
	<br><q><p>"(as with the qualification period, now 52 weeks) will make little difference to the employer while diminishing the rights of employees."</p></q>
Paragraph 6 states:
	<br><q><p>"As there appears to be very little evidence that the employment protection legislation is inhibiting recruitment, it can be argued that, in terms of the Government's major concern, there is no need for any legislative amendment. There is, however, a second general assumption in the introduction to the Working Paper—</p></q>
the Government's working paper—
	<br><q><p>"which needs to be addressed, that provisions of the employment protection legislation bear over-harshly on employers, especially in small businesses."</p></q>
It deals with that point again later in the document when, quoting its own evidence, it states in paragraph 34:
	<br><q><p>"It has been shown … that small firms do not see the employment protection legislation as particularly burdensome and it was argued that legislative protection is not just 'no less necessary in small firms that in large', as the Working Paper notes, but 	<i>more</i> necessary."</p></q>
That underlines the point I was making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other sources which I should like to quote. The Association of County Councils is, of course, a body that is dominated by the Conservative Party. In its comments on clause 5 the Association
	<br><q><p>"expressed reservations about the proposals brought forward in the Bill requiring tribunals to have regard to the size and administrative resources of the employer's undertaking in unfair dismissal cases. This provision is bound to result in stricter criteria applying to large public authority employers than to smaller employers in the private sector, thereby creating a 'second tier' of employees."</p></q>
The same point again—the two tiers. It continues:
	<br><q><p>"The Association feel that an employee's position under the law should not vary according
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>608</span>
to whether the employer is big or small, young or old."</p></q>
The Royal College of Nursing commented similarly. It sees
	<br><q><p>"…no reason, in equity, why protection against unfair dismissal should vary depending upon the size and administrative resources of the employer's undertaking".</p></q>
The Migrants' Action Group has issued a pamphlet on the same subject. It is concerned with migrant workers in low-pay industries—hotels, shops, restaurants, laundries and so on—where pay and conditions have always been bad and continue to be. It believes that the effect of the Government's proposals in those areas will be nothing short of disastrous. In respect of the proposal that the tribunal should take account of the size and administrative resources of a business, it points out particularly that in the hotel and restaurant business employers
	<br><q><p>"could claim that there were too few staff to establish proper procedures for dismissals, such as warnings and full investigations."</p></q>
It also registers its concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Equal Opportunities Commission, although it is true that it was not referring specifically to the clause, made very clear its anxiety about that sort of proposal. It is particularly concerned because there is a preponderance of women working in small firms of that type.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting, after those examples of concern, to reflect on how the Government arrived at their conclusion and the decision that such a change was necessary. As I have mentioned the research commissioned by the Government showed very little evidence that employers consciously felt any burden on them. We have had references to opinion polls from Government supporters in the Committee and on the Floor of the House. They have been cited as evidence for the need for the major changes that are proposed in the Bill on such matters as State aid for ballots, closed shops and picketing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For my part, I would not deny that the public view is that such a change might be made. But we believe that when it is made there will probably be a very different public reaction. While the Government may be able to claim that they have a mandate on the matter, none the less I do not believe that the changes are wise or practical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, on this specific matter all the evidence points the other way. There is nothing to show that there is real concern,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0829">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>609</span>
even among those who are directly involved, that such a change is required. I believe that the Minister has responded to pressure groups, and Conservative Party supporters in particular from the small firms lobby, which has been campaigning for a long time. No doubt I shall be corrected if I am wrong, but I believe that it received more than just a helping hand from the Government. The Minister actually wrote to some of the pressure groups inviting them to give their views about the matters that the clause is intended to cover.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Needham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Member suggesting that the only reason that pressure has come from small business interests is to push the Government towards a change in the law to reduce their workers' rights? Does he believe that they are bothered not about the way that the law will operate but because they are ruthless employers and wish to do away with the rights of those whom they employ?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real reason behind the legislation is that the previous Government introduced law that was not fully understood by the vast majority of small employers. However good that law may have been and however reasonable it was to ask them to behave in a similar way to large companies, small employers did not understand it. That may have been partly their fault, but the problem is that the previous Government did not do enough to explain the application of the law, which is why many small employers are frightened about how it will work and are not taking on people whom they otherwise would. That is not because they want to misuse their position as employers to undermine their workers' rights. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has generalised in precisely the same way as the Government have. He has come forward with a proposition, but he has given no evidence to show that small employers feel the same way as he does. The leadership of the small firms' lobby is a different matter from the people who are actually in business throughout the country. There is a considerable distinction between the two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As with so many who are in the leadership of an organisation, perhaps they feel they must make a case about something. It is only natural that in this specific sphere of operation they have a general feeling
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>610</span>
against legislation. They want the least possible law on small firms. I believe that having started along that road, they have ended by putting pressure on the Government. But I believe it most unlikely that their view is an accurate reflection of that of their membership. I shall come to that matter later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the Minister wrote to such organisations specifically inviting them to give him their views. I am not aware that he wrote to individual trade unions, for instance, although I do not doubt that he wrote to the TUC and the CBI. But did the Minister go beyond that in respect of the employees' side? Perhaps he did; it will be interesting to hear what he says. Certainly, the Minister fanned the flames to some extent to ensure support for the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department's statistics show that about half of all the registered unfair dismissal claims involve firms employing fewer than 100 people and almost a quarter involve those with fewer than 20. It is clear that there is a serious problem for workers in small firms. I believe that the proposal entails a highly selective approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned earlier that I would come to the point about the evidence which the Government have produced in support of their case. I have a document that refers to the analysis of that evidence which was carried out by Ava Westrip for the small business research unit at the Polytechnic of Central London. Her conclusion was that:
	<br><q><p>"Given that many of these associations "—</p></q>
that is, those of small firms—
	<br><q><p>"have a declared aim to reduce legislative provisions that impinge on the business community"—</p></q>
which is what I have been saying—
	<br><q><p>"it follows that their membership will consist mainly of those small businessmen that feel most strongly that Government action reduces their freedom. This argument must apply with even more force to those members that take time and trouble to complete the questionnaires.…</p></q>
The 'surveys' were rarely found to be representative of the association's membership"—
she is talking about the surveys of small firms—
	<br><q><p>"let alone of small firms in general. The National Federation of the Self-Employed, for instance, declared that Employment Protection had damaged 50 per cent. of their members, yet 98 per cent. of their membership had not replied to the questionnaire at all. Moreover the conclusion was based on the replies of a sub-group of 71 per cent. of respondents that had agreed to the proposition that the law had damaged their business in the past five years. Four-fifths of the membership of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0830">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>611</span>
the Engineering Employers Federation, whose research was specifically cited by Patrick Mayhew in the parliamentary debates on the legislation, failed to reply to the Federation's request for 'evidence that Employment legislation had inhibited recruitment'. Of its 6,500 member companies, only 168 said, in reply to a prompted question, that employment legislation was the most significant factor in restricting recruitment.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>"A common feature of the pressure group surveys was found to be their use of leading questions, which the DE research has shown to be of considerable importance in this area. The Small Business Bureau, based in Conservative Central Office, asked its membership to provide it with ammunition' in a survey entitled Employment Protection or Prevention. Two-thirds of the membership responded, and one may assume that these were the ideologically most vociferous."</p></q>
I shall not go on much longer with the quotation, except to say that, summarising her analysis, Ava Westrip concluded:
	<br><q><p>"It is an essential part of the function of a pressure group to obtain publicity for its view; but to suppose that the results of their surveys are impartial, or are comparable with the standards of independent research utilising sophisticated statistical techniques is somewhat naive. And yet the Government claimed that the evidence was 'overwhelming'."</p></q>
That is an overwhelming rejection of the Government's equally overwhelming claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, the Government are taking a highly selective approach. It seems to me that a dismissal is either fair or it is not fair. The clause means taking a retrograde step that can only damage the interests of that part of the work force least able to look after itself and I do not believe the case for the need for that kind of change has been made. On this point, the Government can in no way claim that they have a mandate to go ahead in that way. I do not believe that their explanations to date have any credibility, and, at the very least, the hon. and learned Gentleman should accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend spoke of the small firms lobby. I am a member of that lobby and spend a sizeable proportion of my time and energy outside the House in chairing an organisation which looks after small firms in the borough one part of which I represent in this House. It is quite a big job that is interesting and highly educative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I advise the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) that what is worrying small firms is not to be found on the basis of what a politically slanted, or, to use the classic phrase, a politically motivated,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>612</span>
organisation in the Conservative Central Office guesses to be their attitude or what it deduces from a highly partial questionnaire. I advise the hon. Gentleman from what I have seen in the firms themselves that they are worried about having to pay nearly 20 per cent. on any money they wish to borrow for stock. That is a frightful burden on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of them are worried because they are in competition with dumped imports and because the Government do not have the guts to implement their anti-dumping legislation. Those are the sorts of issues that worry them. They are worried about the fact that the banking system in this country is not flexible enough by comparison, for example, with the banking system of the Federal Republic of Germany to deal with the needs of small firms in the way that their needs for finance often have to be satisfied—a way that sometimes involves the source of that finance looking at something more than the profit and loss account and balance sheet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the sort of thing that worries them. I have not had a single firm in my borough say to me that legislation is the reason it is in difficulty. The Government are tending more and more to depart from principle and what my hon. Friend said in the latter part of his speech is absolutely right. A principle is a principle—and that applies equally to a large firm, a medium firm and a small firm. The Government are starting on a course of action that could spread out in all sorts of directions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the distinction in clause 5 and, when we come in a later part of the Bill to deal with provisions for maternity, another distinction is again drawn. It may not stop there. Once one starts with the idea that one has to give relief from the law to organisations, not in accordance with their circumstances but in accordance with their size, all sorts of vistas open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I predict that next will come a demand that small firms should be relieved from all the obligations they carry under health and safety regulations. We shall be told that small firms cannot carry the obligations of health and safety regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will have noted the proposals for so-called free enterprise zones in the inner city areas that are being discussed within the Government, which we have not yet had spelt out to us. He and I, as Members representing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0831">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>613</span>
inner city areas, together with others of our hon. Friends are deeply disturbed by that prospect. The sort of situation described by my hon. Friend will arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. When I asked what was meant by a "free enterprise zone", I was told that it is a zone within which there would not be the full rigour of health and safety regulations, or the full requirements of the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act. That is the next thing that may come along. A further point about free enterprise zones is that people will be able to build where they like, do what they like and shut off others' ancient lights because they will not need to obtain planning permission and so on. This is the beginning of what could be a very slippery slope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the question of the ability of a firm to carry out its obligations under this clause and clauses 10 and 11 and the other instances I have given because their abilities do not always depend upon size. As my hon. Friend said, there are many small firms which, because of the idiotic economic policy of the Ayatollah Joseph, are facing grave difficulties and some are becoming bankrupt. But some small firms are very prosperous indeed for a number of quite different reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one has a business in which the ratio of profit to turnover is high and the turnover per employee is also high, one can have a great deal of profit with only a small number of people on the payroll. A great many prosperous firms of architects, accountants and lawyers are small firms. They have high profit in relation to turnover, and high turnover per employee, and they are very profitable indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find significant that the clause requires the size and administrative resources to be taken into account but not the financial resources of undertakings. Why are financial resources omitted? If financial resources were included, that would cover the firms I have mentioned which are small in size if size is measured by the number of employees. There is nothing in the Bill to indicate which we measure by numbers of employees, but turnover, by profit or whatever else, but normally when one talks of a small firm one talks about the number of employees and the space required to house them. If the clause mentioned taking into account the size, administrative and financial resources, these small firms that do so well would be caught. Is that why

"financial resources" was left out?

There are a lot of very small firms which have a big turnover because to a great extent they rely on outworkers. There are firms in the rag trade in my constituency that have only two or three people present but they can have 80 or 100 out-workers who are not, of course, employees; they are paid by the piece and are not on the payroll. The production, turnover and profit per employee of such firms are therefore very high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only in the rag trade that one finds a high turnover achieved with a small number of people. One can find outworkers in all sorts of trades. There are research and development organisations which rely on only one or two full-time members of staff plus freelance services paid for by fees and not by wages, or they call in consultants to help. There are contract drawing offices where there are perhaps two or three administrators in the firm who call upon the services of freelance services of draughtsmen all over the place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know one excellent small business which consists of one chap and his wife who run a technical translation bureau. They do a very good job for many British exporters, and I hope that they go on doing well. There are only the two of them, and they each have two languages. They translate not into four languages but into over 40 languages. That is because they have freelance translators all over the place whom they pay by the piece. They are paid so much per 100 words, and are not on the payroll. So there is this tiny firm with a large turnover and a high rate of profit per employee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to draw fair lines about this, especially if we exclude, as the Government have excluded, the word "financial" from the criteria. Where lines are difficult to draw, the first thing to do is to rest on principle. If a dismissal is fair, it is fair anywhere, and if it is unfair, it is unfair anywhere—big or small. My hon. Friend is right. There has been a deliberate put-up of a lobby which is not a genuine lobby.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My experience is that the chaps on the ground who are trying to build up a small firm from nothing have not the time to fill up political questionnaires. They are not the bods who reply to the small business bureau of the Conservative central office. They are too busy struggling hard to make a living in the economic blizzard which the Government have let loose upon their poor defenceless heads.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Needham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the hon. Gentleman to go back to the example of the translation bureau which he talked about, where two people, husband and wife, both have two languages and use a large number of outside people who are not employees. Let us suppose that several of them, for one reason or another, were employees. Are there any people less likely to understand the complexities of the Employment Protection Act, agreement procedures, contracts of employment and so on, than the two people whom the hon. Gentleman has instanced. They are exactly the people who would not understand it all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not mean that they are unthinking or unreasonable people. Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that should something go wrong or should one of their employees not be able to do his work as they would wish, they have to go through all the complexities that ICI goes through? Surely, that is one of the very good reasons why they do not take on people and expand their business. It is so complicated for them to do so. The hon. Gentleman answered the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only reason they do not take on people to expand their business is that they can expand their business more easily by not taking on employees and by using people freelance. As the hon. Gentleman has picked on that example, which I cited only as an exaggerated case, let me tell him that people capable of translating international contracts certainly can understand legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, what a strange theory the hon. Gentleman is putting forward—that we should be bound only by legislation that we do not understand. How many small business men understand tax legislation, income tax legislation and capital tax legislation? Is he saying that we should not require them to pay their income tax because they do not understand all the minutiae in the legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a problem when the small employer does not understand the legislative requirements, especially in my example of the wages council. I accept that there are many small employers who have difficulty in understanding the legislation, but I hope that no one will suggest that that wage legislation should be swept away. One hears disquieting rumblings from within the Government, but
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>616</span>
I should be deeply disturbed and surprised if that happened. I am sure that my hon. Friend will agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do, and I am obliged to my hon. Friend. It is a most strange thesis that the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) is putting forward. But there is a great case for providing organisations which give advice to people who need advice and guidance in understanding legislation. That is one of the functions of my centre for small business. People ask us about this and that. If we know, we provide an answer, and if we do not, we tell them where to get an answer. It is always possible to get information if one wants it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government were not cutting public expenditure and if they were to spend a bit more on the small firms advisory bureau of the Department of Industry, that could be very helpful. If the hon. Gentleman is anxious that small businesses should have access to information and understanding, perhaps he will put some pressure on the Ayatollah to increase rather than decrease the provision for the Department of Industry's small firms advisory bureau, which is a valuable organisation. It could do much more, especially if it harnessed the work of voluntary bodies, such as the one with which I am associated, to the maximum possible extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Imagine my entering an appeal to the Inland Revenue against its assessment of my liability for income tax and citing as ground for my appeal "As I do not understand the intricacies of the Finance Act, I ought not to be liable to pay tax" Perhaps I shall try it on next time. I shall add "P.S. If you think this is not a very good case, please understand I have the reinforcement of the hon. Member for Chippenham in what I say." That really will not do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end on the note on which my hon. Friend ended. If a dismissal is fair, it is fair, anywhere; if it is unfair, it is unfair anywhere. The distinction which is sought to be drawn—and these words are in parentheses—is not a meaningful distinction and they ought to be got rid of.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is not without significance that this is a nine-line clause. It may well be tempting to some hon. Members to consider restraining others who sweep broadly across the clause into what might appear to be Second Reading speeches. I have looked at the clause with great care, and I must advise the Committee that the clause itself, though small, refers to and springs from section 57(3) of the 1978 Act. That subsection refers specifically to subsection (1). It is, therefore, a broad, general, complex clause, and I hope that hon. Members who are tempted to jump up on points of order either because of the length of speeches or because they are broad-sweeping will bear in mind that the Chair will not accept such points of order. All other points of order will be taken, but clause 5 is a much broader clause than some hon. Members may be tempted to assume.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intervene now because if we run into a series of points of order that will waste our time. Having heard the Chair's observation, the Committee will, I am sure, maintain its usual good sense and balance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo), I was astonished to hear the doctrine laid down by the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham). I am saddened that in his quieter moments he will rethink that doctrine and revise it, and come to the conclusion that that was not the sagest pieces of advice he has given us—to suggest that if rights are not understood, they should be taken away, or rendered nugatory or void, and if law is not understood, we can quite cheerfully dispense with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Needham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt again. I did not say that or intend that. My point is simple. It is not that there should be two classes of law, one for the small business man and one for the large business man. It is purely and simply that the law as it is currently put forward is not understood by many small business men. It is not sufficient that that is stated in polls, because small business men do not have enough time to fill in polls, nor do they have the time to fill in forms sent by the Government on other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My argument is not that there should be two classes of employers in Britain, but that it should be open to small employers to understand the law and that it should
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>618</span>
be put forward to them so that they can participate. They cannot do that at the moment because the law has not been properly explained to them, and as a result of that lack of explanation they are very dubious about taking on more people. That is the responsibility and onus of the right hon. and hon. Gentlemen on the Opposition Benches who introduced the legislation on the matter and did nothing to get it across to the people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because of his geographical position, the hon. Member for Chippenham will not have seen the smile on the face of the Under-Secretary while he was talking. I suspect that a reason for that smile may be that most of us do not understand our rights under the law. I am certainly not an expert on the law. If we get into trouble, what do we do? On occasions we turn to lawyers for advice. I should hate to think that just because I personally did not know the whole of the law by heart or rote, my rights did not exist. The whole 	<i>raison d'être</i> of the legal profession is to help us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the second intervention of the hon. Gentleman rendered his thesis any more valid. I am certain that when he reads his words in 	<i>Hansard</i> tomorrow, there will be no reason to think that they were any better the second time around than the first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we shall hear more from hon. Members on the Government Benches on this clause. We are dealing with principles, and I think that this is highly unprincipled. In our debate so far I have not used any emotive language, but I feel very strongly on this. It is a mean, squalid and unworthy clause. In particular, it is an unprincipled clause. I should like to hear from Conservative Members who were so eloquent on the previous clause, when we were dealing with exclusion from employment by trade unions. We discovered that there were only about four cases. We spent a good deal of time on the procedures and remedies available to people, and the large sums of money they would have in compensation. That was explained to us as something of the highest importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now we turn over the coin. When we are dealing with our fellow citizens' employment and what happens when they are sacked by their employers, we find an entirely different attitude. Hon. Members spoke about civil liberty and the rights of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0834">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>619</span>
the individual. Surely an individual is an individual; perhaps even more so if he works for a small firm. Why should we all work for large firms? We have heard much of the philosophy that small is beautiful. We want to encourage the small firm. Surely the individual is as much an individual in a small firm?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having heard about the rights of the individual and civil liberties, I hope, therefore, that we shall hear from Conservative Members how they will stand up for the rights of the individual under this clause and how they will uphold the law. I want to hear from the Under-Secretary in particular, because if some of his colleagues do not understand the principles involved, I am certain that he does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the clause seems to do is to give us a sliding scale of justice. One can get justice if one works for a firm employing so many people; but if the firm is smaller, under English law one does not have so many rights. There is a sliding scale of justice. There are two classes of citizens. There will be a double standard expressly written into English law. That is the astonishing suggestion before us. I want to hear from the exponents of civil liberty and the rights of the individual how they justify this legal apartheid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Bill eventually winds up on the statute book, I suppose that the moral is "Do not work for a small firm."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong. The moral, if there is any moral involved, is not "Do not work for a small firm" but "Help to make that firm a big firm"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, the reply to the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) is that because of the nature of the legislation, there will be a built-in pressure for the small firm not to become a big firm. The pressure will be on the small firm to exclude itself from protective legislation by remaining small.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) has put his finger on it. I suspect that what will happen will be this. If the upper level is 20, when the employer finds his business developing and he reaches the level of 19, he will set up another company. That company will employ 19 second-class citizens. I am certain that in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>620</span>
for Bethnal Green and Bow, firms start up, shut down, break the law, open up again, or might have half a dozen firms, probably in the same street. That is the moral of the story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could even be that the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst), in the advice he gives numerous employers, would say "Don't let your firm get too big. Set up a number of subsidiaries." I should not like to think that we shall have this double standard. I shall listen with the greatest interest to how the Under-Secretary seeks to justify it in English law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find the principle of first-class and second-class citizens utterly repugnant. I make that clear as my first and fundamental objection to the clause. Frankly, I am amazed that any Government in a supposedly civilised country should seek to introduce such a principle in a context as important as employment. It would be repulsive anywhere, but in a matter which concerns people's livelihoods it is incredible that a supposedly civilised Government should even contemplate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The novel doctrine advanced by the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) has been well demolished by my hon. Friends—so effectively, indeed, that he actually denied having said it. If he did not make himself clear at the first and second attempts, I was certainly no clearer about it after the third. He still seems to me to be saying that those who do not understand the law should be exempt from it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He does not understand the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Frankly, he does less than justice to many small business men. They are not as stupid as he suggests. They are not all daft. They are not all incapable of understanding what unfair dismissal is. Most of them understand perfectly well, especially those who have been organising the pressure group that has led to this campaign to get themselves exempted. They know perfectly well what it is. If that is the only reason, as it appears to be, for opposing our amendment, the Government should have the good sense to scrap the new system proposed in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) pointed out, the same principle might be extended to other areas. He mentioned the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0835">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>621</span>
Health and Safety at Work etc. Act and the Offices, Shops, and Railway Premises Act. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) spoke of the possibility of its being extended to planning and building regulations. There is also the redundancy payments legislation. Where do we stop? What about wages council decisions? Are we to have decisions specifying one minimum wage for employees in firms of a certain size and a another for those in slightly larger firms?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentions extending this principle to other areas. Surely he has read of suggestions within the Tory Party that there should be zones within inner city areas which would be exempt from planning laws, byelaws and a whole host of regulations—even, it seems to be suggested in some quarters, from taxation. That is an example of the remarkable way in which the Tory mind is turning in this modern day and age.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Environmental organisations such as the Town and Country Planning Association, of which I am a member of the executive, are extremely concerned about that matter, as are local authorities. As my hon. Friend rightly says, it is the same principle. There is no difference between the two suggestions in terms of the underlying theory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I become more and more amazed as the Committee proceeds. The party that is supposed to be the champion of small firms is here providing a positive disincentive for anybody to work for one. How do the Government reconcile that with their supposed championship of small businesses? This legislation is the most positive discouragement possible to anyone thinking of working for a small company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, the Government are supposed to be the champions of the individual. Yet here they seek to deprive individuals working for small companies of rights that those working for larger companies will retain. I do not understand how they reconcile these provisions with the doctrines about the freedom of the individual and the championship of small enterprises that they constantly advance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is just as offensive, damaging and degrading to be dismissed by a small firm as to be dismissed by a large one. If I were working for a small firm and I felt that my rights against
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>622</span>
my employer with regard to dismissal were less than those of my neighbour who happened to work for a larger firm, I should certainly feel disgruntled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I go further. If it is the Government's intention to encourage people to work for small firms and to encourage the growth of small firms, they are going about it in a most extraordinary way. If the clause were passed and I were undecided as to whether to work for a small firm or a large firm, if I had the choice, I should obviously prefer to work for a large firm. It is quite extraordinary that the Government should seek to discriminate against the employees of small firms in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause contains the phrase
	<br><q><p>"including the size and administrative resources of the employer's undertaking".</p></q>
What on earth does "administrative resources" mean? I can foresee endless disputes over that, with endless difficulties of emphasis from one tribunal to another. There will be a new legal phrase in the textbooks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson), who is a highly experienced lawyer, asks rhetorically what is meant by the words "administrative resources". I am sure that he has appeared before industrial tribunals. He must be familiar with the fact, for example, that the electricity board or one of the large joint stock banks has available to it administrative resources and personnel departments on a scale and of a size wholly different from those of a greengrocer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What has that to do with it? How does one apply that to unfair dismissal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By applying the test of reasonableness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not doubt for one moment that the Central Electricity Generating Board knows perfectly well what "administrative resources" means. I am not at all sure that the greengrocer to whom the hon. Gentleman referred will know. I am quite sure that if I were an employee of a small firm, or even of a large firm, I would not know what it meant. Moreover, I am certain that there will be a great deal of legal argument over exactly what that phrase means, given the difficult situation that the tribunal will have to face.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0836">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>623</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly confused by this as well. I had rather assumed that "administrative resources" included financial resources. I did not see how the two could be divorced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) threw considerable doubt on that interpretation in my mind. I do not know whether my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) can give us a view based on his legal expertise about whether administrative and financial resources can be divorced when making the test of reasonableness which it has been suggested should be the yardstick.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am no expert in the matter. But I should have thought that the financial resources would be considered to be part of the administrative resources. However, I may be wrong. Perhaps when the hon. and learned Gentleman replies all will become abundantly clear. I have doubts about that, but that is no reflection on the hon. and learned Gentleman. This is his golden hour. He now has to justify a measure that seems to go completely against the arguments of natural justice that he has used hitherto.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Giles Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if I might pick the brains of my hon. and learned Friend even further, as we have his experience and advice to call upon. Am I right in saying that the custom of industrial tribunals and the employment appeal tribunal is that as a rule-of-thumb the smallness of firms is in fact taken into account? A tribunal would not necessarily expect a small firm to carry out exactly the same strict procedures that a big firm would be able to comply with. Tribunals may take a lenient view. It is a question of presentation. They accept that the presentation of a small firm may not be quite as good as that of a large firm. If that is the case, I should have thought that the argument for legislation fell down completely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I am anxious to find out exactly what justification the Under-Secretary will put forward. I should like to know his reason for including this extraordinary phrase in what is already an extraordinary clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be able to help my hon. Friend find an answer to the dilemma. "Administrative resources" pre-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>624</span>
sumably means mainly people. It is, after all, people who administer. It may well be that what the Government mean here is the size and expertise of the staff. A company that can be shown to have people who are not very clever carrying out its administration will therefore be in a different position from one that employs good administrators. That seems to me as good an answer as any that we have been offered so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may well be an invitation to the unscrupulous employer to ensure that his administrative resources are appalling. If I wished to take advantage of the clause and to dismiss my employees without having to pay compensation, I should make sure that I got my administration into an awful muddle. For example, I should employ a bad company secretary—or buy a bad computer, for that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have used the phrase so often, but I really believe that the hon. and learned Gentleman is opening a little minefield with the clause—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A quagmire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not go so far as to say "quagmire". A minefield will door a mini-quagmire. The hon. and learned Gentleman must think about it all again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow is right. I represent a constituency with a large number of small businesses. The constituency depends on small firms. When I meet the people involved in those, I ask them what their problems are. The first problem they mention is VAT. Firms in my constituency have almost gone out of business, not because of the Labour Government's unfair dismissal provisions but because of increased VAT and the high minimum lending rate. Those are the most severe problems that they now face. If the Government really wanted to do something to help small businesses, they would tackle those two aspects of their policy before even considering tinkering about in this absurd fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were a small employer, of course I should not like the consequences of employment legislation. I do not blame employers for that. It is a nuisance having to consult, to fill in forms and to go through the rigmaroles and procedures that legislation frequently entails. I do not blame any employer for preferring not to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0837">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>625</span>
have legislation. This is particularly true of good employers—those who treat their employees fairly and do not need the legislation. I do not blame any such employer for preferring not to have to cope with legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it is a different matter to put employees working for small firms on a different footing with regard to their legal entitlements from those working for a large firm. I should be most interested to hear what possible justification the hon. and learned Gentleman will put forward in defence of the measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Madel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I had to go out three-quarters of the way through the speech of the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant). But he produced a mass of evidence against making the alteration to the 1978 Act, and wondered whether there was any evidence from employers that could be put up against his argument. I therefore slipped out of the room in order to add to the debate by making one or two brief extracts from the Thirteenth Report from the Expenditure Committee for 1977–78—"People and Work: Prospects for Jobs and Training", Volume 1. The Chairman of that subcommittee was the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mrs. Short), a member of the Party in Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After making widespread visits—to Merseyside, Wales, Lincolnshire, and all over London, including Tower Hamlets, we came to some conclusions about the Employment Protection Act. I add to the debate what we said about that Act in paragraph 193, on page 48 of the report:
	<br><q><p>"A number of witnesses considered that the Employment Protection Act deters employers, particularly small firms, from taking on staff. One has the view that the various Employment Acts make firms more reluctant to take on more young people than they are absolutely sure they are going to continue to want in long-term employment'…Representatives of the Institute of Careers Officers added; it is certainly the belief of Careers Officers that smaller employers in particular are now less inclined to take those who cannot show a proved record of employment."</p></q>
We also heard numerous complaints in off-the-record conversations about the deterrent effects of the Employment Protection Act. I do not wish to read the whole report. But at the end we find this:
	<br><q><p>"The authors"—</p></q>
who included members of the Labour Party—
	<br><q><p>"do say that the unfair dismissal clauses of the EPA may have led firms to take longer to fill
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>626</span>

Recommendation No. 196, on page 50, says:
	<br><q><p>"Continuing efforts should be made to ascertain whether or to what extent the Employment Protection Act is deterring small business men from taking on additional personnel"</p></q>
Then the Committee endorses the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham):
	<br><q><p>"Greater efforts should also be made to explain the workings of the Act to small business men"</p></q>
I add those points to the debate because it has been said so far that there is no evidence to show that the provision deters small business men. An all-party committee found in numerous off-the-record conversations and informal evidence taken from all over the country that it did do that. There is more than enough in our findings to justify the Government's action—not in wiping the provision off the statute book, but in making an alteration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

which I referred to? They were independent surveys, commissioned by the department and published by the Government, which came to a somewhat different conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Madel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can survey and survey, but the point is they were not able to survey to the extent that we did. There is evidence which is a counterweight. We must proceed with this Bill.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman leaves the report of the Expenditure Committee, will he tell us whether it also examined all the other so-called deterrents to employment? If the Sub-Committee looked only at employment protection, why was that so? The hon.

What were all the other deterrents that the Sub-Committee found?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Madel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give the hon. Gentleman one deterrent, though we found a lot of others. Erratic incomes policies pursued by the Labour Government was one deterrent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel some compulsion to take part in this debate since I had some responsibility at the Department of Employment over a long period for some of the matters that we are now discussing. The lament about the burden of employment legislation on firms, particularly small firms, is a hardy annual. Curiously enough, almost 12 months ago—24 February 1979—we had a whole day's debate in the House on a Private Member's Bill, and almost exactly a year before that we had a whole day's debate on the subject. We ran over much the same ground that we are covering today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I first draw attention to the fact that the Government's proposals embodied in the clause, with one exception, take us back exactly to what was contained in the infamous Industrial Relations Act. The clock is being turned back to the provisions of that. Act. The Bill recreates what was specifically kicked out by Parliament. But
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>628</span>
the position is even worse, because we now have the addition of the new phrase included in parentheses which our amendment seeks to exclude. To that extent, the position is worse than under the 1971 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In getting immersed in the technicalities of the legislation, we tend to overlook the realities. I quote from the Donovan report. Donovan was considering the necessity for introducing statutory provisions to deal with unfair dismissals, and pointed out that
	<br><q><p>"In reality people build much of their lives around their jobs. Their incomes and prospects for the future are inevitably founded in the expectation that their jobs will continue. For workers in many situations dismissal is a disaster. For some workers it may make inevitable the breaking up of a community and the uprooting of homes and families. Others, and particularly older workers, may be faced with the greatest difficulty in getting work at all."</p></q>
I am not sure how it can be argued that the consequences that may face some workers as a result of being dismissed can somehow vary from one work situation to another. Surely, common suffering demands a common remedy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate is being conducted on the assumption that the words in parentheses
	<br><q><p>"the size and administrative resources of the employer's undertaking"</p></q>
are specifically aimed at allowing the tribunal to give some extra special dispensation to small firms. I am prepared to accept that that is the Government's intention, but that is not what the Bill says. The Bill actually refers to
	<br><q><p>"the size and administrative resources of the employer's undertaking"</p></q>
without any qualification applying it to small firms. The clause applies equally to the back-street bucket shop and the ICIs, the Essos and the multinationals of this world, and to all those in between.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall come later to the small firms argument, but we must not lose sight of the fact that the tribunal will be required to apply that new condition in every case before it, irrespective of the size of the firm. The tribunal will have to make comparisons between the great giants employing hundreds of thousands of people, those employing tens of thousands of people, those employing hundreds of people, and those employing tens or perhaps single figures. We must not lose sight of what the Bill actually says and the consequences of allowing it to pass into law, irrespective of what the understanding might be in the Committee.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>629</span>
I turn to the point raised by the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Madel). In response to a Select Committee request, the Labour Government commissioned a research. A Committee of the House cannot say that there ought to be further research into a matter and, when the further research has been carried out, dismiss it as of no consequence. That research was not carried out by the Department of Employment. The Labour Government might have been accused of bias in wanting to defend our own legislation. We commissioned highly reputable independent bodies to carry out the research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this case we commissioned the Opinion Research Centre to investigate the effects of employment legislation on small firms employing fewer than 50 people. As my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) reminded me, only 2 per cent. of the employers interviewed said that employment legislation was the main difficulty in running their businesses. We have already had reference to the kind of things that they said were their primary problems. One of the questions asked by the Opinion Research Centre, an independent body, was:
	<br><q><p>"What would you say have been the main difficulties you have faced in the past year in running your business?"</p></q>
This was in 1978. Twenty per cent. of the respondents said lack of money. Seven per cent. said VAT—that was when VAT was 81 per cent. Lack of money came first, when the interest rate was 7 per cent. High running costs—electricity, rent, and so on—was also cited. Inflation was given as a reason, when in 1978 it was half the present rate. Way down the list, only 2 per cent. of the respondents gave employment legislation as a reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Respondents were then invited to list all the main difficulties they faced. They mentioned 597 problems. But employment legislation was mentioned by only 6 per cent. of respondents, ranking equal twelfth in the list. Forty-four per cent. mentioned financial problems. Thirty-five per cent. referred to labour problems, for example, staff, and 4 per cent. of the smaller firms mentioned employment legislation compared with 9 per cent. of the larger firms. Here again, employment legislation was way down the list, and at the top of the list was lack of money, at 31 per cent. VAT was 16 per cent. Lack of orders and business was 21 per cent. and inflation 9 per cent., and so it continues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>630</span>
7 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next stage was to ask specifically whether Government measures had helped, or caused difficulties. Those most frequently mentioned were VAT, 22 per cent., regulations such as drivers' log books and, EEC regulations, etc., 9 per cent., other taxation problems 7 per cent., national insurance contributions 6 per cent. and, way down the list, unfair dismissal claims 4 per cent. I could continue. I invite the hon. and learned Gentleman to read the report carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my right hon. Friend agree that if the survey of small businesses was conducted now and they were asked what their greatest problem was, the answer would undoubtedly be 100 per cent. this damn' Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed, but I do not wish to hypothesise about that. I s ay only that all the events subsequent to the carrying out of that research lead one to no other conclusion than that the problems that face them are larger than have been realised. There is lack of money intensified by the very sharp increase in interest rates, there are the problems of electricity costs and so on, intensified by the fuel increases; and there are the problems of VAT intensified by increases in that tax. What can have happened to make them feel differently now from how they felt then about the unfair dismissal legislation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bedfordshire, South and the hon. Member for Chippenham said quite rightly that one of the problems was a lack of communication and understanding. I was always prepared to accept that. There are difficulties in getting across to employers. I am entitled to remind the Conservative Party that there have been unfair dismissal provisions since 1971. All this talk about the Employment Protection Act, as though the provisions were introduced only in 1975, is nonsense. They were introduced in 1971. We have had nine years in which to get the message across and grapple with all the problems, and small business men as well as others have had nine years to acquire an understanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that those hon. Members have taken the trouble to look at the pamphlets that were produced by the thousand. They were given away free by the Department of Employment. When I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0840">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>631</span>
was in the Department we made an effort, but perhaps more ought to be done. But that does not make out a case for the need to change legislation in the discriminatory and unfair way that is now proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the point about getting information across to employers, may I draw the attention of my right hon. Friend to the report that I referred to earlier from the Social Science Research Council at the University of Warwick? It points out that ACAS has been taking an increasing role in publicity, education, advice and guidance aimed at the small employer. It gives the following figures. In 1978, 23 per cent. of ACAS's survey and advisory projects related to legislation on the rights of the individual employee and discrimination in employment, and that 64 per cent. of the ACAS advisory projects concerned firms employing fewer than 300 people. It points out that a number of conferences that were aimed at the small employer were held.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Likewise, my right hon. Friend will know that as regards the wages council—and there is a problem for small employers—the Department of Employment was doing more than ever before to get across the difficulties for employers and employees in understanding some of that complex legislation. There were leaflets and a national advertising campaign, and many of those things are now in jeopardy because of the Government's public expenditure cuts. But I am sure we would all agree that the aims were desirable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what my hon. Friend said. I merely add that in the last few years, in a period when there have been significant and overdue changes in many cases in the whole area of employment legislation, an enormous conference industry has been spawned. I sometimes felt, after the invitations I received to address seminars, conferences and the like, that either we had given birth to a new industry and a job creation scheme, or that many firms would have gone out of business had it not been for the legislation introduced by the House and the need to explain it. We went through an enormous education process that my hon. Friend and I have described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make a final point, which I also made on Second Reading. How on earth the hon. and learned Gentleman can, at the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>632</span>
end of what is a most blantantly discriminatory new provision, make the statement that the question before the tribunal should be determined in accordance with equity and the substantial merits of the case, I do not know. Unless I misunderstand, the new provision is a denial of equity and of an argument and a decision that are based upon the merits of the case. It is based wholly upon this discriminatory provision that relates to the size of the resources and the undertaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have the feeling that it would not be a bad idea if we reminded ourselves of what the relevant section of the 1978 Act says and what it would say if the clause were enacted without the amendment. We are talking about that part of the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 which says what shall be the general provisions relating to fairness of dismissal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 57(3)—which I will paraphrase for the sake of brevity—says that where the employer has established that there is a justifiable reason for having dismissed the employee, the determination whether the dismissal was fair or unfair, having regard to the reasons shown by the employer, shall depend on whether the employer can satisfy the tribunal that in the circumstances, having regard to equity and the substantial merits of the case, he acted reasonably in treating it as a sufficient reason for dismissing the employee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 5 of the Bill inserts:
	<br><q><p>"in the circumstances (including the size and administrative resources of the employer's undertaking) the employer acted reasonably or unreasonably in treating it as a sufficient reason for dismissing the employee; and that question shall be determined in accordance with equity and the substantial merits of the case"</p></q>
I believe that this has been lost sight of, no doubt inadvertently, in the course of an interesting and protracted debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides that the circumstances shall be considered to see whether the employer has acted reasonably in treating the statutory justifiable reason for dismissal as a ground in this case for dismissing the employee. We are now saying that those circumstances should include the size and administrative resources of the employer's undertaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first point that I should like to make is that this does not empower tribunals to do something that most of them do not at present do. They are all empowered to do it, and some do. The question then is,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0841">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>633</span>
why go to the trouble of putting this into the Bill? So I will provide an answer. Although the employment tribunals are empowered to do this, they are not all seen to do it, nor is it apparent to many people who are not lawyers or substantial business men, but perhaps small businessmen. It is not apparent to them either that they are empowered to do it. Regrettably, there are a few examples where they do not seem to do it. It is because it is not widely or generally understood, particularly amongst the smaller businesses, that there is this power, amongst all the circumstances that have to be regarded by the statute to take into account the size and administrative resources, that the Government believe that it should be spelt out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge at once that what I say may be argued to be in conflict with the view that I have taken on earlier amendments. But there is a distinction in that one can see a perceived defect. We know that the law permits them to take into account the size and administrative resources of the businesses. However, we also know—and I refer to what my hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Madel) said, and as the House of Commons has discovered through one of its Select Committees there is a significant number of business men who do not believe that is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When there is a perceived defect which calls for a specific inclusion of a specific identification of one of a general category, that is a legitimate reason for expressly incorporating it in legislation. But when there is no perception of a defect or deficiency, that is bad legislative practice. That is the distinction which I make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman explain what he means by "administrative resources"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that anyone with business experience—certainly anybody who sits on an industrial tribunal—will have any difficulty in deciding what may be properly described as an administrative resource. It is a great mistake to take a simple word of the English language and to use a less simple one to explain it. The whole point of industrial tribunals is that they used their common sense and everyday experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have to go on to justify the Government's assertion that there is a significant failure to understand the law and practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>634</span>
I am grateful for what my hon. Friend said, because it provided from an unimpeachable source absolute and categorical evidence that was called for, and the existence of which was denied, for the foundation of the Government's argument. I could rest my case on that by itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I wish to deal with the survey that was commissioned by my Department and to which the right hon. Gentleman has referred—that is, the Opinion Research Centre survey. That was a poll of 301 firms which employed fewer than 50 people. It was not one of those surveys in which only 2 per cent. replied. We all know that one cannot place much reliance on their results. Each of the people that had been selected was interviewed, so it was a 100 per cent. poll. Of those, 24 per cent. said that they would have taken on more employees but for the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that the same survey?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the same one—the Opinion Research Centre survey that was sponsored by the Department of Employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it was a thorough poll, various questions were asked in differing order. But one question received an answer from 24 per cent. of the respondents that they would have taken on more employees but for the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may be regarded as insignificant, but I contend that it is not because there are between 3 million and 3½ million employed by small firms with staffs of 25 or fewer. If only 12 per cent.—let alone 24 per cent.—of such employers regard the present employment legislation as putting up a barrier to their taking on more people, its removal could lead to higher unemployment. I believe that to be important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The numbers that the hon. and learned Gentleman cited were connected with the employment protection legislation. To which part of that was he referring?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always a good precept to go to one's sources. Towards the end of the questionnaire, respondents were asked whether they would have employed more people had it not been for the employment protection legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which part?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Please allow me to continue. I have listened with interest and admiration to many speeches and I am trying to answer the points that were put. In answer to that question 17—that is, 6 per cent.—replied "a lot more" and 5418 per cent.—replied "a few more". That makes 24 per cent. who said that they would have employed more people but for the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the survey people were asked about employment protection legislation.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am equally sure that it is not in order, Mr. Leadbitter, for a Minister to mislead the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chair has not perceived any statement for it to believe that there has been any misleading of the Committee.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot see how I can be said to be misleading the Committee when I cite the report, which states that near the end of the questionnaire respondents were asked whether they would have employed more people had it not been for the employment protection legislation.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was with prompting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>636</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall turn to the point put by the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Members of the Committee must know that there is plenty of time for them to have the Floor. It would be right for us to hear what the Minister has to say. Other hon Gentlemen will have their opportunity later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opinion Research Centre survey has been held up to us by the right hon. Gentleman as being a pure source of information on the subject, as one would hope because it was sponsored by the Department over which he presided. I heard the hon. Member for Islington, Central say that the survey prompted that answer. That is an extraordinary attempt to denigrate the validity of such a survey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not deny that there are in other parts of that poll those questions and answers to which the right hon. Gentleman referred. But as it has been held up to us as somehow knocking the bottom out of the Government's whole case, I am entitled to remind the Committee that the question was asked and the answer was obtained from that proportion of the respondents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has taken a selective answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that I have taken a selective answer. I do not rely on the Opinion Research Centre as my sole justification, but on what I learn from my constituents and on what the Select Committee found out from those to whom it spoke in the course of a year's research. I am absolutely confident that the majority of people in this country who have given any attention to the matter would recognise that the part of the Employment Protection Act legislation which bears most hardly upon the ability of the smaller firms to employ more people is that dealing with unfair dismissal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause says that one must take account of the
	<br><q><p>"size and the administrative resources"</p></q>
of an undertaking amongst all the other circumstances. The tribunals already do that because if one is talking about redundancy, for example, as one of the justifiable statutory reasons for dismissal—and there are four set out in the Act, as we know—the size of the undertaking has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0843">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>637</span>
a bearing on that. If one has a very small firm and its turnover or profitability declines, it may well be reasonable to make somebody redundant because one cannot carry excess labour for more than a short time. If one has a big firm, it is less reasonable to make somebody redundant straight away. I give that simply as an illustration of a practical event that would make it proper for the tribunal to have regard to size.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Administrative resources are another factor. We are not creating separate classes of employees. There are, indeed, two classes of able-bodied people in this country. One class is composed of those who have jobs and the other of those who do not and would like them. It is the policy of this Government to increase the first class and to diminish the second, instead of allowing the second class to double as it did under the Labour Administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, we face many obstacles that we inherited, including an enormous national overdraft, but that does not preclude us from doing what we can to spell out in the law that the tribunals are reasonable in the standards that they apply and are realistic and understanding. That is all that the clause does, and that is not creating two classes. There are other proposals to which we shall come later where that charge could be made with a little more validity, although I shall reject it when we come to it, and I shall have no difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Right hon. and hon. Gentlemen would have a slightly less embarrassing case to make later in the Bill, but on this it simply falls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman dropped a danger there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, no. I believe in facing reality. I can see that it will be slightly easier to sustain the charge that I am now meeting later on under the maternity provisions than on the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I go back to what the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow said in one of his many entertaining interventions. He said that we have to order our affairs having regard to people as they are. That is the justification for the clause. People as they are not people as they ought to be, not business men as well informed as they ought to be but people, including those in small businesses, as they are. They do not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>638</span>
know what the tribunals mostly do or what they should do, and all we say is that we should face that fact and try to correct it. I inform the Committee that the Government are proposing to publish further guidance to businesses about the workings of the Act. There is a big task to be completed. The last Administration started on it, but there is more to be done; we are alive to that and will take up the challenge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Right hon. and hon. Gentlemen have said that small businesses are concerned about the minimum lending rate, and of course they are. They are concerned about VAT, and the gross overspending that this country was led into by the Labour Government. But because we cannot immediately rectify those matters, the argument seems to be that we should not even set about trying to rectify anything that we can put right. That is a recipe for despair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, having listened to the debate for a long time and having done my best to achieve consensus, I must advise my hon. Friends to resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman will not encourage any consensus or co-operation by misleading the Committee with selective quotations of the sort he made. I am aware that he may accuse me of selective quotation, but if I selected pieces it would be only to save the time of the Committee. If I am to be charged with that in future, when I have to quote from a document such as this, perhaps, in the interests of the Committee and of accuracy, I should quote the whole document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I shall not now inflict that on the Committee. I merely say that the point at which I sought to challenge the hon. and learned Gentleman when he quoted from the report—I assume that we are both looking at the same report since mine was issued by the Department of Employment—the full paragraph, not half of it, would have read as follows:
	<br><q><p>"Near the end of the interview respondents were asked directly if they would have employed more people but for the employment legislation. Seventeen (6 per cent.) replied 'a lot more' and fifty-four (18 per cent.) replied 'a few more', making seventy-one in all. Seventy-six per cent. said it made no difference."</p></q>
At that point the hon. and learned Gentleman stopped and could not be persuaded

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>639</span>
to go further. However, the document continues:
	<br><q><p>"These figures need to be compared with the replies of the same employers to other questions"</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A different document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. and learned Gentleman does not have the right document, I apologise and withdraw the charge. I was reading from the document published by the Department of Employment on 17th August 1978. Perhaps now, because the hon. and learned Gentleman has not been reading the right document and now has this information, he may wish to think again about the strength of his remarks in the light of what I am about to tell him and the Committee. The document said that of the 71 employers who made up the 24 per cent. to which the hon. and learned Gentleman referred:
	<br><q><p>"14 of the 71 had said that no particular Government measures caused them difficulty. 29 of the 71 had indicated that no employment legislation provisions were affecting their business. 56 of the 71 did not find any particular piece of employment legislation troublesome when given a specific list, which included unfair dismissal"</p></q>
I am glad that the hon. and learned Gentleman has told us that he was unaware of that and had been reading a different document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am referring to the report and it is from that that I read. I believe that what the right hon. Gentleman referred to is a summary of the report that was prepared, perfectly properly, by the Department of Employment. Those are the two documents at which we are looking. I do not challenge whatever—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman had better not challenge me. He seems to be suggesting that somehow the Department of Employment put into the document in my possession something that was never in the report, and I am sure that that never happened. This was the document to which Ministers referred in the House and outside, and it has been treated as the authoritative statement of the Opinion Research Centre study. If I have done the hon. and learned Gentle-man an injustice, I readily withdraw and apologise, and if it was the case that he had not seen the—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>640</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman says "No". Either he has seen the figures or he has not. I hope that he is not suggesting that I or the Department have made them up or that this is a cooked-up piece of paper. I am telling the hon. and learned Gentleman, as the Minister responsible at the time, that these were the figures that were published on behalf of the Department and that they have never been challenged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since the right hon. Gentleman is getting himself into such a great state of excitement, please allow me, Mr. Leadbitter, to repeat what I have already said. I do not doubt, and have never doubted, that those extracts which the right hon. Gentleman took were to be found in the document and he was entitled to select and use them. By the same token, I was entitled to rely on the passage in the report in which of those who were asked the question whether the employment legislation had led to their employing fewer people or whether they would have employed more people but for the employment legislation, 24 per cent. said that they would. Six per cent. said that they would have employed "a lot more" and 18 per cent. replied "a few more". There is something in this bran-tub for everyone—that is what I am saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman now regards it as a bran-tub. What the hon. and learned Gentleman has not said at any time is whether he accepts the figures I quoted. Apparently he had not seen them, otherwise he ought to have quoted them. I now absolve him from my charge of not quoting when he should if he did not have the figures. I think that he has not seen them because he does not have the right documents. I hope that he will accept from me that as the Minister responsible for the publication of the report at the time, the figures I quoted were those that were given publicly on behalf of the Opinion Research Centre both in the House and outside—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] It is no use the hon. and learned Gentleman shaking his head and countering away from the Front Bench as though it is all a conspiracy that I have worked up. Obviously he has not got the report. That is the truth of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In defence of his position the hon. and

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>641</span>
learned Gentleman is trying to use the Opinion Research Centre survey, but clearly he has not even seen it or studied it. He ought to go back and study the right document. If he has not got the right document, he can have it, Let him study it now and come back to the Committee when he has learnt the figures, instead of quoting a half-baked report in defence of his case. I do not think that the Committee need waste its time any more. I think that we ought to vote. In the light of his remarks the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) ought to be putting his vote where his mouth lies, and that is with Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee is ready to come to a conclusion. In any event, we can pursue the matter further on the next amendment, on which there are some cogent points to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take up only a minute and a half to say to the hon. and learned Gentleman that I am not interested in the argument between him and my right hon. Friend about which bits to quote. Whether he is right in quoting the bits he quoted, I am saying that he is drawing the wrong conclusions from the bits he quoted. He is drawing the conclusion from that figure</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>642</span>
	<p>that it justified a change in the law. I want to put to him two reasons why it does not.</p>
	<p>The first reason is that he and his hon. Friends have been telling us that small business men do not know what the legislation is. So what is being said is that 24 per cent. of chaps said "I don't know what the industrial tribunal law is, but I'm prepared to say that if it wasn't there, whatever it may be, I would take on more people" He cannot rest a case on that.</p>
	<p>The second point I want to put to the hon. and learned Gentleman is what sort of figures would we have got if, in addition to the question that was asked, I had asked "If you did not have to pay VAT, would you take on more employees?", or "If you did not have to pay rent, would you take on more employees?" Since they would give positive answers to that, would he then draw the conclusion that we should relieve these businesses from paying VAT and from paying rent? That is the thinnest case I have heard the hon. and learned Gentleman put at any stage in this Committee. It is a very thin case indeed.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
