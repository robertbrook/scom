	<section>
	<div class='title'>PROHIBITION ON ABUSE OF INFORMATION OBTAINED IN OFFICIAL CAPACITY</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"(1) This section applies to any information which—
	<ol>
	<li>is held by a Crown servant or former Crown servant by virtue of his position or former position as a Crown servant or is knowingly obtained by an individual (directly or indirectly) from a Crown servant or former Crown servant who he knows or has reasonable cause to believe held the information by virtue of any such position;</li>

	<p>(3) An individual to whom this section applies—
	<ol>
	<li>shall not deal on a recognised stock exchange in any relevant securities;</li>
	<li>shall not counsel or procure any other person to deal on a recognised stock exchange in any such securities; and</li>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause lays down similar prohibitions and exceptions to those contained in new clause 42, but in relation to Crown servants. The sort of information which would prevent Crown servants dealing is the same as for insiders, in that it is information acquired by virtue of the Crown servant's position, which it would be reasonable to expect him to hold in confidence and which he knows is unpublished price sensitive information, as defined in new clause 46. The prohibitions also extend to people who knowingly receive such information from Crown servants if they know that it is unpublished price sensitive information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will ensure that the wide range of commercially sensitive information which Crown servants are likely to receive will not be made use of for personal gain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have one question to ask. I know we have a definition of "Crown servant" later on, but is there any gap between the Crown servant which means an individual who holds office under or is employed by the Crown and the employee of a nationalised industry, which is a statutory corporation? Is the statutory corporation included in "a company" and, therefore, all the rest of the clauses apply without having to seek the aid of clause 43, or should we add some longer definition of "company" to ensure that it includes statutory corporations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Trade (Mr. Cecil Parkinson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee for being late. We have had a deputation from Oldham on the very urgent problems of the textile industry, and that is why I was not here when the Committee proceedings began.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend asked whether this includes employees of nationalised industries. The answer is that it does not; neither employees of local authorities nor employees of nationalised industries are caught by this section. Of course,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>604</span>
my right hon. Friend is on to a point which may become more significant as we start to kit out some of those nationalised industries with share capital. At the moment, many of them are statutory corporations, but the answer to his question is that at the moment they do not fall within this definition. Whether there is a problem there or not, I should like to consider. Once again my right hon. Friend has pointed to an interesting thought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting that local authority employees are left out of this altogether. If it is necessary to have a special clause about Crown servants, it might well be that one ought to consider local authority servants, because undoubtedly they receive information which might be inside information—over for example, planning applications—and might affect a company very considerably, if that local authority servant happened to be connected in some way with the company making a planning application. I merely use that as an example which comes to mind. I cannot see why one has to have a special clause about Crown servants, and leave out others who may have a similar type of information which might be damaging.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I just repeat what I said? This is an important point. We would like to consider it now. Certainly, if the clause does not work satisfactorily and the sort of problems to which my right hon. Friend points emerge, action would be called for. We should like, however, to consider what he had to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<ol>
	<li>through an off-market dealer acting in the course of his business, in the knowledge that he is an off-market dealer and the securities are advertised securities; or</li>
	<li>as an off-market dealer acting in the course of his business or as an officer, employee or agent of such a dealer acting in the course of the dealer's business;</li></ol>
	<li>counselling or procuring a person so to deal in advertised securitics;</li>
	<li>communicating any information in the knowledge or belief that it will be used for dealing as aforesaid or counseling or procuring a person so to deal,</li></ol>
as they apply in relation to dealing in securities on a recognised stock exchange, to counselling or procuring a person so to deal and to communicating any information in the knowledge or belief that it will be used for such dealing or counselling or procuring.</p>
	<p>(2) In this section—
	<br><blockquote><p>"advertised securities" in relation to a particular occurrence, means listed securities or securities in respect of which, not more than six months before that occurrence, information indicating the prices at which persons have dealt or were willing to deal in those securities has been published for the purpose of facilitating deals in those securities;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"off-market dealer" means a person who—

	<li>is a member of a recognised association of dealers in securities within the meaning of that Act; or</li>
	<li>is an exempted dealer within the meaning of that Act.</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>(3) For the purposes of this section an off-market dealer shall be taken to deal in advertised securities if he deals in such securities or acts as an intermediary in connection with deals made by other persons in such securities; and references in this section to such a dealer's officer, employee or agent dealing in such securities shall be construed accordingly.</p>
	<p>(4) For those purposes an individual shall be taken to deal through an off-market dealer if the latter is a party to the transaction, is an agent for either party to the transaction or is acting as an intermediary in connection with the transaction.".—[	<i>Mr. Parkinson.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause he read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I explained in my opening remarks on new clause 42, we did not find the clause in the previous Bill, on the transactions other than those on the Stock Exchange, satisfactory. We believe that what is important is to extend the provisions to cover similar markets to the Stock Exchange. We wish to apply the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>606</span>
same provisions to other markets as we apply to the Stock Exchange in the various clauses of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Off-market dealers are defined by reference to those who are authorised for the purposes of the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act 1958. The detailed provisions are set out in subsection (2). The provisions do not apply to all deals conducted by or through such dealers, but only those in advertised securities. This means listed securities and securities with, in effect. a published price. This is the effect of the definition in subsection (2). It is necessary, we believe, to impose a cut-off point to ensure that shares which once had a published price and were dealt with in a more general market are excluded if they have not been dealt in recently, and this is the purpose of the six-month period in the definition of "advertised securities".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsections (3) and (4) serve to define when a person deals through an off-market dealer and when, indeed, an off-market dealer himself deals. This ties in with the prohibitions in subsection (1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be noted that subsection (1) has been redrafted to make its effect absolutely clear with regard to the secondary offences of counselling, procuring and so on. As drafted in the consultative document, there was some danger that it would not be appreciated that these offences were picked up, as indeed they were intended to be, by the final four lines of subsection (1) of clause (C) in the consultative document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope I can keep in order in referring to this, but I want to refer to something which is not in the clause. The clause deals purely and simply, as I understand it, with off-market deals where a dealer is concerned. That means that we have left out of the Bill altogether the private dealings. In the 1978 Bill of the then Government there was a clause to deal with private dealings, in which it was provided that the person who had inside information should disclose that information when he was having a private deal with some other person. I suppose that is so in ordinary common law or in contract law—that one should disclose to the person with whom one is contracting information that may affect the mind of that person with whom one is contracting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0333">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>607</span>
There may be a moral obligation, but I am not sure whether there is any legal obligation to do this, provided there is not misrepresentation. Of course, one comes very near to misrepresentation if one has inside information and does not disclose it to the person with whom one is contracting, but it might be difficult to show that there was misrepresentation involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not necessarily pleading for a clause about dealing, but I do have difficulty in justifying any distinction between the terms of the clause which we are now considering and a clause about private dealings. If there is a breach of confidence, it can be just as much a breach of confidence when there is a transaction between two private persons as when there is a transaction between a private person and a dealer. I wonder if I am right on this. But I suppose the distinction is that the purpose of these insider dealing clauses is to give the public confidence in our method of quoting the price of shares, whether it is in listed prices or in any other advertised prices of shares. Nobody can have confidence in that if they are not assured that there is not someone with inside information who is rigging the market in some way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may be the real reason why we do not deal with private dealings in the Bill. We deal only with those dealings which have effect, or could have effect, on the listed or advertised prices of shares. But it is difficult to try to find some distinction, such as I have in those few words, between dealer dealings and private dealings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again my right hon. Friend pinpoints a very difficult area in the Bill—an area to which we again gave very careful consideration. In the last Bill, as he said, there were provisions to deal with face-to-face transactions and dealings in unlisted securities. What we have done in this Bill, I would suggest, is to widen the provisions for off-market dealings in new clause 44, but it is true that we have excluded face-to-face dealings where advertised securities are not involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were a number of motives for this. I will perhaps not call them reasons. We believe that in such face-to-face transactions people know with whom they are dealing and should be capable
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>608</span>
of making enquiries and satisfying themselves about from whom they are buying. If I am dealing with my right hon. Friend and I am going to buy something from him and it is a transaction between him and me, I would suggest that it is in both our interests to find out about each other before we do the deal, me about him as a potential vendor and him about me as to whether my cheque will bounce. There is much more opportunity in face-to-face transactions for the parties actually to satisfy themselves about the bona fides of the people with whom they are dealing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We felt that the provision in the previous Bill may have looked as though it dealt with the problem, but one simply had to say "By the way, I am an insider" and, as I understand it, one was totally in the clear. If a person is so innocent that he is not likely to be put on proper notice by the magic words "By the way, I am an insider", can it then be said that one would be absolutely in the clear to run that person ragged once those words were used? If it were an elderly or rather naive person with whom one was dealing, the words would not mean a thing to him and one could carry on robbing him in the full knowledge that one was protected because one had used the form of words, which probably meant nothing to him.

On the whole, we came to the conclusion that it promised more than it delivered, and we decided that the Bill would be better off without it. The extended provisions of new clause 44 would cover some of the worst cases. We hope that, from place to place, people will feel that they must look after themselves and take professional advice. At least, they would know with whom they were dealing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find the Minister's argument far less convincing than his usual line of argument. It is one thing to say that the clause which was incorporated in the Labour Government's Bill is unsatisfactory, but quite another to say that we are unconvinced that there is any need. It would have been possible for the Government to have applied clause 59. They have done that in other respects, and I make no complaint about it. The longer one thinks about all these company law

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>609</span>
recommendations the more likely it is that one will want to refine them. I dare say that, even now, we do not have completely the right answer in perfect practice, as was conceded by the Under-Secretary the other day. But what the Minister is now asserting is alien to the basic propositions that he argued this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) said that the common law situation would appear not to provide a remedy. He expressed uncharacteristic uncertainty about the law, because I have a high regard for his legal ability. It seems to me that the position was disposed of in the case of Percival v. Wright in 1902, where the learned judge, Mr. Justice Swinfen Eady, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is urged"—</p></blockquote>
that is, on behalf of the plaintiff—
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the directors hold a fiduciary position as trustees for the individual shareholders, and that where negotiations for sale of the undertaking are on foot, they are in the position of trustees for sale. … I am therefore of opinion that the purchasing directors were under no obligation to disclose to their vendor shareholders the negotiations which ultimately proved abortive."</p></blockquote>
So what he found was that the fiduciary relationship did not extend to a director who is in a purchase and sale of securities relationship with a shareholder. I think that the common law arrived at a disastrous cul-de-sac at that point in 1902, and we have had plenty of time to think about it since then. It is right that this situation should have been reversed legislatively, which is what we propose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister ought to think about this afresh. As he said this morning, he did not come here with a closed mind. I therefore hope that that is the situation. The right hon. Member for Crosby is perhaps a little less dogmatic than I have been, but we have both raised a formidable point. I hope that the Government's response will not be a blank negative at this stage. If it is, we shall most certainly come back to it on Report, because we think that the Government's exclusion of the principle set out in clause 59 is misconceived. What we expect from the Minister is a more careful exposé of the Government's position on the matter than he has hitherto given to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having regard to what the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>610</span>
Member said this morning in a very persuasive speech, that he is now saying that the doctrine caveat emptor should apply is most unsatisfactory. All I am asking him is not to make up his mind finally about it this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have seldom been invited to make a more easy commitment. I find it difficult at the best of times to make up my mind finally about most things. I am quite happy to say to the hon. Gentleman at the very beginning that I recognise the force of his argument, although he will not be surprised to hear that I did not find his speech on this occasion as persuasive as some of those I have heard him make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to clean up and strengthen the markets, to make people who go and deal in quoted securities or securities that are available for dealing on the public market have more confidence in that market. It is in that particular market that the big insiders have operated, and they are the people we are after in our legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken of face-to-face deals, as did my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page). I did one myself recently. I sold my business to a Swiss group of companies. They had to make up their minds about me and my holding, and I made up my mind about whether I would deal with them. I knew who I was dealing with. They had a chance to find out what they could, and whether I was selling the business for good reasons or for bad. I feel that in these off-market face-to-face transactions, where people are dealing with each other, there is much more to be said for the doctrine of caveat emptor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, in a very complex market, in a huge market in shares or in dealings on the Stock Exchange, where one does not know with whom one is dealing, a different set of regulations is necessary. I do not think that there is anything inconsistent in arguing that in face-to-face transactions in private securities people should take advice and find out, coming to their own decisions about whether they deal, and we should have a set of rules governing the much more complex markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made a clear point. We accept his view that this is a complex field. What we thought was that we would start our new legislation
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0335">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>611</span>
in a limited way—though when I say "limited" I recognise that we are talking about the whole of the operations of the quoted securities market. We thought we would start there and, if experience taught us that we needed to move further, then we would.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note what the hon. Gentleman has said and I give him the sincere commitment that we shall consider carefully between now and Report what he and my right hon. Friend have said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause is relatively straightforward in that its actual words spell out very specifically what it is about. It sets out the penalties for contravention of the provisions in new clauses 42, 43 and 44. The maximum penalties set out are imprisonment for two years and an unlimited fine. Given the public concern about insider dealing and the wider interest in demonstrating clearly that we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>612</span>
regard it as improper, as I said this morning, we believe that criminal sanctions are both desirable and sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The panalties imposed under this clause are severe. They are severe be-because we believe that this is a very serious crime and the penalties available to deal with those convicted of it should reflect its importance. The people who involve themselves in insider dealing are in the process of destroying confidence in the market in securities. We believe that to be a very serious offence and that it deserves severe penalties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Stevens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister for Trade put his finger on an important element in what we are discussing today when he said that we were concerned to reassure members of the public. We have already discussed at length the problems that are likely to arise if criminal charges under this Bill are brought, and it may be thought that at this time, when we need the creation of wealth to advance rather more quickly than it has done in the recent past, the laying of more traps for the unwary director and business man—though perhaps with a noble purpose—may be ill-timed. But if we accept my hon. Friend's argument that we are talking about the reassurance of the public, then two points arise on new clause 45 on which I should welcome his views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first relates to the information obtained in an official capacity. I think that we all understand that we are talking only about information relating to the buying and selling of stock. But, of course, from the point of view of public reassurance, the current practice of senior civil servants leaving Government employment and going straight into industry affects a much wider area of anxiety than this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the point covered in subsection (1) be matched by other provisions of control and the laying down of rules—which at the moment are not perhaps always observed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point—we have touched on this point before—is that in order for this clause to work there has to be some hope of the law enforcement agencies—the fraud squad or whoever it may be—being adequate to cope with the new range of criminal offences which we are creating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Notwithstanding that I agree with my
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0336">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>613</span>
hon. Friend the Minister of State in his determination not to set up a special team to seek to enforce these criminal regulations, I am nervous that the existing people working in this field of law enforcement are so far behind with the work they have now that to add further criminal causes will only get them even more behind and bring the law into further contempt, with the opposite effect to the one intended—to wit, far from reassuring the public, we may, because of increasing delays in implementation, add to the anxieties of the public rather than otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We made this morning the general point about compensation and disgorgement, and there is now a particular point on which I would welcome guidance from the Minister. Under subsection (2) proceedings can be instituted only with the leave of the Secretary of State or the Director of Public Prosecutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that there is a contrast between this subsection and that which the Committee has already accepted in new clause 27 in relation to the criminal penalties for contravention of the prohibition on loans to directors. I am not convinced either way as to whether it is necessary, but I should have thought that there was a strong case for saying that in both these new clauses the obligation should be uniform—required in both or not required in both—as to the consent of the Director or the Secretary of State. It is for the Government to say why they can distinguish this new clause from new clause 27 which the Committee has already considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman remind me of the point on new clause 27?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. My point is that in new clause 27—the penalties for contravention of the prohibition of loans to directors—there is no limitation that proceedings can be instituted only by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions or by the Secretary of State. I am arguing that that penalites clause should, in my judgment, be uniform with the present clause, or, if not, the Government need to give a good reason for the difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>614</span>
	<p>5 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow the criticism of subsection (2) made by the hon. Member for Swansea, East (Mr. Anderson), but I criticise it on another ground. I think it wholly wrong for the Secretary of State to decide whether there shall be a prosecution. It is not right that it should be a political decision, and who is the Secretary of State if he is not a political animal? He must make political decisions, and this would be one of them, surely, in deciding whether there should be a prosecution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right person is the AttorneyGeneral—again, a rather peculiar animal, perhaps, in our constitution, but at least always looked on as an independent person when making a decision of this sort. I do not mind whether it is the Attorney-General or the Director of Public Prosecutions, but if one inserts the Attorney-General there one does not need to mention the Director of Public Prosecutions because, in the normal practice, the Attorney-General would take the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions, who would then institute the inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This brings me to the point which we were discussing this morning on investigations. If any hon. Members have had the privilege of seeing reports obtained by the Director of Public Prosecutions from a police investigation, as I have had, they will know what a thorough investigation the police are capable of carrying out even in matters of fraud of this sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens when the Attorney-General's permission is required for a prosecution is that the Attorney-General asks the Director of Public Prosecutions to advise on the case, and the Director, if the statements are not full enough at that stage, will ask the police to set up an inquiry. The police are very capable of doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were told this morning that the police would not do it but the solicitor's branch in the Department of Trade would do it. This strikes me with horror. The hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) made some rather caustic remarks about the solicitor's branch—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I did not make caustic remarks about them. I have the greatest admiration for the staff in that office. I worked closely with them for five years. My criticism was simply that I think that to deal with these matters one requires a new source of expertise, and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0337">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>615</span>
more or less the undivided attention of a group of people. That was the only criticism I made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged for the hon. Gentleman's explanation. Where I disagree with him is in the suggestion that some new body has to be set up, with new expertise. All I meant was that I thought that the solicitor's branch had another job which it does perfectly efficiently, apart from an inquiry into this sort of fraud—because that is what it is—and that the police are quite capable of carrying out these investigations. Let us stay with the ordinary police and not have a sort of private police force from the Department of Trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One small point of drafting on subsection (2) is that it should be only the consent of the Attorney-General that is required. It can be left at that. The Attorney-General will proceed in the normal way, in conjunction with the Director of Public Prosecutions and if an inquiry is necessary, then let the police do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that subsection (2) applies only to proceedings for an offence under this section instituted—that is, the proceedings were instituted; not the offence, I presume—in England and Wales. It might be "England or Wales" perhaps, but why not Scotland? I suppose that will be provided for somewhere else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to subsection (3). This is extremely important, and it is a reversal of the normal law in these matters. What has been spoken about in subsection (1) and (2) is a crime. A crime has been committed. If a contract is brought about by a crime, that contract normally is illegal, unenforceable, invalid, not even just voidable but I should have thought it should be void; except that here we are altering the law and saying that this contract shall not be void, not even "voidable". That too, if I may use the phrase, knocks on the head any question of compensation, because the innocent party who enters into an invalid, illegal contract has—I think I remember from my student days—no claim under that contract. He may have a claim for fraud, being defrauded of his money in some way, but he cannot claim under the contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3), therefore, is putting us into great difficulties. What is, then, the position of an illegal contract such as this? It is not void; it is not voidable. It is indeed validated, despite the crime that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>616</span>
has been committed in entering into it. That really is going to put us in some difficulties in deciding what are the rights between the parties hereafter. It makes it all the more important that we should have some provision in the Bill about the offender disgorging his profits and the victim receiving some compensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Stevens), in his remarks, voiced the anxiety that, because an overworked department might be very slow at dealing with these problems, that might destroy the public's confidence in the market rather than reinforce it. He shares my concern that we wish to see ownership of shares grow, and we wish to see people have confidence in the market. However, I do not believe that there is a gigantic mass of this type of transaction. I believe that insider dealing is a relatively rare business, and, as I said this morning, I do not expect to see hundreds of previously respectable, highly-regarded people dragged before the courts. I think that the people who indulge in this crime—or what will be a crime when we have finished our legislation—are a very small minority and that the number of transactions is relatively few. The people who do this are very skilled already in company frauds. They devote a great deal of their time to inspecting the carcasses of decaying companies, and they are experts and authorities in dealing with these problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will, however, watch that point. I agree with my hon. Friend that, were the result of this to be that insider dealing were dealt with much more slowly than might otherwise have been the case, that would be very unsatisfactory. We will keep a careful eye on that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Swansea, East (Mr. Anderson), asked—the point was taken up by my right hon. Friend—about the institution of proceedings in England and Wales, and the fact that they should not be instituted except by the Secretary of State or by or with consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. This is a very important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would tell my right hon. Friend, first, that the Secretary of State under sections of various other Acts, has the power to institute proceedings. My right hon. Friend has once again chalked up a first, because, so far as my officials are aware, this is the first time anyone has ever asked "why?" or challenged this proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the first time in their hearing and in mine that my right hon. Friend has made that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that point—it is not accurate—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has given way, Sir Stephen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know he has, but he did not give way at first. The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that he must indicate his intention to intervene and then the hon. Member has to sit down. We cannot have two hon. Members on their feet at the same time, even such distinguished Front Benchers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. Flattery will get you everywhere, Sir Stephen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman is right, of course, because this issue was challenged in the Companies Bill, on which the hon. Gentleman served as a Whip, if I recall aright, in 1976. We had some very good arguments for keeping it to the Secretary of State, but, frankly, I cannot remember what they were.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because we had provided for almost every conceivable eventuality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will now explain to my right hon. Friend the purpose of the subsection. The provision has been misunderstood by a number of people. It has been suggested that it is some form of safeguard which will be used to remedy the defects in the draft because by using this discretionary control to prevent prosecutions which could well succeed under the clauses as drafted. But I must stress straightaway that this is not the case. We do not believe that we need to narrow the prohibitions in this way, and I should like to reassure hon. Members who think that that is our motive, because it is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, we think it would be quite wrong to narrow the prohibitions in this way and to use such a device if we did
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>618</span>
believe that they were not right. One of the representations we have received from a member of Lincoln's Inn puts this point extremely well. It pointed out that if it was meant to be a safeguard, this would be, "both perilous and constitutionally unsound"—"Perilous" because it depends on official discretion; "constitutionally unsound" because it is outrageous for the law to say to the citizen: "Do not worry. What you do is criminal but if it is inoffensive you can rely on the Secretary of State and the Director of Public Prosecutions not to prosecute you." I quite agree with that statement, and that is not the motive behind this subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the provision is a much more limited one. It is to ensure that there is some control to prevent malicious prosecution if prosecutions could be brought privately without any consent. We believe this would add to the anxiety about the risk of prosecution, albeit an unsuccessful prosecution, felt by people who are dealing quite innocently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a great relief to me to know that you, Sir Stephen, are listening, because you and I are the only two people in the Committee who are listening to me so far as I can make out, and I am very glad there are two of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that anxiety of this kind could inhibit quite proper share dealing, which the Government, of course, has no wish to discourage, particularly in the period when the provisions are first introduced and before people have been able to see what they mean in practice. This subsection, therefore, limits the right to institute a prosecution and, in the case of private prosecutions, requires the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. In Scotland prosecutions are, in any case, under the control of the Lord Advocate and no particular provisions are, therefore, required. There will therefore be seen to be a control to ensure that prosecutions are brought only in cases where they are justified, and, furthermore, there will be a procedure for ensuring that the decisions on these matters are taken in a consistent and responsible fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said all that, and before my right hon. Friend gets up again, may I say to him that he has asked a very good question. It may well be that the Secretary of State, who will wish to retain the right to prosecute, should get the permission of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0339">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>619</span>
one of the Law Officers before he does so. This is something that perhaps would satisfy my right hon. Friend, and I shall be happy to look at it between now and Report and write to my right hon. Friend about it. By the time I have finished writing these letters and my right hon. Friend finished reading them, the Report stage should be very near.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to flog this point unnecessarily, but I notice that we have the previous Solicitor-General with us and it is very much a point with which he is concerned. I know how hard he worked as Solicitor-General in dealing with matters which required the consent of the Attorney-General. I know how he instructed the Director of Public Prosecutions, and what brilliant reports he got from the police in the inquiries he required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fact, my right hon. Friend gave me my case—gave it to me as it were on a platter—by saying that in Scotland it is the Lord Advocate, so why in England should it not be the Attorney-General? It puts the Secretary of State in a very difficult position if there is any politics involved in this. The public do not believe that the Secretary of State is impartial. They do believe that the Attorney-General is impartial. I think it is saving a poor unfortunate future Secretary of State from great embarrassment from time to time in having to make this decision. Anyway, I would merely ask my right hon. Friend to consider it, and I am grateful for what he said in his speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister could also consider this new clause and subsection in the light of the Consents to Prosecution Act, where the number of matters which remain with the Attorney-General were cut down substantially and left with the Director. This covers the point which has been made by the right hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was a little discourteous in that I did not deal with the point which the hon. Member for Swansea, East (Mr. Anderson) made about the difference between the provisions under this clause and those under new clause 27, I apologise to the hon. Member for that. We believe that the possibilities of mischievous private prosecutions under new clause 27 are not nearly as likely as they are under clause 42,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>620</span>
and that is the reason why there is a difference in the provision made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I deal with one other point which my right hon. Friend raised, on the question of subsection (3) and the fact that we are making a major change in the law in this subsection, as he pointed out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason we wish to make it clear in this subsection that the insider deals done remain valid is the enormous complications of trying to unravel such deals which may have been made in the market by the time the prosecution is brought. By that time the insider may have disposed of his shares; they may be scattered all over the market. It would be very difficult in many of these cases to unscramble the deal. Therefore, we wish to make it quite clear that in the case of the bona fide purchaser who bought shares, albeit in which an insider dealer had been involved, the contracts remain valid. We think it would just cause chaos if it were different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>(3) For the purposes of this Part of this Act a person deals in securities if (whether as principal or agent) he buys or sells or agrees to buy or sell any securities; and references in this Part of this Act to dealing in securities on a recognised stock exchange shall include references to dealing in those securities through any investment exchange.</p>

I think, Sir Stephen, that it would be for the convenience of the Committee if we rose after discussing the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spencer Le Marchant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. [	<i>Laughter.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I now understand Sir Stephen, that only you and I were listening to me on the last clause. All sorts of insider deals of a very nasty kind that only the Whips Office and the Opposition Front Bench can cobble together were being done, as a result of which I was misinformed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 46 deals with the interpretation of the insider dealing clauses. The parts of the clause of particular interest are subsections (1) and (2), the definitions of connected persons and "unpublished price-sensitive information". The latter definition is of course, of crucial importance and we have already discussed it at some length on new clause 42.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to turn, therefore, to the definition of connected persons. In many respects this is based on the definition in the 1978 Bill. However, we have made a number of alterations. We have made a distinction between directors and other officers and employees of the company. Officers—other than directors—and employees are now placed on a par with accountants, buyers and others who have a professional or business relationship with the company: that is, they are only to be counted as connected persons if their position is likely to give them access to inside information as defined in the Bill. This, we think, is an improvement. It would surely be strange to treat the tea-lady as more of an insider for the purposes of these clauses than the company's accountant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: She knows everything!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was just about to add that, unless it is different in business from the Department of Trade, she is probably the best-informed person in the organisation. Still, for the purposes of this argument, we are saying that we think it would be strange to treat her as more of an insider than the company's accountant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Directors are still unconditionally included as connected persons. They are more likely to have access to such information, and we believe it is sensible
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0341">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>623</span>
always to treat them as connected persons, though, of course, they are prohibited only when they actually have the information which we defined in clause 42 as being the sort of information that would make them insiders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also removed substantial shareholders and their employees from the definition that was proposed in a Government amendment on the 1978 Bill. There were many bodies which made representations to this effect, such as the Council for the Securities Industry and the City Company Law Committee. Such shareholders would, of course, still be covered in the same way as anyone else by the tippee provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) provides a definition of dealing in securities. Subsection (4) sets out another set of self-explanatory definitions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a point to raise which may have been covered in the discussion on new clause 42. If it has, I apologise to the Committee and I will simply read the report of the proceedings this morning when it appears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little concerned about the meaning of the phrase in subsection 1(	<i>b</i>):
	<br><blockquote><p>"and which it would be reasonable to expect a person in his position not to disclose".</p></blockquote>
If we go back to our tea-lady, it is well known that tea-ladies do know all the information about a company, and it is also well known that it is part of the tea-ladies' job to disclose the chat to everybody they come across.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I am driving towards is that the test of expecting a person "in his position" not to do something is a subjective test, and the test that we would apply to the tea-lady would be different from the test that we would apply to the managing director. It seems to me that this could be a very difficult area for legislation, and I wonder whether my right hon. Friend has considered this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only other minor point is that in subsection (4), line 30, there is a typographical error and the word should be "subscriber".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot recall whether the Minister referred to it in his reply this morning or not. It was a point taken up by the accountancy bodies in relation to the definition of "securities". I do not know whether the Minister recalls the point that I made; if not, I will repeat it briefly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>624</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I answer now? I think that the clause has been amended so that it now includes options.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask my hon. Friend how it includes options, because I cannot see how it does? While we are dealing with that definition of securities, I am puzzled in that it starts off by saying that securities mean listed securities. If one were careless in reading the definition, one might get the impression that all the clauses about which we have been talking apply only to listed securities. The notes about clauses also give that impression. But when I go on to read the whole definition, it says that any shares, not just listed securities but:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the case of a company within the meaning of the 1948 Act … any shares, any debentures or any right to subscribe for, call for or make delivery of a share or debenture."</p></blockquote>
I read the clauses to start off with as dealing with listed securities, the whole purpose being that the public should not be misled in the public lists and public advertising of the value of shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Above that there is also a difficult definition, that of "company".
	<br><blockquote><p>"'company' means any company, whether a company within the meaning of the 1948 Act or not."</p></blockquote>
Why "or not"? What does that mean? Does it not mean "every company"? Why does it refer to the 1948 Act? We shall be dealing with the 1980 Act, and companies will be differently structured under the Bill when it becomes an Act. I do not see why in a definition of "company" we have to say that "company" means "company", just like that, and then add
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether a company within the meaning of the 1948 Act or not."</p></blockquote>
Surely it means "any company". Earlier I inquired the position of statutory corporations. Are they companies? What is the position of chartered companies, those which are formed under a Royal Charter? Are they within this definition?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid, Sir Stephen, that I am working upwards or backwards. I started at the bottom of the sheet and now I am going to the top. In the middle I come across subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>), which will be extremely difficult to interpret in any litigation:
	<br><blockquote><p>"is not generally known to those persons who are accustomed or would be likely to deal in those securities but which would if it were generally known to them be likely materially to affect the price of those securities."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0342">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>625</span>
I feel sorry for anyone who is prosecuting with that definition behind him to produce proof of all those points: "generally known", "likely to deal", "likely materially to affect". I appreciate the difficulty in catching the transactions that the public wish us to catch, the sort of transaction which is obviously wrong and ought to suffer a penalty under these provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the 1978 Bill—although it cuts me to the quick to praise a Bill which was not introduced by my own Government—seemed to have a much simpler definition of what is required here. We seem to have leapt from a fairly simple definition—perhaps a little too simple—to one that is extremely complicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moving yet further up the new clause, my hon. Friend has already called attention to that difficult phrase in subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>):
	<br><blockquote><p>"it would be reasonable to expect a person in his position not to disclose except for the proper performance of his functions."</p></blockquote>
I suppose one has to consider what are the functions of the potential offender and then raise the hypothetical question: Is it reasonable to expect him not to disclose something when he is in that position? There again, it will be enormously difficult to prove.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One further point. Does the list of those who appear at the beginning of subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>), in the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"he occupies a position as an officer (other than director) or employee of that company or a related company or a position involving a professional or business relationship between himself (or his employer or a company …)"</p></blockquote>
include trade union officials who are in discussion with the company, who are employees perhaps? I presume they would come under the title of employees of the company, but suppose that the trade union official who was carrying out negotiations is not an employee of the company and obtains inside information, as undoubtedly he must do if he is carrying out his negotiations properly. Is he to be treated as an insider so that he would suffer penalty if he disclosed that inside information under circumstances to which subsection (2) would apply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I deal first with the points raised by my right hon. Friend.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>626</span>
He asked where options come into the definition of securities. If he looks at line 43—in fact, part of the definition which he read out—
	<br><blockquote><p>"any debentures or any right to subscribe for, call for or make delivery of".</p></blockquote>
"Call for or make delivery of" is a way of covering options, and that is how options are brought within the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend then asked why:
	<br><blockquote><p>"within the meaning of the 1948 Act or not"?</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I then went on to ask more about the definition of "securities" and why it started off by saying "listed securities" and then covered practically everything. Does it really cover everything in that definition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall think about that point and come back to it in the course of my remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend then asked why "or not" was included and the answer is that we are now beginning to see foreign companies quoted on British exchanges and foreign securities dealt with. For instance, a very good example is the shares in IBM, which may or may not be a British listed company under the 1948 Companies Act. That was why the "or not" was added. It had a specific purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend then raised a point on subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>):
	<br><blockquote><p>"is not generally known to those persons who are accustomed or would be likely to deal in those securities but which would if it were generally known to them be likely materially to affect the price of those securities."</p></blockquote>
He said he would not like to be the prosecuting counsel having to try to make a prosecution stick using that definition. It is difficult to define price-sensitive information, but I do not think that in practice, as we discussed in a number of practical examples today, it will be too difficult for the courts to interpret these sections, because what is price sensitive in one particular set of circumstances might not be in another. We talked about the size of the company and the sick chairman, and so on, this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that this definition hangs together and that it will not be too difficult for the courts to interpret. Certainly, when I read it myself I thought that it was fairly clear. I am slightly surprised at my right hon. Friend's comments on that particular set of words, because I thought that we had dealt with them in principle
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0343">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>627</span>
this morning, when we discussed the whole question of the definition of the sort of information that could trigger off an action against a person, or that would make a person an insider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Baker), asked a question about the last few lines of subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>):
	<br><blockquote><p>"and which it would be reasonable to expect a person in his position not to disclose except for the proper performance of his functions".</p></blockquote>
I was a little puzzled about "proper performance of his functions". It was pointed out to me that it would be perfectly proper for the financial director of a company which was on the point of doing a deal, and which needed to raise funds from its bank, to go along and say to the bank. "These are the reasons why we deserve this additional support. The company is doing marvellously, and we are about to do this and that. One of the things we have been working on for a long time is about to come home to roost. We hope in these circumstances you will give us a line of credit."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the information which is being given will be price-sensitive, but there is equally no doubt that it is being given in the proper performance of his duty by the person who is giving it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We say that it is, to an extent, a subjective test. The chairman standing in the bar of his golf club saying "My company's shares are going through the roof in a couple of months or a couple of weeks because"—is one thing. It is not reasonable to expect a person in his position to disclose that information. The mythical tea-lady whom we have discussed says to her friend "Isn't it marvellous? The company is going to buy a new business, and you and I are going to be able to work overtime because they are going to have even bigger premises". Again, we do not believe that the tea-lady should be prosecuted for imparting price-sensitive information to her fellow tea-lady. There is, then, a subjective test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend asked me a question to which the answer has just occurred to me as I have stood here speaking. He asked about the definition of listed securities. This is the answer that occurred to me—but it does not look to me like a particularly convincing answer. "Listed securities" goes to the clause on Stock Exchange dealers. The rest of the definition goes to establish the scope for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>628</span>
off market dealings in advertised securities. The securities may not be listed, and so it covers shares, debentures and options. Thus, it covers listed securities, and then it also covers those off-market securities which may not be listed but the dealings in which are covered by these clauses. That is the reason for the wording of that paragraph of the definitions clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask a little further about that? New clause 42, which we discussed this morning, merely says "securities". True, it says
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall not deal on a recognised stock exchange"</p></blockquote>
but it does not necessarily mean, unless I am wrong, that everything that one buys and sells on a recognised stock exchange is a listed security. New clause 42 uses only the word "securities", without limiting it to "listed securities".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition in new clause 46 is perfectly clear. It starts off by saying that "securities" means listed securities, and goes on to say
	<br><blockquote><p>"and … any shares, any debentures or any right to subscribe"</p></blockquote>
and so on. That, surely, means the shares of any company, not just those which are listed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One other point. I do not think my hon. Friend answered my query as to whether a trade union official is included in subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the second question my right hon. Friend posed is "No", at the moment he is not. I am sorry. Perhaps I may have second thoughts. I read this note last night, so may I just say to my right hon. Friend that there is an argument that trade union officials will have access, in the course of carrying out their duties, to price-sensitive information. They may go along to negotiate with a company and say "We want to make a wage claim of such-and-such size", and the company, being very open—a lot of these things are done in this way now—puts its cards on the table and says "This is how things are going". The union officials then become possessors of price-sensitive information which they have acquired from the company and which, if they used it, could produce them profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised—I apologise for misleading my right hon. Friend—that such
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0344">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>629</span>
officials will come within the prohibitions as the clauses are drafted. I am sorry; when I read the note late last night I thought it was an argument, a defensive note, saying why trade union officials should not be included. In fact, they are included and covered by this subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to listed securities, I repeat to my right hon. Friend what I said to him before, that some of the securities which will be dealt with will not be listed in the sense that they appear in a Stock Exchange list. They may be dealt in in the across-the-counter market, and this definition is an attempt to catch a range of transactions in all the shares that are covered by new clauses 42 to 46.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>AMENDMENT OF SECTION 454 OF THE 1948 ACT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"Section 454(1) of the 1948 Act (Power of Secretary of State to alter or add to requirements of 1948 and 1967 Acts relating to balance sheets and accounts) after the words 'group accounts' there shall be inserted the words 'and a report of the directors of a company which is required by section 157 of this Act to be attached to the company's balance sheet'.".—[	<i>Mr. Eyre.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This new clause is straightforward and largely self-explanatory. I shall be very brief in moving it because I know that other members of the Committee wish to deal with subsequent business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 454(1) of the Companies Act 1948 gives the Secretary of State power to alter or add to the requirements of the Companies Act which relate to the accounts of companies. We shall be laying an order on Monday 10 December under section 454 which will raise a number of monetary thresholds in the Companies Acts, as we promised when we published the Green Paper on company accounting and disclosure back in September.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we came to look at the monetary thresholds in the Companies Acts, we found that there is one—it is the single
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>630</span>
exception—namely, the requirement to disclose charitable and political contributions where these exceed £50 which could not be raised by order. This is because the requirement under section 19 of the Companies Act 1967 is for such contributions to be disclosed in the director's report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that on general grounds it is desirable to have the same power to alter the director's report as for the accounts of the company and, in particular, we believe it to be sensible to raise the £50 threshold in respect of charitable and political donations under section 19 of the 1967 Act, to reflect inflation since the time it was enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We therefore intend, when this Bill becomes law—I shall be quite frank with the Committee—to increase the threshold for charitable and political contributions by an amount which broadly reflects the effect of inflation since 1967.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a matter at which we shall want to look most carefully. Could the Minister indicate not just the broad basis of calculation but what it would mean in terms of the actual increase in the threshold as at the present day, so that we may have it spelt out to us clearly? It is difficult just to go on the assertion which he has just made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman's question is fairly simple, and I shall be able to give an answer if I can concentrate on the arithmetical process necessary. Very broadly, if the amount was £50 in 1967—taking account of the fact that money was halved in value between 1974 and 1978 and other factors—a sum of about £200 would be needed. If one was minded to donate to a charity and one had put £50 in in 1967, one would need to donate about £200 in 1980 to donate a sum of equal worth in money in real terms. The adjustment would be based on the rate of inflation and the fall in the value of money over that period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are concerned about this because, as I gave notice in relation to a previous matter, we think that this question of disclosure is important. I am not impressed by the argument which the Minister has adduced. What he is really arguing is a sort of 	<i>de minimis</i> provision here, taking it to £200
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0345">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>631</span>
instead of£50. I shall ignore his comments about the period 1974–78. I could refer to Chancellor Barber and his profligacy—but I shall ignore that, having stated it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is that we should be wanting to extend the area of disclosure, not confine it. In this respect, the hon. Gentleman's proposal is not one which I find particularly compelling. However, we can come back to it. I should want to think about it again. I am bound to say that I did not look at this matter carefully. It was a starred new clause, and I was not sure that we should get to it. We shall want to come back to this, no doubt, on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In 1948 Parliament saw fit to put this figure in as a fixed figure, to be altered only by statute. We are asked now to alter it in future by statutory instrument. Without the section in front of me—I am sorry I did not look it up first—I am not sure whether that statutory instrument requires an affirmative resolution or is merely subject to the negative procedure. No doubt, if it is an order similar to the one which my hon. Friend contemplates bringing in on 10 December, it will be possible to advise him straight away, and he can advise the Committee, whether it is an affirmative or negative order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Negative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to the hon. Gentleman. That means that we are altering the complete procedure, laid down, I presume, with thought, in I948, that these figures of charitable contributions should not be altered unless Parliament, in going through the whole process of legislation, so decided. It is quite a major point. It is not just a little matter of drafting or tidying-up to say now that in future this will be done by means of a statutory instrument subject only to the negative procedure.

evidently there was some good purpose for it, and, as the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) said, we really would like to think a little more about this and turn up the debates in 1947—as I suppose it was—and see what the reason was then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend that it would be a negative procedure if one were reducing the requirements for a change of the kind which is contemplated. I do not really know the reason for the different procedures laid down in the 1967 Act, but, against the background of inflation and the changes that that has brought about, I would suggest to my right hon. Friend it is not unreasonable to look at all these provisions which establish thresholds, and get into a position more easily to be able to adjust to necessary changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point was that if it had to be altered by statute, why not alter it by statute now? Let us have a new clause in the Bill altering it here and now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What we are proposing to do by the clause is to make a statutory change to enable us, by way of a statutory instrument, to make a change. In a way I am responding to my right hon. Friend, because we propose to make a statutory change. He himself believes that there is a great need to change previous Acts of Parliament by statute, and that is basically what we are doing, to put ourselves into a position to consider the terms of an order meeting this fall in the value of money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to come back to my hon. Friend, but I want to stress this point. Since he is bringing in an order showing the figures which are going to apply in future to the other limits, he knows the amount which is intended to be put in an order eventually over the charitable contributions. All I am suggesting is that we have in the Bill the same

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>633</span>
sort of thing as in 1967, a new figure fixed in the Bill. Then if he likes he can go on and say that that can be altered in future by statutory instrument. I do not see why we should pass this clause over some mysterious figure that is to be brought in at some future date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have a disagreement on this point, and I think, on reflection, that the best way to ensure that the Government think about it again is to vote this down now. Otherwise we shall probably get some other form of words. The easiest way is to vote on it now. If we have a Division now, that would probably be for the convenience of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask my hon. Friend to let us have his assurance on this? I am afraid, like my right hon. Friend, that I have not done my homework on this. Does the clause relate only to charitable and political contributions, and nothing else? If that is all it is, I am not so worried.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause relates to establishing a new basis upon which provisions in the 1967 Act can be amended</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>by statutory instrument. It certainly includes the item that I have spelled out with great frankness so that my right hon. Friend should know exactly where we are about this matter. I think, with respect that he will realise our difficulty in trying to comply with the request that he fires from the hip now, about being able to specify actually in the new clause the figures that he demands. I have told him what will be the position in the order that we shall lay on Monday next, and I must ask him to accept that we are trying to change the machinery. Section 454 of the 1948 Act provides for alteration by order of accounts provision, and where the new provision is more onerous, an affirmative resolution is required, but where there is a less onerous requirement, the negative procedure is required. I suggest to my right hon. Friend that that is entirely reasonable in all the circumstances. I have told him very frankly exactly what is to be done on Monday, so that he knows exactly the circumstances in which the clause will operate.</p>
