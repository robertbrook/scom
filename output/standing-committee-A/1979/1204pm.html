	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we resume our discussions on new clause 28, I have an announcement to make with regards to new clause 30. In the new version which appears on the Paper today, a new subsection (4) has appeared, which is the reason for the clause being starred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, because of a printer's error, the original subsection (4) has been omitted instead of continuing to appear as subsection (5).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That subsection, which should appear at the end of subsection (4) on page 356, reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(5) Subsections (2) and (3) above do not apply in relation to a transaction, arrangement or agreement which was made before the appointed day and which does not subsist on or after that day."</p></blockquote>
The present subsection (5) on page 356 will become subsection (6).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause to be put to the Committee should therefore be in this form. Copies are available on the table.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<ol>
	<li>any transaction or arrangement of a kind described in section (Prohibition of loans etc. to directors and connected persons) above entered into by the company or by a subsidiary of the company for a person who at any time during the relevant period was a director of the company or was connected with such a director;</li>

	<li>an agreement by the company or by a subsidiary of the company to enter into any such transaction or arrangement for a person who at any time during the relevant period was a director of the company or was connected with such a director; and</li>
	<li>any other transaction or arrangement with a subsidiary of the company in which a person who at any time during the relevant period was a director of the company had, directly or indirectly, a material interest.</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(2) Subject as aforesaid, accounts so prepared by any company other than a holding company in respect of a financial year (the "relevant period") ending on or after the appointed day shall contain the particulars specified in section (Particulars to be disclosed in accounts) below of—
	<ol>
	<li>any transaction or arrangement of a kind described in section (Prohibition of loans etc. to directors and connected persons) above entered into by any company for a person who at any time during the relevant period was a director of the company or of its holding company or was connected with such a director;</li>
	<li>an agreement by the company to enter into any such transaction or arrangement for a person who at any time during the relevant period was a director of the company or of its holding company or was connected with such a director; and</li>
	<li>any other transaction or arrangement with the company in which a person who at any time during the relevant period was a director of the company or of its holding company had, directly or indirectly, a material interest.</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(3) Where by virtue of section 150(2)(	<i>b</i>) of the 1948 Act a company does not produce group accounts in relation to any financial year, subsection (1) above shall have effect in relation to the company and that financial year as if the word "group" were omitted.</p>
	<p>(4) For the purposes of subsections (1)(	<i>c</i>) and (2)(	<i>c</i>) above—
	<ol>
	<li>a transaction, arrangement or agreement between a company and a director of the company or of its holding company or a person connected with such a director shall (if it would not otherwise be so treated) be treated as a transaction, arrangement or agreement in which that director is interested; and</li>
	<li>an interest in such a transaction, arrangement or agreement is not material if in the opinion of the majority of the directors (other than that director) of the company which is preparing the accounts in question it is not material (but without prejudice to the question whether or not such an interest is material in any case where those directors have not considered the matter).</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(5) Subsections (1) and (2) above do not apply, for the purposes of any accounts prepared by any company which is or is the holding company of a recognised bank, in relation to a transaction or arrangement of a kind described in section (Prohibition of loans, etc. to directors and connected persons) above, or an agreement to enter into such a transaction or arrangement, to which that recognised bank is a party.</p>

	<li>a contract of service between a company and one of its directors;</li>
	<li>a transaction, arrangement or agreement which was not entered into during the relevant period for the accounts in question or which did not subsist at any time during that period;</li>
	<li>a transaction, arrangement or agreement which was made before the appointed day and which does not subsist on or after that day.</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(7) Subsections (1) and (2) above apply whether or not—
	<ol>
	<li>the transaction or arrangement was prohibited by section (Prohibition of loans etc. to directors and connected persons) above;</li>
	<li>the person for whom it was made was a director of the company or was connected with a director of the company at the time it was made;</li>
	<li>in the case of a transaction or arrangement made by a company which at any time during a relevant period is a subsidiary of another company, it was a subsidiary of that other company at the time the transaction or arrangement was made.".—(	<i>Mr. Parkinson.</i>)</li></ol></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed [this day</i>], That the clause be read a Second time.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister For Trade (Mr. Cecil Parkinson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned, I was dealing with the points which my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) raised. He explained to me this morning that he was on another Committee this afternoon, and I therefore said that I would answer the points so that he could read my reply in 	<i>Hansard</i> when it becomes available. We were looking at the material interest test in subsection (4), which governs whether any transaction or arrangement referred to in subsection (1)(	<i>c</i>) and (2)(	<i>c</i>) should be disclosed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me repeat that the transactions or arrangements in question are a residual category. They are the transactions and so forth other than those to be disclosed under subsections (1)(	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>) and (2)(	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>), that is, transactions other than the loans, quasi-loans and so forth, specified in new clause 23.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>518</span>
The test in subsection (4), therefore, applies to three sorts of transaction: first, loans and so forth made to persons other than the specified range of connected persons—for example, a director might have a material interest in a contract between his company and a company run by his brother; secondly, consultancy and other contracts for services between a director and his company, such agreements not at present being required to be disclosed because the existing disclosure provision in section 26 of the 1967 Act relates only to contracts of employment and not to contracts of service; thirdly, any other evasive ways of effecting the deal described in new clause 23.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You can see, Sir Stephen, that cynicism is spreading rapidly throughout the Department of Trade, and it is virtually impossible to conjure up some new skilful way of manipulating the law which the Department has not thought of already. Subsection (3) is a catch-all clause and a very effective one too—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The third category.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—in the third category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of subsection (4) is not that every interest should be treated as material. It is, on the contrary, our intention that there should be no presumption either way. Further, we do not require all matters to be put to directors. If the particular director's interest is obviously too trivial and remote to merit the consideration of the other directors, there is no need for him to invite them to consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point, raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Stevens), was whether, in the case of a sales director remunerated partly on a commission basis, each contract for the sale of goods between his company and an unconnected third party would have to be disclosed. I am advised that as the director would not have any greater interest in one such contract than another, his interest in such contracts would not therefore be material, and hence need not be disclosed. I should add that such a sales director's own contract with the company for his services will itself have to be disclosed, but the separate sales transactions with other parties, for the reason I have given, need not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, there was a point raised by the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0285">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>519</span>
Davis) in relation to subsection (6)(	<i>c</i>). He asked whether the exemption embodied in this subsection, namely, that subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to transactions which should not subsist at any time during the relevant period, is consistent with good accounting practice, and he said some very nice things about my own skill as an accountant which I only wish were true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to that is "Yes", because if a transaction of this kind was a significant transaction entered into after the end of the financial year, section 149 of the 1948 Act would still require disclosure on the true and fair basis. In other words, the new clause does not in any way detract from the true and fair requirement; it merely adds a new and specific requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have dealt with the points raised by hon. Members in the debate, and I am sorry that my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby is not here to hear the replies to the points that he raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>PARTICULARS REQUIRED TO BE INCLUDED IN ACCOUNTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"(1) The particulars of a transaction, arrangement which are required by section (Substantial contracts, etc., with directors and others to be disclosed in accounts) to be included in the annual accounts prepared by a company are particulars of the principal terms of the transaction, arrangement or agreement and (without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provision)—
	<ol>
	<li>a statement of the fact either that the transaction, arrangement or agreement was made, or subsisted, as the case may be, during the financial year in respect of which those accounts are made up;</li>
	<li>the name of the person for whom it was made, and, where that person is or was connected with a director of the company or of its holding company, the name of that director;</li>
	<li>in any case where subsection (1)(	<i>c</i>) or (2)(	<i>c</i>) of section (Substantial contracts, etc., with directors and others to be disclosed in accounts) applies, the name of the director with the material interest and the nature of that interest;</li>
	<li>in the case of a loan or an agreement for a loan or an arrangement within section (Prohibition of loans, etc., to directors and connected persons) (3) or (4) above relating to a loan—</li>
	<span class='label label-info column'>520</span>
	<ol>
	<li>the amount of the liability of the person to whom the loan was or was agreed to be made, in respect of principal and interest, at the beginning and at the end of that period;</li>
	<li>the maximum amount of that liability during that period;</li>
	<li>the amount of any interest which, having fallen due, has not been paid; and</li>
	<li>the amount of any provision (within the meaning of Schedule 8 to the 1948 Act) made in respect of any failure or anticipated failure by the borrower to repay the whole or part of the loan or to pay the whole or part of any interest thereon;</li>
</ol>
	<li>in the case of a guarantee or security or an arrangement within section (Prohibition of loans etc. to directors and connected persons) (3) above relating to a guarantee or security—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>the amount for which the company (or its subsidiary) was liable under the guarantee or in respect of the security both at the beginning and at the end of the financial year in question;</li>
	<li>the maximum amount for which the company (or its subsidiary) may become so liable; and</li>
	<li>any amount paid and any liability incurred by the company (or its subsidiary) for the purpose of fulfilling the guarantee or discharging the security (including any loss incurred by reason of the enforcement of the guarantee or security); and</li>
</ol>
	<li>in the case of any other transaction, arrangement or agreement, the value of the transaction or arrangement, or, as the case may be, the value of the transaction or arrangement to which the agreement relates."—[	<i>Mr. Parkinson.</i>]</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the clause is to specify the particulars which are to be given for each transaction, attangement or agreement for which the previous clause requires disclosure. Basically, the requirement is the very simple one stated in the opening to subsection (1), that the principal terms of such deals shall be entered into the accounts for each financial year, except for recognised banks, to which, as we know, separate procedures will apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The "principal terms" include those relating to the advancement of the cash or non-cash asset, and the arrangements for the repayment of the value of such an asset, including any interest component, together with any securities or guarantees thereto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause goes on to state two particulars which are required of any transaction
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0286">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>521</span>
and so forth, and then specifies certain details, depending on the sort of transaction and so forth in question. Thus, paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>) require the statement of the obvious, namely, that the transaction and so forth was made or subsisted during the financial year in question and that the director involved be named.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next, paragraph (	<i>c</i>) requires that, where the material interest test applies, that is, for transactions and so forth other than those defined in new clause 23, the director be named and his interest disclosed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (	<i>d</i>) provides that certain details must be provided in the case of loans and agreements to enter into loans, and also loans subject to arrangements for assignment or back-to-back deals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (	<i>e</i>) covers guarantees and securities, and arrangements for the assignment of guarantees and securities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (	<i>f</i>) requires that in the case of any other transactions and so forth other than those covered above in
paragraphs (	<i>d</i>) and (	<i>e</i>), the financial quantum to be disclosed is the value of such transaction or arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (	<i>f</i>) is therefore a very concise way of requiring the following particulars. For quasi-loans, the sum to be disclosed is the amount to be reimbursed, in the case of the company buying goods, for example, on behalf of a director, as happened in the Peachey case, or the maximum amount to be reimbursed, in the case of company credit cards. For credit transactions the sum to be disclosed is the arm's length value of the goods and services concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Arrangements for assignments are to be disclosed by reference to the value of the basic transactions to which they relate, except where they relate to loans, guarantees and securities, in which case the sums prescribed earlier, in paragraphs (	<i>d</i>) and (	<i>e</i>), are applicable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, arrangements for back-to-back deals are to be disclosed by reference to the value of the basic transactions and so forth to which they relate, except in the case of loans, which are covered by paragraph (	<i>d</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My hon. Friend for High Peak (Mr. Le Marchant) has demonstrated a fantastic capacity for playing a number of roles in this Committee. He is actually whipping both sides of the Committee at the same time. From time to time, he is an excellent alternative Chairman. I would be most grateful to him if he would help me out of my lonely state and add his name to my clause, thus adding a further distinct contribution to this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 30 provides for the disclosure in company accounts of the aggregate volume of loans, quasi-loans and credit transactions, and other devices relating to them, for two groups of person. Firstly, such transactions made in favour of officers—other than directors—of all companies shall be disclosed in the aggregate. Secondly, for recognised banks only, the aggregate of all such transactions with directors and their connected persons shall be disclosed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These provisions supplement the disclosure requirements in new clauses 28 and 29 for companies other than recognised banks and for recognised banks in new clause 31.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Committee will recall that when we looked at new clause 24 and discussed the exemption for recognised banks from the prohibitions on lending and so on we noted that a separate disclosure regime was to apply for recognised banks as regards the transactions and arrangements specified in new clause 23. In fact, technically speaking, subsection (5) of new clause 28 exempts the recognised banks from the disclosure regime applicable to other companies and thus paves the way for new clause 31.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>525</span>
As we have already indicated, we consider that, while it is reasonable to permit recognised banks to lend to their directors without limit so long as the transactions are made in the ordinary course of business and on normal commercial terms, we must provide an incentive to deter any abuse by any of those institutions included within the definition of a recognised bank. This is to be done by making available to shareholders the information necessary to enable them to make a judgement on the scope and content of a bank's lending to its directors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, therefore, to the aggregate information on directors and on other officers to be entered into the accounts of a recognised bank by virtue of new clause 30—and therefore available to the wider public—this new clause requires the maintenance of an internal register of all transactions made to directors and connected persons within the terms of new clause 23.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A statement, based on the register but also containing financial details of each transaction relating to a director and connected person, shall be open to inspection by shareholders for a 15-day period up to and including the date of the annual general meeting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to relieve the banks of the minutiae of disclosure, in subsection (4) of new clause 32 there is an exemption for the purposes of this clause for all transactions which in aggregate amount to less than £1,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause reflects a suggestion made by then Opposition in Committee on the previous Bill. The suggestion has been developed and improved by the Department. It says that shareholders should be told the aggregate amount of loans, and should, for a specified period each year, have the right to go and find out details from a statement of transactions between the directors and officers of banks and the bank itself.

We believe that the present clause is an acceptable way of dealing with the difficult problem of retaining confidentiality, which the banks are anxious to do, while at the same time giving shareholders knowledge of the transactions between the directors and their bank.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause provides threshold or de minimis limits for various purposes in relation to the disclosure provisions in new clauses 28 and 31.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of subsections (1) and (2) is to provide a de minimis limit for the disclosure of credit transactions. If the aggregate of the outstanding liabilities under credit transactions, or any arrangements relating to such transactions, of a director, together with his connected persons, do not exceed £5,000 at any time during the financial year, then none of these transactions need to be disclosed in the accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This threshold limit is necessary in order to avoid an excessive number of entries in the company accounts. Petty transactions involving deferred payment by directors are very common and are not considered to be the subject of an abuse which we wish to control; it is only when such transactions involve larger sums that disclosure is necessary in order to prevent abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) provides a threshold limit for the disclosure of the residual category of transactions described in subsections (1)(	<i>c</i>) and (2)(	<i>c</i>) of new clause 28, namely, transactions which do not fall within the loan, quasi-loan, or credit transaction categories but in which a director has a "material interest"; these are mainly property transactions of the type described in new clause 22 and contracts for service covered in new clause 21.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The de minimis figure, below which such transactions do not require to be disclosed, is flexible to take account of the needs of different sizes of company. If the aggregate of all such transactions involving a director and his connected person does not exceed £1,000, then, for all sizes of company, they will not have to be disclosed. For large companies the relevant figure is £5,000, and for companies whose net assets are worth between £1,000 and
	<span class='label label-info column'>528</span>
£5,000, disclosure is required only if the aggregate figure exceeds 1 per cent. of the company's net assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of subsection (4) is to exempt disclosure by recognised banks, in the manner described in new clause 31, of any transaction and so forth if the aggregate of the values of each transaction made for that director or for any person connected with him does not exceed £1,000 at any time during the financial year. The purpose of this is to avoid cluttering the statement available to shareholders with unnecessary detail of transactions with directors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may wonder why this threshold is considered necessary for banks but not for other companies. The reasoning behind this is that the volume of loans and quasi-loans made by a recognised bank to its directors and connected persons—which includes associated companies—in the ordinary course of business is likely to be considerable. For other companies such transactions and 'so forth are not so common and, in the case of loans and quasi-loans, are subject to varying degrees of prohibition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose behind all the threshold limits detailed in this clause is to eliminate the disclosure of unnecessary information, and I trust that hon. Members will find them acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of new clause 33 is to widen the provisions of section 199 of the 1948 Act, which covers the disclosure to the hoard by a director of his interest in contracts to which the company is a party. The board needs to know of the interest of individual directors in the transactions and so on described in new clause 23, and section 199, therefore, requires amendment to cover such transactions and to cover connected persons. The effect will be to eliminate the looseness of its reference to a director's direct or indirect interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members will be aware, the previous administration proposed, in clause 54 of their Bill, to compel directors to give an exhaustive notice of all their connected persons within 28 days of the appointed day or of the connection's becoming known to them. Substantial penalties were provided for default. We on this side objected strongly to this measure when it was discussed in Committee, and considered then, as we still do, that such a measure, which would compel directors to disclose potentially embarrassing connections with illegitimate children, estranged spouses, and so on, even when there was no prospect of transaction between these persons and the company, would be an unnecessary invasion of
	<span class='label label-info column'>530</span>
personal privacy. We believe, therefore, that directors should not be compelled to produce all this information if they do not wish to do so. We shall, however of course maintain the existing requirement in the 1948 Act, that directors must disclose their interest on each occasion that a transaction arises between the company and one of their circle of connected persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to achieve what we consider to be a fair balance between the need for disclosure of directors' interests in all such transactions and the need to prevent unnecessary invasion of privacy, we have provided, in subsection (1) of new clause 33, that all transactions or arrangements of the kind described in new clause 33—in other words, including such transactions and so forth with connected persons—must be disclosed by the director concerned in accordance with section 199. With this change to subsection (1), subsection (2) of section 199 will then provide for a director to declare interest only on each occasion that the company proposes to enter into a contract in which he is interested. He is also required to declare this interest if it arises subsequent to the company's entering into the contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) of new clause 33 clarifies what is required for a director to be "interested" in a contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we have achieved a good balance in the clause and in the amendment to section 199, providing an effective disclosure requirement without forcing directors unnecessarily to divulge personally confidential information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not wholly convinced by the hon. Gentleman's argument, and I was not entirely convinced that the then Opposition had got the situation right when we discussed the Bill previously. To balance that, however, I am bound to say that I did not think we had it right either. Here I am, then, being very critical of everybody, including myself, but I am still not convinced that this very difficult problem and the anxieties that arise from it are assuaged by the equally emollient words from the Under-Secretary as we get from the Minister for Trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here again we feel it is desirable, before we are able to embark upon a considered view of the matter, that we consult with the accountancy bodies and others, in order to see whether the Government have got this right at present
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0291">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>531</span>
I do not know the views of the Law Society about this because, although it has made some comments about a number of clauses, it has made none about this. It may be that that indicates that it is satisfied. It would be helpful if the Minister could disclose what consultations he has had with the Law Society and the Senate about this clause. I have a feeling—I am bound to say that it is more of a "gut" feeling than anything else at present—that the Government have not got this right. It seems to me to represent very much, as he has correctly said, the thinking of the Opposition during the Standing Committee in March of this year. That certainly does not recommend perfection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However I merely want to enter this reservation at this stage. I have said nothing about some of the new clauses which we have just passed for the reasons which I expressed this morning, outside the presence of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Warley, West (Mr. Archer), whose return I very much welcome, because I was sitting here even more lonely than the Minister of State. I hope that the Under-Secretary will recognise that these are very serious matters. They do not divide us in political terms but we ought to give them the closest scrutiny.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to what the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) has said but I believe, after careful consideration of the points which I made in moving this clause, that he will find that a very proper and adequate alternative has been found. In further support of that I should like to point out that we have also maintained the option available in subsection (3) of section 199 for directors to declare in advance by general notice to the board their membership of specified companies or firms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In amendment No. 242 we extend the scope of the information the director may give by such a general notice to cover his connected persons. This general notice is not obligatory. If it is produced, it may not consist of an exhaustive list of all the director's connected persons. If, however, there are subsequently any transactions between the company and any connected persons not so disclosed, the director will be required to disclose his interest at a meeting of the directors of the company
	<span class='label label-info column'>532</span>
in the same way as any interest in the contract not covered by a general notice must be disclosed.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It occurs to me that the hon.

All that one had to disclose was the name of the person with whom the director was connected. That does not seem to me on the face of it to open up all these horrendous perils that the. Minister was alluding to. I merely point that out because I think that he overstated his case. If he had said "Well, we think it went a little too far in some respects", that would have been a legitimate point. I think he over-egged the pudding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Subsection (1) lists the persons to be included in the definition of connected persons. First of all, there are a director's immediate family, taken to include a spouse—including a separated, but not divorced, spouse—and children under the age of 18, and the definition of children is to include any step-children and illegitimate children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next, any company with which a director is "associated" is also deemed to be a connected person of that director for the purpose of most of our provisions. The definition of association with a body corporate is given in subsection (3)(	<i>a</i>); only if the director, together with his connected persons, is interested in at least 20 per cent. of the share capital of the company or is able to control at least 20 per cent. of the voting power at any general meeting is he deemed to be "associated" with that company. An exception to this rule of connection is given in new clause 24(5), which exempts loans made by money-lending companies to directors' associated companies from being included in the calculation of relevant amounts for the purpose of the maximum permitted limit; in other words, money-lending companies are allowed to lend to such associated companies provided they are not controlled by the director without limit—though, as hon. Members will recall, we shall bring forth an amendment to ensure the application of the rules of ordinary course of business and normal commercial terms to loans, etc., to associated companies. A similar exemption will also be granted, as I have already explained, for the disclosure of loans, etc., by those money-lending companies which are recognised banks. Neither of these exemptions extends to cover companies in which directors have a controlling interest, and the definition of control of a body corporate is given in subsection (3)(	<i>b</i>), namely, that directors—together with their connected persons—are either interested in more than 50 per cent. of the share
	<span class='label label-info column'>536</span>
capital or can control over 50 per cent. of the voting power at any general meeting of the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tailpiece to subsection (3) excludes associated companies—and trustees of trusts whose beneficiaries include such companies—from the circle of the directors' connected persons for the purpose of calculating if a company is to be associated with or controlled by a director by virtue of his, and his connected persons', interests in such a company. This exclusion is to avoid the problem of circularity in definition, and to prevent the necessity of long and complex calculations of relatively remote interests, involving the collection of information about companies' holdings in other companies, which may be dfficult to establish. We have, however, been careful to ensure that this exclusion does not provide a loophole through which a director may benefit from transactions with a company controlled indirectly by himself, through the intermediary of another company which he controls and which in turn controls the first company. We have provided, in subsection 4(	<i>b</i>), that a director's "control of the exercise of voting power" is to include control through a company controlled by the director.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last category of persons included in the "connected person" definition in subsection (1) consists of the trustees of trusts whose beneficiaries may include a director or any of his other connected persons. Trustees under a pension scheme or an employees' share scheme, as defined in clause 56, are excluded, so as to allow executive directors to participate in share incentive schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any person included under any of these categories is deemed to be excluded from the definition of connected persons if he or she also happens to be a director of the company. In other words, if, say, husband and wife are both directors of the same company, they are to be treated separately for the purpose of calculating relevant amounts; thus, under the money-lending exemption, for example, husband and wife will each be allowed to receive up to £50,000 in loans on ordinary commercial terms. Thus, all directors are on an equal footing, notwithstanding any connections between them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, subsection (4)(	<i>a</i>) defines "equity share capital" for the purposes of this clause, by reference to section
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0294">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>537</span>
154 of the 1948 Act, and means the issued share capital—but excluding non-participating preference shares, which are generally regarded, with debentures, as prior charges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I challenge the Minister to repeat all that without the benefit of his notes. I must say that I found it extremely difficult to follow, and the wording appears to me to be perhaps even unnecessarily complicated. One has to think, when one construes these statutes, of the problems not only of the people immediately affected but of their advisers, too. Who knows? The Under-Secretary of State and the Minister for Trade may be back in practice in the not too-distant future, as I am today. I therefore look at the matter a little subjectively. I am not at all happy about the draftsmanship of this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, to be more specific, and to leave aside criticisms of a general kind relating to draftsmanship, I just refer to two specific points to which perhaps the Minister could reply. Subsection (2) says that,
	<br><blockquote><p>"a reference to the child or step-child of any person includes a reference to any illegitimate child of that person, but does not include a reference to any person who has attained the age of 18 years."</p></blockquote>
Why not? Is it not conceivable that one would have someone over the age of 18 years who was still within a very tightly knit family? Why should there be that exclusion?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn next to subsection (4) and ask the Minister to justify why one has the position of one half as representing control here rather than a third. Is that for the purposes only of this clause, and why do we have one half for this when one has a third for virtually all purposes? Am I wrong? Maybe I am bemused by the Minister's explanation. Nevertheless, perhaps the Minister could explain that over again, because I might have been particularly sleepy this afternoon. I am very concerned about the first point I made this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to concede at once that the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) is perfectly entitled to describe this clause as complicated, especially in relation to the earlier clauses that we dealt with this morning.
	<span class='label label-info column'>538</span>
Like him, I have considerable sympathy for people in practice who have to advise their company directors on the complexity of these matters. Nevertheless, as the hon. Gentleman will understand, the purpose of this clause is to prevent loopholes from being opened up. Therefore, it is necessary for the clause to be of the length and complexity that it is on the Order Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 35 is substantially the same as the previous Administration's clause, which was numbered clause 55 in the Bill. It therefore re-presents the provision with regard to the child attaining the age of 18 years which the hon. Gentleman mentioned. I think we are all making the assumption now that when a child reaches the age of 18 and becomes entitled to a vote, it has acquired the maturity which entitles it to be independent of the parent. Similarly, the child ceases to be a connected person in the sense we have been using in discussing this clause. I am advised that the connection is only a matter of the nuclear family; once the children are over 18, in law they are, as I have said, no longer dependent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman say "nuclear family"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said "the nuclear family", which, I understand, is a term in broad use in social matters and is well established in its use in that sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I am being particularly obtuse this afternoon, but would the hon. Gentleman define what a "nuclear family" is?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not having been fully experienced in social affairs, where I understand the term is in regular use, I probably would not get it entirely right. I think normally the idea is that there is a family where a great degree of dependency exists. This includes the parent or parents and the dependent child. When the child reaches a certain stage of maturity, for the purpose of voting, as I have said—we assume this now to be at the age of 18—it ceases to be within this concept of the dependency which, I believe, lies at the root of the concept of the nuclear family. I hope the hon. Gentleman will accept that as an explanation. The hon. Gentleman referred
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0295">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>539</span>
more specifically to subsection (4). In seeking to answer his question, I have to go back to subsection (3). The references in subsection (3) to a person being interested in shares of a company relate to the definition of "interest" in section 28 of the 1967 Act, which includes reference to such indirect methods of control. The definition provided in subsection (3) of that section is a little too stringent for our purposes, as it includes companies in which the intermediary companies—that is, those in which the person in question is directly interested—control at least one third of the voting power in general meeting. In order to be consistent with our definition of "control", subsection (4)—this is the point the hon. Gentleman raised—amends the wording of section 28 for the purposes of this section so that it catches only such companies as control half of the voting power in question. As I said, we have provided in subsection (4)(	<i>b</i>) that a director's control of the exercise of voting power is to include control through a company controlled by the director. Subsection (4) only alters the rules in the 1967 Act for this clause, and the purpose is to ensure that the provisions are not evaded through controlled companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no wish to prolong these proceedings, but I am puzzled at this point. I can understand that a person over the age of 18 no longer requires protection, but the purpose of this part of the Bill, as I understand it, is not to protect persons connected with directors but to protect the company and its shareholders, its creditors and, happily, I hope, after this Bill, its employees. I do not follow why they should require less protection because the person connected with the director is over the age of 18. If anything, as I would have understood it, someone over the age of 18 may be more likely to plot with a director to do something which ought to be disclosed. Therefore, the fact that one is over the age of 18 and is no longer under the control of a director does not seem to be relevant to the argument, but perhaps I am being obtuse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and learned Gentleman has raised a question of pro-
	<span class='label label-info column'>540</span>
found social significance. If he considers the matter, the previous Administration provided that this changing relationship should take place at the age of 18. It indicates that that child has become independent of the parent. That was the basis on which voting commenced at that age.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not querying any general social principle. I am not arguing whether 18 or some other age is the appropriate age. I am questioning the form of the argument. The argument seems to be that because at a particular age, whatever it may be, the child is no longer under the control of the parent, therefore people other than the family do not require protection from some collusion within the family. It is that which is puzzling me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point that the right hon. and learned Gentleman makes. I am not sure he is entitled to attach suspicion necessarily to a person over the age of 18. Over the age of 18 the child is a fully free-standing individual. If, however, the director is interested in the contract with his child, now an adult, new clause 33 requires the interest to be disclosed to the board. That is one of the changes in the nature of this provision which, I think, meets the right hon. Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) and his difficulty in understanding "nuclear family". When I was at school in his constituency, I came across the word "nucleus". I was only seven; the teacher explained that "nucleus" meant the beginning. I had to write an essay on "spring". With this new word in mind I wrote "Spring is the nucleus of the cricket season". I got a black mark. I think that the teacher should have got a black mark for not explaining it properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause gives definitions of certain terms used in the clauses on directors' conflicts of interests. As both the circumstances in which many of them have been employed and their meanings, too, have already been discussed—I am glad to say that "nuclear family" does not appear in this clause—I do not think that a detailed description is now necessary. Hon. Members will find the clause self-explanatory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Law Society appears to have made a number of points about the interpretation of the clause. The first is that the opening words of the definition of "relevant company" have been omitted in subsection (1). I think what may well have happened is that there were, in relation to some of these clauses, some typographical errors which appeared, and which appeared then to have been corrected, because we came across another version of one of the new clauses. I have not made the point previously because it did not seem to me to be of substance. Perhaps this is where the Law Society has been misled on this matter. I am putting the point because the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) seems to be the prime advocate for the Law Society and I do not want him to feel that its point of view has not been expressed here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think there may be some more substance in the second of the Law Society's criticisms in that subsection (2)(	<i>a</i>) appears to be nonsensical. How can one actually sell land under a hire-purchase agreement? In my practice at Hackney I came across many odd things, but never that. Perhaps something has gone wrong at the printers, or perhaps it was a slip on the part of the parliamentary draftsman, or perhaps someone has had
	<span class='label label-info column'>544</span>
some experience of this extraordinary kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next criticism that is made is that in order to correspond with the definition of "quasi-loan" in subsection (1) the words "or is liable" would be inserted after the word "agrees" in subsection (3)(	<i>b</i>) and the words "goods, land or services" in subsection 3(	<i>c</i>) should be "goods, services, land or other property, or any interest therein".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that there are two points of substance in the criticisms of the Law Society, which I think is, unless I have misunderstood it, misled as to the first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising these points and also to the Law Society for the assistance that it has given. If I could take first the last point raised by the hon. Gentleman with regard to new clause 36(2)(	<i>a</i>) and his question about the hire-purchase agreement for the sale of land, the definition in the Consumer Credit Act to which clause 56 refers, I am advised, limits the scope of hire-purchase agreements to goods, while the definition of "conditional sale agreement" in that Act includes land. It is intended that we should propose amendments to new clause 36(2) to ensure that the same position prevails as regards the definition of "credit transactions". I hope that that will meet the hon. Gentleman's point but I, like him, will look with great interest at the need to be absolutely sure that we get this provision right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, if I may refer to subsection (3)(	<i>b</i>), I am again grateful to the hon. Gentleman for pointing out that the words "or is liable" should be inserted after the word "agrees" in subsection 3(	<i>b</i>). I appreciate that this is a material point raised by the Law Society. I take his point and will propose the appropriate amendment on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was one other point raised by the hon. Gentleman, again to which the Law Society referred, and that was subsection (3)(	<i>c</i>). I believe that the hon. Gentleman's point is answered by the definition of "services" in subsection (1) whereby the term is defined to include "anything other than goods or land". I know that careful consideration has been given to that, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be satisfied with the answer. I assure him that we will look at it again.

	<span class='label label-info column'>545</span>
The hon. Gentleman raised a question with regard to the "relevant company". Apparently, this was omitted from the first print of the clause, and I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman should have received one of the first prints, because I am informed that it is now included. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman has been troubled unnecessarily on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I was merely reiterating something I could not understand in the Law Society's representations, so that the Law Society could have it on record that the point was taken and that the Government had an answer to it, because I could not see any sense in it.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 37 and the Government amendments supplementing it are purely consequential and do not merit much discussion. However, I should say a short word about subsection (2) of new clause 37, which has the effect of repealing the relevant disclosure provisions in the 1948 and 1967 Acts, which are superceded by the disclosure provisions in our Bill. In formulating the disclosure provisions, we did not want to introduce any element of retrospection which would require companies to disclose in their accounts any transaction or arrangement that was entered into and was completed—that is, under which no liabilities remained—before the appointed day. All such transactions were, therefore, excluded from our new disclosure provisions, but for the purpose of the accounts prepared in relation to the first financial year ending after the appointed day, it is important that any such transactions that are thus exempted from the new disclosure regime are still covered by the existing disclosure rules. Thus, the accounts for this particular financial year will be covered by two different sets Of rules. We recognise that this may be slightly burdensome for some companies for the first year of the operation of our provisions, but this is unavoidable if we wish—and this is our prime wish—the disclosure provisions to be effective from the appointed day while ruling out any element of retrospection.

tors' report of contracts in which a director has an interest, is repealed because these contracts are now required to be disclosed in the accounts. It is appropriate that all the details of transactions involving directors should appear in one place—namely in the accounts—and disclosure in the accounts of these particular contracts renders disclosure in the directors' report superfluous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are prepared to debate new clauses 11 and 12 and, indeed, other new clauses. We do not apprehend that they would take a great deal of time to debate. It might have the advantage that, since we are already here this afternoon, we might obviate a sitting one afternoon next week.

I would not suggest that we go on to inflation accounting and data and estimates, unless the hon. Member for Kensington (Sir B.

Gentleman's desire to make progress, and it is very gratifying to know that we are all of one mind in this matter. But for us to take those matters out of the present order of consideration it will require a substantive motion to be moved by somebody and for the Committee to decide thereon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I then move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That consideration of new clauses 42 to 46 be postponed until after consideration of new clauses 11, 12 and 15.</p></blockquote>
Will you accept that motion, Sir Stephen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We must dispose of these questions in the proper form. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman proposes to withdraw his motion so that we may discuss the proposal put by the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, Sir Stephen. It is my intention to maintain my motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, the Question before the Committee is, That further consideration of the Bill be now adjourned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel rather like the boxer whose manager is saying "We are quite prepared to proceed at once and we will fight any champion in the room". My hon. Friend is proposing that we should continue to the new clauses with which I was to deal. I cannot help feeling a slight sense of relief if, in fact, the Under-Secretary says that he is not ready to fight. I shall not be here on Thursday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not know that a Committee could take so long on such an issue. So that it may come to a decision, I shall now put the Question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Adjourned accordingly at twenty-seven minutes to Six o'clock till Thursday 6 December at half-past Ten o'clock.</i></p>
