</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to thank you, Miss Fookes, for selecting amendments No. 13, 14 and 15 because that selection has widened the debate. The amendments refer to subsections (3) and (4), the principle being much the same in either—that is, the proper relationship between managers and governors and local education authorities in applications to the Department of Education relating to secondary reorganisation, in this case about revocation or election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to thank the Under-Secretary of State for the information that he has provided to every member of the Committee between the two sittings. It did not reach me as soon as it should but that
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
was no fault of his; it was a blip in the House of Commons delivery system. As we are to have another Education Bill this session, it would save an enormous amount of time if, when a clause refers to detailed information such as this, that information could be provided in advance enabling hon. Members to digest it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have the document relating to areas where proposals have been approved under section 13(4) we can consider Hampshire. In that county two voluntary aided schools subject to directions under the 1976 Act are now being given revocation rights under this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
King Edward VI school, Southampton, where 20 years ago I taught Latin and Greek has decided to go independent rather than take advantage of revocation under subsection (3). Because there is no date in subsection (3), as there is in subsection (4), voluntary aided schools, such as Emanuel in London, when they go independent, theoretically remain voluntary aided schools until the last voluntary aided kid leaves the sixth form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause would appear to give, for instance, King Edward VI school, Southampton, the right in five, six or even seven years—during which time, except for a few children at the top end, it will have been mainly an independent, fee-paying school—the right simply to write to the Minister revoking and saying, "We want to be a grammar school again, with no fees, in which the local education authority is compelled to pay all our running expenditure," and by that act, to recreate an 11-plus in Southampton, where the 11-plus has not existed for years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not put a date on the revocation in subsection (3) as he has on the election in subsection (4). That seems very dangerous, particularly for the voluntary schools. Let us take Wolverhampton boys' grammar school, another school in the list. I understand from the deputy chief education officer of Wolverhampton, to whom I spoke yesterday, that the governors of the grammar school have decided—as they have every right to do—to go independent. As long as the school remains theoretically a voluntary aided school, however—for the status must theoretically remain as long as a single local authority supported voluntary aided child is in the School—the governors could, under the Bill, say in two or three years' time, "The economic climate is difficult. We want to use our revocation powers." The Minister
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0470">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
could confirm it and, at a stroke, without consultation with teachers, parents or anyone else, the 11-plus could be recreated in Wolverhampton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a voluntary school uses its right under the Bill to revoke and to revert to being a Voluntary aided grammar school, that will affect every primary school in Southampton, Wolverhampton or wherever we are talking about. Forty or 50 primary schools will have to start up a selective system which in many cases they got rid of seven, eight, nine or 10 years ago. With the Selection of the amendments, we can really look at these important matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point about amendment No. 14, which refers to subsection (3), is this. What will be the position of those voluntary aided schools which may wish at some future date to use the Bill to revoke and to recreate the 11-plus? Assurances by the Minister that the Government would not confirm the application are not enough. If the Minister really wants the Bill to pass through according to its timetable—I understand that all sorts of people think it should go through quickly; I cannot understand why but there seems to be pressure in that direction—and if he agrees that there is a problem, we need an undertaking from him to look at the matter and bring forward amendments on Report or in another place so that it can be made clear beyond peradventure that there is not a continuing power lying with voluntary schools to frustrate comprehensive education in their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 13 is identical to amendment No. 14 but refers to subsection (4). Subsection (4) is clearly not subject to the same wide possibilities as subsection (3) because the list we have been given of schools and local authorities with the right to revoke under subsection (3) runs to about I00 schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Greenway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If these clauses have been implemented, how can they be revoked without section 13? I have not completely followed the hon. Gentleman's argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could say it again. Subsection (3) refers to schemes which have gone through the 1976 procedure and have almost reached the point of implementation, either for 1979–80 or for 1981. Subsection (3) gives local education authorities or voluntary schools, or both,
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
the right to revoke if they so wish. If they do revoke there is no implementation. If they do not revoke, there is implementation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no time limit on revocation in the Bill. The Voluntary aided schools in list A—as I call it; the list which refers to clause 1(3)—can remain voluntary aided schools for a year or two to come, some for as long as six years. Therefore, it would appear—I may be wrong—that under the Bill those voluntary aided schools retain the right, while they remain voluntary aided schools or voluntary controlled schools or whatever sort of voluntary schools they are, to simply say to the Minister in 1980, 1981, 1982 or 1983, "We revoke; we would rather cease to be an independent school, as some have become, and go back to being an ordinary voluntary aided school with no fees. The local authority must recreate an 11-plus and pay all the running expenses."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This problem arises from what I call the Emanuel solution. The problem arose when a number of voluntary aided schools went independent and the local authorities wanted to put in section 13 notices to cease to maintain them. I am not absolutely certain of the exact details, but the ceasing to maintain ran over a period, because clearly the local education authority had to maintain those schools over the period that youngsters were still in the school. I want to know why no date was put on subsection (3)? Do these voluntary schools, such as King Edward VI school, Southampton, Churches college, Peters-field, and Wolverhampton boys' grammar school, continue to have rights of revocation for the next few years? I am sure that is unlikely to happen. But even if that could, theoretically, happen it should be put right in law, and revocation limited to 31 December 1979, or something like that. We should not allow the revocation rights to continue to exist over the years to come. That is my point on subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to amendment No. 13. Here the implications are not so wide because, as is made clear by the information which we are very pleased to have from the Under-Secretary, only three education authorities are involved—Cumbria, Derbyshire and North Yorkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extraordinary that every time there is a new Government one gets what I call hybrid social legislation. In passing, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0471">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
schools in Cumbria refer particularly to the constituency of the Home Secretary and that of the Government Chief Whip. Far be it from me to suggest that on the first day in government the Home Secretary wrote a little note to his Prime Minister saying, "I have promised to defend Brampton grammar school. Pray make it possible," or that the Chief Whip, on his first day in office, remembering his election commitment to Kendal grammar school, did anything so personal as to write a note to the Prime Minister saying, "Pray rush legislation through to defend Kendal grammar school." I am quite sure that we have a Home Secretary and a Chief Whip who would not dream of doing anything of the kind. But it is something of a coincidence, considering the narrow scope of subsection (4), that one whole third of it refers to the constituencies of the Chief Whip and the Home Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we had such a thing as hybrid social legislation, in the sense that we were not allowed—as we learned from the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill—to have hybrid industrial legislation, I am quite sure that this Bill would be referred to examiners, and so on, for its hybridity. Its short title ought to read "Save the Joplings and Whitelaws Bill", because that is its effect. Unfortunately, my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) has been dragged into this situation as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To illustrate the election element, I suggest a possible, though hypothetical, situation to the Under-Secretary concerning the relationship between local education authorities and voluntary bodies. For instance, we see from the list that there are two secondary modern schools in Skipton and two grammar schools—Skipton boys grammar school and Skipton girls grammar school—in a beautiful part of the Yorkshire dales, upper Wharfedale, which I know very well, having spent my holidays walking there. The two secondary modern schools are county schools and the two grammar Schools are voluntary schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that North Yorkshire came to its senses, which it may do, and, as a local education authority, said, as a result of the Bill, "We have come to our senses. We want to elect and implement the Act and use our powers of election under subsection (4)." That election could be totally frustrated under the Bill by one or other of the voluntary schools—
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
Ermysted's or Skipton—saying, "We do not want to elect and we are thereby going to frustrate the intentions of the local education authority."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Exactly the same thing could happen in the city of York about which my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Bright-side (Miss Maynard) knows a great deal more than I do. There again one has a mix of voluntary and county schools. Even if the North Yorkshire local education authority wanted to clear up this mess in York, which has gone on for so many years, even if the education committee came to its senses and voted to elect, Archbishop Holgate's grammar school, for example, one of the aided secondary schools—I suppose the primary schools are included here because it applies to a middle-school system and therefore the primary schools must be included—could refuse to elect. If only one of the primary schools refused to elect under subsection (4), the whole plan would be frustrated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter derives from the fact that, at the behest of the Home Secretary and the Chief Whip, this Bill was rushed through, I suspect against some of the advice given to the Government. It was rapidly drafted, pushed together without any thought to the consequences. It breached the time-honoured traditional legal principle in all education legislation—namely, that every time governors and local education authorities are mentioned in their approach to Ministers, there should be a linkage between them. In section 13 of the 1944 Act, governors must consult local education authorities, and they cannot obtain section 13 permission to build a new school if the local education authority has not put it in a building plan. That is laid down in legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the 1976 Act careful linkage was made between the activities of governors and the activities of local education authorities. In this Act, because it was shoved together at the last minute, this point has been completely overlooked—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first minute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first minute, as my hon. Friend said. It could cause absolute chaos in Southampton, in Petersfield, in Wolverhampton, in Skipton and in York. Those are the five places where potential disputes could occur between the local education authorities and the voluntary school bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0472">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>117</span>
I know that the Minister is anxious about this matter and I know how timetables are involved at this late stage. However, we could discuss this matter in August if necessary. I shall need some clear reassurances from the Minister that he is willing to consider amendments on Report to ensure that there is not unlimited right of revocation under subsection (3) before I feel sufficiently happy not to press these amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At our last sitting, the Under-Secretary was almost forthcoming—indeed, quite promising—in a response he made to the probing of my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price). The matter concerned the perpetuity of the right of revocation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one other point that we should make before the Minister replies to today's proceedings. In col. 107 the Minister referred to one of those "mild impasses" which could occur in the event of a different interpretation or dispute of legality, a different emphasis, a different interpretation of rights, a different political complexion, or if for any other reason there might be a difference of opinion in these maters between managers or governors and the local education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Obviously, they could apply for revocation under the Bill. If the local education authority opposed that, a decision would have to be taken by the Secretary of State."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> Standing Committee A; 3 July 1979, c.107.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman undertook to give a longer answer, but I think he will recognise that the manner in which the Secretary of State would give consideration—the criteria on which he would judge in the dispute between the LEA and the goVernors—is of crucial importance to the Bill. I hope that in the course of his remarks he will, as he has promised, give a pretty close definition of how he would recommend the Secretary of State to approach these matters, since this is going to have a direct effect on the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Education and Science (Dr. Rhodes Boyson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a considerable debate on amendment No. 6, on which amendments Nos. 13 and 14 have some bearing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole point behind the Govern-
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
ment's thinking here is to return the position, in principle and in practice, to what it was before 1976. Between 1944 and 1976, a change in a voluntary School could take place only with the agreement of that school. The only thing that a local education authority could do—this deals with various points raised this morning by the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price)—was to withdraw recognition. If a school was to remain within the State sector and be maintained by it, there was nothing it could do to change its organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does the Minister mean by "withdraw recognition"? As I understand it, the only power under the law which local education authorities have over voluntary schools is to apply under section 13 to the Minister to cease to maintain. Is his term "withdraw recognition" a kind of shorthand for that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. All they can do is cease to maintain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Apply to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes—apply to cease to maintain. That is all they can do. They cannot change the composition of the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1976 Act changed the pattern because it allowed local education authorities to put through schemes. Once those schemes were accepted by the Minister, he could enforce them. In drafting the Bill, we were concerned to return the position of Voluntary schools—not only from the important educational viewpoint but also because of the dispersal of power within a society—to that which existed from 1944 to 1976. If the amendment were to be accepted, the pressure on voluntary schools would be worse than under the 1976 Act. The Bill is basically a repeal Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to a second Education Bill. I take the first point he made about the need for information to be widely distributed before discussion of a clause. That will be done before the second Bill because such distribution of information does help discussion of specific cases under the terms of an Act, as has been the case with this Bill. I repeat that this is a repeal Bill to return the situation to what it was prior to 1976.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would make two points here. If a local authority presented a scheme, it had to be presented separately from those for vol-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0473">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
untary schools, unless schemes were presented jointly. They could not be part of a local authority's scheme for its maintained schools. There had to be two sets of section 13 notices, one for Voluntary schools and one for county schools. Since 1976 local education authorities consulted because there was a requirement to do so, and I accept that. But the basic issue is not the requirements to consult—which can mean a lot or a little, as we all know in Various fields of political life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were concerned to put back the right of decision, not merely the right of consultation. This Bill gives back the right of decision to the control of voluntary schools. That includes basically the right of revocation. If a scheme is presented and not implemented—I am thinking of points raised by the hon. Gentleman this morning—it can be revoked, which could not have happened under the 1976 Act, because the Act gave the Minister power actually to enforce a plan once it had been accepted in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing new here; we are reverting entirely to the situation that existed before 1976. That was our intention, although I accept that there is a difference of view in the Committee. It is a total reversion of the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister accept that there are situations where one cannot turn the clock back? Statutory things have happened between 1976 and 1979. Teachers have been appointed, jobs have been carried out, alterations have taken place in schools, section 13 notices have been accepted, pupils have been allocated to different schools. The Minister accepts under subsection (4) that the clock cannot be completely turned back with interim provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I ask the Minister—it is not a great deal—is to consider coming forward with some sort of interim provisions in subsection (3) as well as subsection (4) rather than talking in terms of absolutely turning back the clock—which is quite impossible in certain circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.00 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying, we can turn back the clock under legislation and put the situation, where schemes have not been implemented, back to where it was. That was what we said we would do in our manifesto and our speeches and that is what we have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
The hon. Gentleman may disagree with what we have done, as may any hon. Members, but we have done what we said we would do—we have put the situation back to give the freedom to voluntary schools to continue as they wish as ling as They are accepted in some way within the state sector. I know the problems which this has caused in inner London as I worked in inner London for many years, as the hon. Gentleman knows. However, the intention of the Bill, to which we are committed, is to put the situation back to where it was at that particulars time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this issue it as well to remember that many of these schemes were put through despite the disagreement of the voluntary schools concerned. Presumably, that is what concerns the hon. Gentleman</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, but some were. The hon. Gentleman says that we cannot make legislation because there are certain schemes that do not fit in. I could go through a list. We should have to go back to see what objections were put up at that time but from the response now we know that a number of those voluntary schools objected then, as they object now, to the schemes that were being put through. The interesting thing is that at that time they were not allowed to object, as the then Minister approached the matter, to stop these schemes being put through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Eastham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does the Minister know that the people still object now, since he is not going back for further consultation? For all we know, now that they have had time to digest the matter and adjust to the future proposals, there may have been a complete change of attitude and they may want to go forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That intervention was very helpful, because if the hon. Member is right, there is no need to worry about any of the amendments from his side of the Committee. If his side of the Committee believes that the voluntary schools were so pleased with the schemes that have been implemented in their areas that they will now go along with them, then we have all wasted our time in many hours of discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we know that some object because they have since said that they have objected. I am sure that the hon. Member for Lewisham, West knows this, which is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0474">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
why he has raised his points this morning. Obviously, if I follow the line of the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Mr. Eastham) correctly, there is nothing for the other side of the Committee to worry about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the Under-Secretary agree that in the instance in North Yorkshire which was referred to, where the primary schools also were involved, when a scheme is going ahead, where all the secondary schools and State primary schools are in favour of it but one voluntary aided primary school is against it, such a school, if this goes through, can sabotage the whole thing? The Under-Secretary is saying that the veto should be there for the one voluntary school which does not like the proposals even though everyone else within the area now accepts them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very interested in this discussion, because I had always considered that the Labour Party was concerned about minority rights. Now we have emotive words like "sabotage" because a minority says, "We were established as a school to operate in a certain way, money was raised to set up the school in a certain way and, we wish to continue in the same way." That is now called "sabotage". Parliamentary majorities are elected but both parties must be aware—minority rights are often mentioned by hon. Members opposite—that this is a case of minority rights which is disliked by hon. Members opposite because they do not like the decisions that will be made by those governing bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to disappoint the optimistic view of the hon. Member for Blackley, but some of these voluntary schools do object. The hon. Members for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett) and Lewisham, West have raised the point because there is a difference of view between the two sides of the Committee on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On this enthusiasm for minorities, when will the hon, Gentleman let this side of the Committee, which is in the minority, get one amendment through?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we were convinced as reasonable men on this side of the Committee—I am sure that the hon. Member for Stockport, North, who is a very
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
reasonable man on the Opposition side of the Committee, will agree—that if an amendment would strengthen the Bill, we should be delighted to accept it. It is perhaps a little late for amendments now, but if I could have made this offer on Tuesday I should have been interested to see whether an amendment could be moved from the Opposition side which would strengthen our purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the difference between our views is on the difference of purpose of the Bill. The hon. Member for Lewisham, West raised certain technical points to which I shall return, but in these clauses there is a difference of viewpoint on the position of the voluntary schools within the schooling system of this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Under-Secretary's pledge that certain amendments might have his blessing. But does he not agree that amendments which are fundamentally about consultation among governors and LEAs, parents and teachers, in the whole educational context, are strengthening and not weakening amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not necessarily agree. I am trying to find points of agreement this morning with the hon. Member for Lewisham, West, but I find it difficult to take that fully on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If consultation is done with free men who know that it is up to them to say yes or no, that is genuine consultation. But in this case, under the 1976 Act, it was not genuine consultation: the Voluntary school knew that, however much it objected, schemes would be put up and plans put through and implemented. I do not consider that that is genuine consultation. Genuine consultation takes place when there is no gun in the back. The 1976 Act was the gun in the back of the voluntary schools, which said, "Co-operate or else."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They agreed to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They also agreed to this Bill, in which case the hon. Gentleman must be with me this morning. There has been no objection by the voluntary schools to this Bill. As far as I understand their position from the material which has come in, the voluntary schools are happy about the return of their powers under the Bill. But this is a difference of opinion. We could go on all morning on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0475">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
The hon. Member for Stockport, North is right in that, if one voluntary school decides that it does not want to come in on the arrangements made, it can revoke. On the other hand, I should mention the remaining power. There have been cases in London—I am going back to technicalities here—of ceasing to maintain, and there is a reserve power to a local authority. But it is only a reserve power. It does not have the immediacy of the 1976 Act, under which schools knew they had to agree almost immediately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the Minister's comment about the reaction he has had from the voluntary schools, since he has obviously been in communication with them or they with him, or at least with his Department, can he tell us whether he has given any advice to those who have corresponded with him to the effect that, in anticipation of the eventual enactment of the Bill, they could take a certain course of action? Or are we to believe that until, or if, Royal Assent is received to the Bill, those authorities which have communicated with him, whether governors, managers or local education authorities, will make no move towards the implementation of the effects of the Bill in their local areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The House cannot condition what people are doing outside. I know that often, before Bills have become Acts, even people inside the House have made provisions. If I remember rightly, money was spent on Assembly buildings in Scotland and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I voted against that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I respect the hon. Gentleman for that, but, in spite of the higher Views which he and I may hold on that matter, we are dealing with the run of mankind. I should imagine that people outside have followed the publication of the Bill, because it has caused some interest, as have the debates in Committee, and they have decided that it is likely to become law because of the Conservative majority. I should have been very surprised if they had not made temporary arrangements about what they intend to do when the Bill becomes law. Therefore the answer is yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Except that the substance of my question—perhaps I did not put it too well—was whether the hon. Gentleman, in response to the correspondence he
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
has clearly received, has given any advice to those who have corresponded with him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given no advice to any of those who have corresponded with me. Presumably they are making their own arrangements with the local authorities, but to my knowledge—and certainly from me—no guidance has been given to them. I am sorry that I did not answer that correctly. I was interested in the other point and was a little carried away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now move to the technical points which were made by the hon. Member for Lewisham, West and the reference to Hampshire. Where there is a "cease to maintain" notice, and it has been accepted, that cannot be revoked by the voluntary body—the school. The only body that can apply to remaintain, if I may use the term loosely, is the local authority. Once a school has begun to become independent, therefore, it is independent so far as that is concerned from that day, and it cannot itself apply to come back inside the State sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of fact, is the Minister saying that, in the case of both schools in Hampshire, both "cease to maintain" notices have already been confirmed by him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the details of whether I had or not. I was raising the point. It was on the principles of the Bill that I was talking, not the details, but under this Bill if a school wanted to come back inside the State sector, the school itself could not decide. Only the local authority could decide to remaintain it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister cannot have it both ways. The implication of what he said—I may be wrong—is that the voluntary aided schools which I mentioned as perhaps exercising their right, for example in Hampshire, to which I drew particular attention, have gone through the business of a "cease to maintain" notice and have had the notice confirmed by his right hon. Friend. If that is the case, why does he include them in a list of areas where approvals are affected by clause 1(3)? He cannot have it both ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Reference has been made to Report stage and I appreciate that. As I understand it, under Clause 1(3) proposals have been accepted and approved under section 13(4). As far as I understand it, that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0476">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
has already happened in the case of the schools with which we are concerned. If that is so, the desire to remaintain can be taken only by the local authority and not by the governing body of the school. That is my understanding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I just clear this up finally? Perhaps we shall have to come back to it on Report and get it really cleared up. Is the Minister saying that, in all the cases I mentioned, the section 13 notice linked to the 1976 Act in each case was a "cease to maintain" notice rather than a "going comprehensive" notice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That happened under the previous Government, and one must appreciate who was involved in it then. My understanding is that that would have happened under the previous Government when it came up. I shall have checks made on that so that in discussion later we may make it perfectly clear. I should be Surprised if the hon. Gentleman's Government, in view of the prodding they must have had from the hon. Member himself, did not take that action at the time but left a loose end that we have inherited. I presume that the previous Government did not leave that loose end, but we shall certainly find out before the next stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the second point that was made, any implication to revoke must be made before the date of implementation of a scheme. Once a scheme is implemented, there can be no revocation. In certain cases the date of implementation is 1979, in certain cases 1980 or 1981. Schemes can, presumably, be revoked up to the day of implementation, but once they have been implemented, there can be no revocation. I mention that because of the question of the seven-year or eight-year run.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a similar situation with direct grant schools where some children are still going through the schools. But my understanding of the Bill is that, once a decision of the Minister on what has come up to him is implemented, there can he no revocation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister qualified what seemed to be a firm statement that there could be no revocation after the date of implementation by the word "presumably", implying that presumably revocation could be sought only up to the date
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
of implementation. Does that not add great force to the plea of my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price) that such matters should be specified in the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only basis on which we can work on implementation is the dates of implementation agreed under the 1976 Act. They have legal force in that sense, but they do not have the force or, indeed, the public notice—I am using the phrase "public notice" not in the context of the 1944 Act but as a colloquialism—or the public attention that would be drawn to them by the insertion in the Bill of the provision that the power to seek revocation would lapse on such-and-such a date, or on the date under which implementation would have taken place under the 1976 Act. In that way, everyone would know what time scale was meant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that undertaking is not included, and the Bill is enacted without that undertaking, the presumption will always exist—despite what the Minister has said, though of course we accept the force of his word—that revocation is a permanent facility available to those bodies which, in certain economic or social circumstances, could consider themselves to be advantaged by seeking revocation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the Minister's position not be strengthened, if such an application ever came in, by an undertaking, to be presented for inclusion as a further subsection of the Bill at a later stage, that there was a timetable for revocation which could not be exceeded because it formed part of the Education Act 1979?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since the Minister might want to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not like one intervention upon another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come in later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To deal with the intervention of the honourable Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock), an application for revocation can be successful only if it happens before the date of implementation. I shall say not "presumably" but "clearly". It must happen before the date of implementation. That is the total understanding of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Government want the Bill, they should give some pledges that will make that point crystal clear by writing words into the Bill to that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0477">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
effect on Report. I hope that the Minister will be able to give such a pledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I make one other point? The Minister said that there was no going back on "cease to maintain" notices. However, subsection (3) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where any proposals to which this subsection applies have been approved under subsection (4) of section 13, the Secretary of State may, on the application of the local education authority, managers or governors concerned, revoke the approval."</p></blockquote>
These words seem to mean that, if he has confirmed the "cease-to-maintain" notice on King Edward VI school, Southampton, or Wolverhampton boys grammar school, on application of the school, the Minister can revoke his confirmation of those section 13 notices. Is he saying that my understanding of the wording of the Bill is wrong?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The probing questioning of the honourable Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price) has been incisive this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, once a "cease to maintain" notice has been applied to a school only the local authority itself can reverse it. The governing body of the school cannot do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is true, the statement the Minister just made appears to run completely counter to the words in the Bill. The Minister may be right—I do not know. But if he wants the Bill out of Committee today he must give a pledge that he will put the words he has just used into legislative form on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where the Bill does not specify, the 1944 Act still applies. The point is an interpretation of the 1944 Act. Once there has been a "cease to maintain" notice, and the school concerned has left the State sector, it can only be brought back by an application of the local authority itself. That does not need any change. As I understand it, that has been the law since 1944, and we have not changed that law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I come back to this? Clause 1(3) of the Bill refers to subsection (4) of section 13 of the Education Act 1944 which, to the best of my memory—I do not have Taylor and Saunders in front of me—refers to the right of the Secretary of State to approve applications. If that approval is revoked, presumably the "cease to maintain"
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
notice is revoked, and the school again becomes a maintained school. I cannot see what revocation means, unless it means that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 1(3) applies only to schemes that have been put up and approved, but not implemented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The same would apply if a local authority wanted to make a change. The situation under the 1944 Act remains. The revocation can clearly be made at that stage by the local authority or, provided it has not been implemented, by the voluntary school governors themselves. But once it has been implemented the voluntary school governors cannot revoke it. The school has ceased to be maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are a number of different applications under section 13, as the Under-Secretary of State knows. Under the 1976 Act two of the types of application made were, first, what I call a comprehensive section 13 application to change the character of a school, and second, an application to cease to maintain a school. Confirmation of a change in the character of a school under section 13, linked to the 1976 Act, can clearly be revoked under the Bill. The Under-Secretary appears to be saying that one kind of section 13 notice can be revoked under the Bill, but that another kind of section 13 notice cannot be revoked under the Bill. If that is what he means, he should include it in legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to write it into the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me rephrase my remarks. If a "cease to maintain" notice has been accepted and implemented, and the school has ceased to be maintained, there is no way in which the governing body of the school can bring the school back into the maintained sector. That can be done only by the local authority. At least we are clear on both sides on that issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christohper Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not clear. If that is the case, what does revocation of a section 13 "cease to maintain" notice mean? What effect does revocation of a section 13 "cease to maintain" notice have?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A "cease to maintain" notice can come only from a local educa-

	<span class='label label-info column'>129</span>
tion authority, and it can be revoked only by a local education authority. That is why it is different from all the other proposals under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not say so? We could go on like this for ever. I am trying to obtain from the Under-Secretary something provided by every other Minister on every Standing Committee of which I have been a member. The Under-Secretary seems to be under gauleiter orders from above not to make any pledges regarding reconsideration on Report. It is a clear muddle. As he appears to be saying that Section 13 "cease to maintain" notices cannot be revoked but that change of character "cease to maintain" notices can, will he undertake to table an amendment on Report to make the position clear?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not say there is a clear muddle over this; the debate this morning should have clarified the matter and the interpretation will be studied by future students when the Bill becomes law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Lewisham, West was correct to say that two factors affect voluntary schools. If it is a question of a change of character of any school within the maintained sector the voluntary school governors can apply for revocation. But if it is a "cease to maintain" notice which can be made only by a local education authority, whatever the wishes of the school concerned, it can be revoked only by the local education authority. That is not, basically, a change of law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept all that. The Minister has already given that explanation three or four times. I am saying that the words in the Act could be otherwise read. Education is litigated about more now than ever before. The hon. Gentleman is saying that subsection (3) means that local education authorities may apply to have only local education authority applications revoked and that managers and governors may apply to have only managers' and governors' applications revoked. But that is not what the words mean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As subsection (3) stands, managers and governors might be held to be able to apply to have revoked a section 13 notice which, although made by the local education authority, refers to them as managers and governors in a "cease to maintain"
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
notice. I am asking the Under-Secretary to give a pledge such as are given by Ministers every day in Committee that he will take this back, bringing forward an amendment on Report and make the matter clear. I do not know why the Under-Secretary has been so obstinate and has wasted nearly half an hour of a Committee sitting when the Government wish to get the Bill out of Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The interpretation of the subsection seems perfectly clear to me; in fact, clearer now than when we began our debate. I believe that what I am saying is legally correct. If I am wrong I shall come back on Report. However, I assure the hon. Member for Lewisham, West that I shall check that the correct interpretation is that agreed by us both and see whether it is clear enough in the Bill to be understood when it becomes law. If it is not clear, it will be rectified on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I raised a further question which became a matter of importance as a consequence of the hon. Gentleman's statement in clause 107. Is the hon. Gentleman now in a position to say what the reaction might be in the event of an "impasse", whether mild or severe?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The situation to which the hon. Member for Bedweilty (Mr. Kinnock) refers was common between 1944 and 1976. On this there is a long case law. The advantage was that there had to be genuine consultation between the local authority and the voluntary bodies because neither could compel the other. Apart from areas such as London, which had reached an impasse at that time, one cannot say how decisions would be made. That would depend upon the Secretary of State for this was back under section 13 then. The situation was not very different. If proposals and objections come to the Secretary of State, he must decide whether to carry out the wishes of the local education authority. It may not happen. We have checked what is likely to happen in such local authorities but we are given no guidance as to what they are likely to do. I do not think that an impasse would arise. There is only one place where it is likely to arise and that is the one mentioned this morning by the hon. Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it did happen, the situation of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0479">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
Minister making the decision would be no different from that between 1974 and 1976. He would have to decide on the merits of the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Except that the Minister says that the only desire of the Bill is to return the situation in principle and practice to that which existed between 1974 and 1976—I think I quote him exactly—and that is not possible. My hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price) reminded us earlier that time marches on—or some similarly profound cliche and I think that the Minister got the message. Governments march on as well. Indeed, Governments sometimes march backwards. I have the profound feeling that that is exactly what this Government are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the fact remains that because of the atmosphere in which the Bill is being introduced and because of the motivation of the Bill—I mean not a purist decision to attempt to return to the halcyon pre-1976 days, but the commitments made by the Government with increasing intensity during the years between 1974 and 1979, during the time after the present Prime Minister ceased to be Secretary of State for Education and Science—it has become apparent that the attitude of the Conservative Party to the role of Government now in 1979, in arbitrating either in mild impasses, as the Minister has put it, or in disputes over whether a "cease to maintain" application should be granted, or in the interpretation of an application under subsection (3), might not be entirely the same as on previous occasions in the 1950s or in the earlier part of the 1970s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very difficult to accept that the principles involved and the criteria exercised when there is a dispute between the governors or managers and the LEA will be implemented in the same dispassionate way as they were in a less heated period in educational debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not make a debating point, because it is important that we analyse—I am sure that the Minister is proud of the political purposes of the Bill; there is no reason why he should not be, holding the beliefs that he does—and make that assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When disputes arise, with the facility given to managers and governors for creating dispute under subsection (3) in the event of a local education authority not concurring with the view of those governors and managers, we feel that the Secretary of
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
State will be coming down very firmly on the side of the managers and governors. This is important to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that there will be educational and other considerations, possibly of public finance, but we cannot believe that the people who have given birth to this Bill have the same attitude as those who presided over education between 1951 and 1964, and even between 1970 and 1974. Because of that, we have tried in our amendments to include in the Bill considerations which would give some reassurance that in the event of managers and governors making an application for revocation the prospect of a dispute would be short-circuited in the place where, most reasonably and preferably, that dispute should be resolved—that is to say, at local level—by awarding to the local education authority the ability to frustrate those odd managers and governors whose attitude is eccentric to the general attitude towards secondary education in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty is that, unless that provision can be made, we will end up with an archipelago of selective schools in areas where the attitude of the local education authority and of the overwhelming majority of parents—and indeed of a substantial majority of the teachers—is against their existence. If within that archipelago we return to the pre-1976 situation, as my honourable Friend says, we do not merely permit the survival within the maintained sector of schools which were either being forced to become comprehensive or had avoided the comprehensive mood by going independent; we also retain in those areas that have professed their opposition to selective education the necessity to keep selective education. That is why it does not return to the 1976 experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1944 to 1976 experience was one of a continual and gradual move towards reduction of selection. That has been acknowledged by the Under-Secretary and by his right honourable Friend the Secretary of State. Indeed, it has been commented upon favourably. Much credit has been claimed—rightly so—for the fact that this frequently happened in areas not only of occasional Conservative control but of perpetual Conservative domination. Every credit is deserved of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But this is not now the situation. There was a gradual move towards comprehensive education and an attempt was made by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0480">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>133</span>
my right hon. and hon. Friends in the last Government to accelerate that process. That provoked reaction in certain areas, but it was on the way to being resolved by the implementation of the 1976 Act. What this Bill does is not simply return the position to the pre-1976 environment, but enable the whole battle of comprehensive education, which was fought in the localities, to receive the alliance of Her Majesty's Government on the side of those who want to stop the gradual and insistent move towards non-selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why the situation is so different and why we would like an undertaking on—or at least consideration of—the amendments, because they do not permit the frustration of the move towards non-selective secondary education by governors and managers in areas where, by securing permission to revoke, by accomplishing that end, under the Bill they can frustrate the whole movement towards comprehensive education in an area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not have just the simple purpose which the Under-Secretary has expressed. I hope, therefore, that he will give even more serious consideration not only to allaying our fears—in many ways we are the least important people in the whole debate—but also to giving assurances to those people who are most affected, namely, the parents, and, most especially their children and the teachers children. What is wanted is an absolutely unequivocal assurance that the possibility of frustrating a non-selective scheme does not remain with the managers and governors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Naturally I would disagree if it was a local education authority which sought revocation. We would dispute the relative authority for, or the acceptability of, an LEA doing so. But it is absolutely clear that, although we might disagree with an authority's intention to seek revocation, an LEA has, for any number of reasons, a much greater right to do so, as the representative body of all parents in an area, as a body charged with the responsibility of securing the interests of all the children in an area, than the managers or governors of odd schools in an area. Some managers or governors are eccentric to the general trend, belief and hopes of the people in their area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a simple matter for the hon. Gentlemen to give that undertaking
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
and to include it in the Bill so that the managers and governors can not contradict the general feeling by securing revocation, and the Secretary of State cannot be presented with the temptation to find in favour of managers and governors, when local education authorities which want those schools to become part of the comprehensive system, or not to be part of the maintained sector, seek permission to cease to maintain. The only way to have that kind of reassurance is for the hon. Gentlemen to reconsider the matter or to accept an amendment along those lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to be helpful, as I always try to be. Everything centres around the meaning of the word "concerned" in subsections (3) and (4). The meaning of the word is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the local education authority, managers or governors"</p></blockquote>
who issued the section 13 notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where a local education authority issues a section 13 notice to cease to maintain a voluntary school, an ordinary judge construing this in an ordinary way might allow that Voluntary school to say that the meaning of the word "concerned" meant not only "which issued the application" but also "to whom the application applies".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State assures us that it does not mean that. I hesitate once more to cast doubt on the legal excellence of the advice flowing from within the portals of Elizabeth House, but they have not always been right in the past. I put it no higher than that. If the clause referred to local education authority, managers or governors who made the section 13 notice, instead of "concerned" in subsections (3) and (4), we might be able to make progress. If we had an undertaking along those lines that it will be spelled out in terms on Report we might be able to resolve the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bedwellty raised a point which is not so much a legal point, but rather a matter of the climate of opinion in which legislation is interpreted. That applies to all law in this country. An Act must be made so that it does not need to be re-made when there is a change in the climate of opinion four or five years later. The hon. Gentlemen referred to the change of climate. Indeed, when one sees the statements about the Schools Council today, one realises there has been a change of climate regarding education, and not just on the Govern-

	<span class='label label-info column'>135</span>
ment Benches, over the past few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Between 1944 and 1976 there were disputes from time to time but by and large in vast areas of the country agreement was made with voluntary authorities about changes that were desired and the manner in which they should be brought about. One of the sad things about the 1976 Act was that it acted as a great divide. The hon. Gentleman himself said that many times it could cause a reaction the other way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But any Secretary of State in the future making decisions will do so within the interpretation of public opinion at that time. Any Government that totally ignored public opinion would have a serious reaction at the ballot box. I do not think that one can tie the Bill down any more. It passes the freedom to the present Secretary of State or to any succeeding Secretary of State, as was the case previously, to make a decision where there is a clash of viewpoint between the voluntary school governors and the local education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But behind all this, as I began to say earlier, there is a difference of approach as to the degree to which the independence of the voluntary schools—which I am sure Labour Members will agree play a vital part of our society—must be defended in the Bill. That is why we are putting the position back to where it was before 1976, and that represents a difference of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for which governors are applying,—like the hon. Gentleman I spent a long time, as a non-lawyer, looking at Education Acts and their application—my understanding is that they are those who were involved at the beginning. The control is spelled out in clause 1(2). From then onwards the meaning is as it is there. Subsection (2) refers to proposals
	<br><blockquote><p>"by a local education authority under subsection (1) or by the managers or govenors of a voluntary school under subsection (2)."</p></blockquote>
That is the interpretation and it is followed throughout.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my interpretation of that provision—I must be frank—I have had to depend upon legal advice. We are not making law in that sense. If anything is wrong, the courts will decide, but I trust that there is nothing wrong which they will have to decide. My interpretation is that the governing bodies which applied for revocation are those which were involved in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the advice which the hon. Gentleman has received, which is that the word "concerned" in Subsections (3) and (4) is totally defined in subsection (2) and that no court, according to the advice the hon. Gentleman has received, could interpret the statute in any other way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But what I am making, in all the circumstances of the Government's desire to get the Bill through, is a perfectly reasonable request. I am asking that that intention—that there should be no right by managers and governors to apply to revoke a section 13 notice made by a local education authority—should be spelled out in subsections (3) and (4), so that on Report it becomes absolutely clear, when the Bill goes back to the House, what the situation is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman is genuinely concerned about this matter. I shall have this point checked and if there is any legalistic doubt—there have been times when the law has had to be redone—that it does not mean exactly what I have said, we shall bring the matter back on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 7, in page 2, line 11, leave out "1979" and insert "1980".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a straightforward amendment in keeping with our general attitude during the course of the Bill of seeking improvement by taking the Government at their word. The amendment seeks to persuade them to apply in the Bill as firmly as possible the principle that, in the event of the change of revocation taking place, a facility should exist for local opinion to demonstrate that that is the course of action wanted. It is not possible for such a procedure to be exhausted by 1 October 1979, and several questions arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the date of 1 October 1979 appears to bear no relationship to any kind of educational calendar that I, or anyone else as far as I can make out, has ever known. It would be interesting to know why 1 October 1979 has been chosen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that the Minister is scribbling and, therefore, I presume that he is either about to tell me or about to find out that information, but in its absence I can only muse on the view that such a date has been chosen because it is very close at hand and, therefore, will give little opportunity—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0482">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>137</span>
indeed, it will present a great difficulty—for those local education authorities which seek to elect for the continuation of a nonselective system or its continued implementation. Since the Bill was published—let alone since Second Reading, let alone from now on and certainly let alone after any possible date for Royal Assent—the time available for the sort of consultation which should be undertaken is very short. Indeed, I would say that there is an undemocratically and inefficiently short time between the eventual granting of any Royal Assent for the Bill and 1 October 1979. That means that the confusion and indetermination which could exist will be great.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I put as a priority in these matters the situation in which the parents, school children and teachers who are affected may be placed. Given the time of year and the fact that the schools in areas with which we are concerned will probably be ending this term in about the third week of this month and will be on vacation until the first week in September; given that in the tradition of local authorities—I do not know whether it is a good or bad tradition, but it is a tradition—that meetings do not take place in that month; given the further difficulty that school managers, governors and local education authority relevant committees do not meet systematically on a month to month basis and are unlikely to be meeting in August—indeed, many of them will not be meeting in the first half of September—the possibility that a local education authority, enthusiastic about the idea of going ahead with its non-selective secondary education scheme, can satisfy the requirement of the Bill and get its election to the Secretary of State before 1 October 1979 is very remote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter is raised by the way in which subsection (4) has been drawn. The distinction between subsections (3) and (4) is that in order to revoke, an application has to be made. But if an authority has not got to the stage—or is beyond the stage—of giving public notice under the 1944 Act, in order to curtail, indeed, in order to sabotage—I use the word again—or to kill off any schemes for the progress of comprehensive education in its area, all it has to do is nothing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, there is an imbalance in the treatment of local authorities between subsections (3) and (4) and there is unfairness in that those who want to continue
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
with their schemes from the point of public notice have the awkward imposition upon them of having to make their election before 1 October. That, to say the least, is a little inconsiderate of the parents' desires, the children's needs and the administrative arrangements of the local education authorities concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, we have the opportunity without any exact date provided in the Bill. Although we are now led to understand that the effective date for the opportunities existing under subsection (3) is the original date of implementation, it is not specified in the Bill, so there is a different treatment of education authorities in their attitude on progressing towards the abolition of selective education in their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one of the reasons we approached the Bill with distrust, not of the Minister but of the motivations and a certain circumspection as regards his otherwise bald and apparently innocent statement, repeatedly made, that the Government seek only to return to the situation which prevailed before 1976. To an extent, that is what is being attempted, but in every way possible—by inducement, imposition of administrative requirements, the insertion of a date in one case and no date in another, the fact that an education authority which is only at public notice Stage can opt out by doing nothing, by not having a meeting, by not consulting, by not having to engage in any administrative or political decision—it is made easy for a local authority to opt out. But if the local education authority wants to continue, it must go, in a very short time, through a tortuous but necessary administrative and political procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is difficult to believe that in those circumstances the Bill is as evenhanded as the Minister would have us believe. Clearly the purpose of the Bill is twofold. First, it is to provide as many opportunities as possible for those managers, and governors, and education authorities until the Minister advises or legislates to the contrary, who want to conform to the general principle, not of freedom but of avoiding comprehensive education and maintaining selective education, to do so with considerable ease. But those local education authorities which want to continue with non-selective, education, or with their plans for non-selective education, will be able to fulfill their hopes only with considerable difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0483">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>139</span>
That is the difference between the opting out of non-selective education and the requirement of opting in, or of remaining with the option of continuing non- selective education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given another year, and bearing in mind that some of the cases affected under subsection (3) will have not only a year but, in some cases, two years, or even longer, to reflect on whether they want to seek revocation, it is only fair that we give considerably longer to those authorities to deliberate, and to consult parents and teachers on the question whether they want to make an election under subsection (4). It is impossible for that to be adequately undertaken before 1 October 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition had been well advised by me and held the General Election in October 1978 and in the unfortunate event even then, of the Conservatives winning, and had we been debating the Bill in December 1978 instead of in early July 1979 it would have been difficult to make the same argument about the closure date for election. Not only would they be many more months, but the months concerned would be more convenient for educational administration, consultation with parents and communication of decisions to those parents, teachers and school children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we are now in July and the date specified is I October 1979. I plead with the Minister, in the name of fairness and of even-handedness, and to give some assistance to those who are, once again, pledged into the vexed debate about whether they should continue with their non-selective education plans, that the date be extended if not until October 1980, as our amendment suggests, certainly for six or nine months longer to give a reasonable time in which this important decision about whether to elect or not can be taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the amendment. My party has discussed the dating of this provision. The hon. Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock) asked whether there was anything magic about October. He told us of the disastrous effect of the present Leader of the Opposition not choosing last October for the general election, so it is a month which has certain advantages for the Conservative Party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's intention was to get the
	<span class='label label-info column'>140</span>
situation cleared up as quickly as possible in areas that had not wanted to go comprehensive and had been compelled to do so, so that parents, teachers and governors would know their position. Any longer delay than this date would mean that some authorities might delay. Not many are involved—we shall come to them later—but some authorities might delay their decision and there would be a sense of insurgency among the parents, teachers and pupils concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is quite simple for an authority wanting to continue, to say yes. If, under the 1976 Act—indeed, had it been done without the Act—a local authority decided to go comprehensive and was happy with those plans, then it would be perfectly straightforward for it to say yes. The only authorities which are going to say no are the authorities which did not like being compelled to go comprehensive. It is perfectly simple for them to say no, provided there is one cycle of committees. The date was fixed to allow for one cycle of committees. It was the intention to have one full cycle. This is not something about which they need to muse for a long time. If they want to continue they can say yes, and can opt in without the slightest difficulty; if they want to say no they can do so at an early date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The three authorities concerned are Derbyshire, Cumbria and North Yorkshire. Derbyshire will, I believe, decide to go ahead, so it has probably made up its mind to say yes; Cumbria, which does not like it, will probably say no. I do not think there are any problems connected with Derbyshire and Cumbria. Information from outside the House leads me to believe that they will decide once the Bill receives Royal Assent. We should like their decision so that we can clear up the uncertainties in their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only problem arises in North Yorkshire in one authority. It is probably only in the York area. If they decide to go ahead, and building and finances are required, it appears that it will be 1982 at least before they can say yes and put this scheme in. It is not a matter requiring long debate on whether it should be done this year or not. They can say yes and the date can be specified after—it is merely a question of date—or, if not happy with the situation, they can say no and go back to the authority and work out a plan, as I believe Cumbria wants to do, to fit in with the wishes of the people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0484">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>141</span>
We are dealing with conjecture here, but conjecture goes on on both sides—the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price) has conjectured very finely this morning—but it appears, from information that I have received, that voluntary schools in York will say no. Therefore, the sooner we know what the situation is there the better they can have a settlement and form alternative plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have thought a long time about the date but, knowing that only one authority in the area at the most is concerned, it seems better to hold to the actual date, knowing that there are already objections to the plan and that somebody will say no, instead of making the date either December this year, which we thought about, or October next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the authorities concerned had said that they wanted more time, we would have considered the matter immediately, but we have not been given that impression. The problem is likely to arise in only one authority but I do not think we can put back the date just for that authority, particularly as it must make up its mind pretty quickly what it intends to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that, although the committee cycle in many local education authorities is usually monthly, although it is moving now towards three- and four-month committee cycles—we are here discussing York, and the Bill is hybrid to that extent—the managers and governors of voluntary schools normally meet only once a term? The Minister said that he had been in contact with the managers and governors of the four voluntary schools involved and had information that they will probably not elect. Would he not agree that, as a result of the discussions we have had so far, the Bill has turned out to be immensely more complicated than some people thought it would be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Managers of voluntary schools are not legal experts and they need time to sit down to consider the Bill if it receives the Royal Assent. To ask managers and governors to meet within the first three weeks of term to take a decision about election, rather than giving them a little more time for mature consideration and consultation with their local education authority officers is rushing things a bit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he knows that they will not elect, but as he implies that
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
it applies only to York, it sounds as though he has named a very early date in the hope that the voluntary schools will throw the scheme over. There may be a difference of opinion between Archbishop Holgate's grammar school, which clearly wishes to remain as a grammar school if it possibly can, and some of the primary—soon to become middle—voluntary schools in York which might like to become comprehensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of the voluntary schools cycle, which is a three-times-a-year cycle, rather than a monthly cycle, does he not think that his date is rushing it a bit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can add very little to what I said earlier. I am sure that there are such things as special meetings. Like the hon. Gentleman I have served in local government for many years and know that many special meetings were called on important matters such as this. One would not put it down as the nineteenth item on a regular agenda, but call a special meeting for the decision to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding York, the Bill was not drafted in this way for fear that the schools in York would change their minds. It was a question of clearing the air so that purposeful discussions could take place in York. If it is correct that there will be objections from voluntary schools, the sooner the local authorities know that some schools will not elect, and can object to the scheme so that new plans can be made, the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there had been an overwhelming desire from the local authorities concerned for us to delay, that would have been fair enough, but there has not been an overwhelming desire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat what I said earlier: if this scheme meets with the approval of the people in the area, they have no problems about carrying on. The problem arises only if they do not wish to carry on. That is why we made the date 1 October.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Christopher Price: I do not want to delay the Committee. This is a very narrow amendment applying to only one local education authority. But while I can understand the reasons and motives for inserting this date, it seems to show a lack of understanding about how some managers and governors work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with local education authorities. They are politically controlled and one could get some certainty, of the kind that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0485">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>143</span>
the managers of this Committee love, about timetables, decisions and that sort of thing. But governors of voluntary schools are not that sort of body. They are not politically controlled. They are composed of individuals who like to weigh up the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not until the end of this month will the managers and governors of these voluntary schools be able to read the full text of the Bill, if it becomes an Act, even if all the Lords procedures have been completed by the earliest time for which the Government hope. Most of the managers and governors will be on holiday during August. I am not concerned so much about the chairmen or the clerks to the governors, but to tell individual managers and governors of these schools in York who want the chance to persuade their colleagues that election might be a good thing that they have only three weeks in which the read the Bill before a special meeting is called and a decision taken whether to elect—which is effectively what the hon. Gentleman is saying—seems to me to be a negation of democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the hon. Gentleman of the comments of Mr. Justice Donaldson in the Enfield case, which brought down the reputation of one of the legal advisers to the Department of Education. It was when Lord Gordon Walker, then Secretary of State, gave Enfield seven days to make representations to him before he took a decision. The language used by Mr. Justice Donaldson about that case was some of the most scathing ever used in the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is here giving, in effect, individual managers and governors three weeks. I am not talking about the clerks or the chairmen, who may have had discussions about this before, but about managers and governors generally. These are meant to be democratic bodies which discuss matters. To say that they will have only three weeks is holding out a terrible hostage to fortune and may send the previous legal adviser's successor—I shall not mention the gentleman's name—the same way as his predecessor. I should hate that to happen. Will the hon. Gentleman at least give an undertaking that he will think about the matter before Report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the provision will put at risk officials of the Department, I am sure that they will bring that information to me quickly. I remember the Enfield case and I have a friend who was involved in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>144</span>
We have considered the question of the date. If there had been an overwhelming desire by local authorities to change it, we would have done so. The main thing is to get the matter sorted out. If they like a scheme, all they need to do is to say "yes", and I do not think that it would require special meetings. They could either opt into a scheme as it existed, or they would opt out in order to consider minor changes. Unless something changes our mind before Report, I think that we should stand by the date of 1 October.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to "something changing our mind."

	<span class='label label-info column'>145</span>
local education authorities that want to revoke in September and go back to the 11-plus to do so, particularly in constituencies inhabited by Chief Whips and Home Secretaries, and other such places. Although we do not agree with it and think it a crazy thing to do, and feel that the people will have their revenge later on at the ballot box, we can see that this is the sort of political objective which a Government will sometimes achieve as soon as they come to power. But there is plenty of time for the Government to rethink the schemes which go beyond 1979. There is no real reason why they should be allowed this revocation procedure which involves no consultation with governors and managers.

It is becoming clear why the Government are saying "No consultation with governors or managers". This is a "chop" procedure whereby teachers who thought they would be teaching in comprehensive schools will switch back to grammar schools—we saw that situation in all the nonsense we had in Tameside a few years ago. If the Government want to create such nonsense, I suppose they have the power of Votes in Parliament to do so. But we do not understand why there should be this absolute refusal to allow consultation about schemes to be affected in I2 months and 24 months, and even beyond 1984–85, and why they should be subject to this chop-off procedure without any consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Under-Secretary of State has given a pledge of sorts that he will think about things, and as it does seem that he wishes to make progress, he could perhaps give some kind of pledge on this matter. If he were to do so I would not want to protract this discussion. We hope that he will give an undertaking to facilitate consultation before the revocation procedures become effective in relation to 1980–81 schemes. If he does, I will be quite happy to let this provision go through and to facilitate matters, but if we come across this absolute brick wall again and he says that the Government are not interested in looking further at the matter before Report, we may have much more to say about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>146</span>
as it is. If local education authorities want to continue with their comprehensive plans, there will be no problems whatever. We are not compelling any of them to revoke. There is no gun at their backs. If they wish to continue with plans made under the Labour Government, they may do so. But if there is revocation—which means that those plans will not be carried out—and there has to be consultation on alternative plans, the sooner that revocation happens the better, so that parents, teachers, pupils and governors know the situation. If the amendment were accepted, it would apply only to clause 1(3) and to schemes to be implemented in September 1979. It would continue through considerable areas of the country, and teachers and others would be left wondering whether or not schemes were to be carried through. Therefore, we intend to resist amendment No. 11.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is regrettable that the Under-Secretary has apparently misinterpreted the remarks and the import of amendment No. 11. It appeared to us that if the hon. Gentleman is seeking to give certainty, it is better guaranteed by amendment No. 11 than it is by the peculiar proposal that the hon. Gentleman makes to allow the revocation closure dates to be the dates on which it was originally intended, under the 1976 Act, that reorganisation would take place. In that sense we are doing our best to assist the hon. Gentleman in crystallising his Bill. But these are matters which deserve fuller consideration, not to say consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend said, had the Government accepted the proposals which we put with, I though, considerable force, on the obligation to consult, many of these problems could have been removed. Given the tight drafting and the legalistic purpose of the Bill—clearly, it has nothing to do with education—the only reassurance that we could cheerfully seek from the Government is that no steps towards revocation, or other changes which will arise as a consequence of the temptations or facilities offered by this Bill, shall be taken without the consultation that we consider to be desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issues raised by the amendments require exhaustive attention. They cannot be fittingly considered in the hurried atmosphere of the Committee, so we shall seek to withdraw the amendments, with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0487">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>147</span>
the hope that we can have not only the consideration of the Secretary of State for our constructive purpose in moving them, and possibly a consideration of the force of those arguments and the purpose behind them, but also further debate at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the circumstances, and hoping that the words of the Minister meant that he would really think about the problems that we have outlined.

	<div class='title'>CITATION, CONSTRUCTION AND EXTENT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 9 in page 2, line 12, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) Nothing in this Act shall affect schemes in which admission of pupils is not based (wholly or partly) on selection by reference to ability or aptitude and which are already implemented under section 13 of the Education Act 1974".</p></blockquote>
It is a further attempt by us to secure undertakings concerning the established non-selective sector. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will understand that the Bill was introduced with haste—as I said earlier, not in the last minute but in the first minute. We have become accustomed to undue haste being manifested by scramble in the dying seconds of a Parliament, or indeed of any other institution or event. Here we have a precipitate proposal that has not had sufficient consultation and does not match the aspirations of a large number of people in this country, but nevertheless in order to satisfy certain perverse ends of the Government it has been introduced as the first Bill of this Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, even in our innocent, generous
	<span class='label label-info column'>148</span>
minds, those circumstances sparked the feeling that the Bill had far greater implications than the Government had presented. We therefore tabled the amendment to try to ensure that nothing arising from the Bill, despite the apparent confines of subsection (2), could bring about subsequent revocation, settlement or change of any significance in the existing comprehensive sector—among those 83 per cent. of children who attend non-selective schools in 70 per cent. of the local authorities in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may wish to investigate the matter further, but I shall be glad to have the Minister's comments now on our request for reassurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the comments of the hon. Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock). There is a tendency in all parties to look at the other party's legislation with a magnifying glass for its possible effects or ramifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is no intention in the Bill of destroying existing comprehensive schools. Where areas have gone comprehensive and are happy to have done so, they will continue with their comprehensive schools. The intention—as I tried to say earlier this morning—is to go back to the pre-1976 position, whereby local education authorities organised schools in their area in the way that they wished and that had the support of the people in the area, and where any proposed changes came before the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned that 83 per cent. of children in this country were in comprehensive schemes. It seems likely that the overwhelming number of children will remain in authorities with comprehensive schools. Clearly, the people of those areas are satisfied with those schools and will not want to change. Nor is any proposal for change written into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, I must place it on record that, just as one Parliament cannot condemn or fasten down its successor, so a return to the pre-1976 situation, which, as the hon. Gentleman knows, permitted the vast move towards comprehensive schools under the 1944 Act, will mean that areas that have selective schools and wish to keep them selective can do so; areas that have comprehensive schools and wish to remain comprehensive—as I imagine most of them will wish to do—can also do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0488">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>149</span>
Only in areas that wish to move from selective to non-selective education, or in the occasional area that wishes to move from non-selective to selective education, will changes occur. Where such a change is desired, the authority will have to go through the normal channel of a section 13 notice. There is nothing in the Bill to prompt any authority that has gone comprehensive to change to a slective system. Undoubtedly, in an area where a comprehensive school satisfies the people of that area, the Bill will have no effect at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That, to some extent, is a reassurance. However, we cannot neglect—I do not think the hon. Gentleman would expect us to neglect—the prevailing political atmosphere. While I do not for a moment disbelieve what the Minister says or the sincerity with which he says it, there remain areas to explore. This is especially so in View of the possibility that he mentioned—not so much as a consequence of the words of the Bill but of the attitudes and environment which the Bill manifests—that we shall want to take the opportunity of an Education Bill to explore these matters further.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flannery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is obvious that we now want to have a very serious Report stage of the Bill. Nonetheless, it is necessary to say some words in the Committee about certain aspects of it. In new clause 1 refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the continual review of pupils' standards of educational achievement to ensure that they can transfer easily from secondary modern schools to grammar schools."</p></blockquote>
On Second Reading, the usual nonsense was trotted out by various Conservative hon. Members about the tripartite system making it easy to transfer from secondary modern schools to grammar schools. Nothing is further from the truth. In most areas, even large areas, the number of children who have transferred from the secondary schools, where the vast majority of our children were consigned, to the grammar schools was almost nil, and everybody knows that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It makes one suspicious of the motives of hon. Members opposite when they insist, in the face of all the evidence, that somehow there was constant traffic between the two schools and that young people who showed themselves as late developers had the facilities to move from the secondary modern schools to the grammar schools. Hon. Gentlemen know that to be true. If they have figures to show that we are not talking reality, we are more than eager to have those figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One hesitates to talk about late developers when one talks about the 11-plus. The 11-plus is so narrow in its scope and it so dominated the curricula of the primary schools that in many schools cramming was the order of the day and young children had narrow approaches to arithmetic and English in particular, often to the exclusion of a great deal of what they should have been studying in other subjects. Most of us know that the lifting of the 11-plus was the lifting of a terrible cloud from the primary schools. Imme-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0489">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>151</span>
diately there was a flowering of knowledge in every other direction away from the narrowness defined in the 11-plus. Therefore, what are we Seeking in the new clause and the additional clauses?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Past experience has been absolutely abysmal and I hope that we will all admit that. I hope that we will talk truth to one another about this because it was dreadful for young people in the secondary modern schools. Their chances of moving away from them were almost non-existent. For us to theorise and pretend that they could is untrue. Of course this dreadful Bill will go through. Otherwise we would not have been sitting quiet and withdrawing amendments this morning. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock) said, the Bill has no connection with education but is a cold, legalistic document which will take the educational system as far back as the Bill can manage in the present context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we want to ensure that those children who have, for instance, ability in languages can emerge. The idea that we can judge a child's achievement between 9 o'clock and 11 o'clock on 3 March, when possibly he had been sleepless throughout the night or there had been some upset in the family at the time, or that we dare to say to any child that he or she has failed at such a tender age, would be a dreadful anti- educational thing to do, and I hope that hon. Gentlemen opposite will agree with me. The Under-Secretary of State nods in agreement with what I say—he and his colleagues are going to do that. We want some safeguards built in so that we can help the children even after that crime has been perpetrated against them. We want to try to build in something which will give our children the right to move.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon Gentlemen know—some of them have been teachers—that there is often a flowering of knowledge in some of our children even after we have decided, at an all too early age, that there was not. One of the dreadful aspects of the 11-plus was that teachers were separating children at the age of five or six and calling one group grammar school material. Certainly they were doing that with children aged eight, and often earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One heard teachers in the past—fortunately, in our city, many years past—talking about tiny children as though their lives were decided and they, were going either to grammar school or secondary modern. From that time they were often
	<span class='label label-info column'>152</span>
streamed and did not have access to the knowledge which would get them to grammar school because it had already been decided that they did not have grammar school potential. We all know that that is dreadful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None the less, even after being subjected to that, knowledge flowered in those children. For example, they showed a gift for languages. Some children were the type that began to show a real interest in books and to read more than hitherto. It became obvious, even under those circumstances, that they ought to have access to a higher form of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seek reassurance from the Minister, and I hope that the Government will accept what we seek to do. Everybody who is sincere about education wants to build into the Bill legislation which will enable children to pass from one school to another in a way that has never previously been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In new clause 4 the Opposition are deeply concerned that liaison should be built into the curriculum of the secondary modern schools and the local grammar school, so that the children in the secondary modern schools are studying subjects which will enable them if they show some ability, to pass with ease into the grammar school. They must not suffer when they get there, having left their companions and the atmosphere of the school in which they have worked hard and shown their ability. Without developing my argument to any depth, those are the reasons for the new clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eastham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is one of the prime issues, to which the Committee should give serious consideration. This has always been one of the major issues over the years with the old system. In my own authority, as I have said at previous meetings, we do not suffer all the pressures that some towns and cities unfortunately still experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This issue is one of the old failings that we were never able to resolve. Naturally there was a considerable feeling among parents of distrust towards the local authority and the education committee because, although assurances were given—I have heard them given many times—that if the child turned out to be bright he would be accommodated, it was a complete farce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone knows that that is not possible. Often the numbers of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0490">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>153</span>
schools are matched according to intake, and consequently the situation never arises where a child who is not making progress is withdrawn from a grammar school to give the opportunity to the bright child. The position becomes impossible. Consequently, the young child acquires a feeling of failure and inevitably there is a grave loss of talent. A further consequence of this feeling of failure is the frustration of the pupil who then becomes rebellious and does not do well when expected to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is over I0 years since we suffered all the nonsense of selection in my own authority. When we asked questions on how many could transfer we found that there were only about 70 or 80 a year out of an intake of several thousand children. It became an impossible task. All kinds of appeals and protestations were made by parents about what they could do for their children. It was even conceded on many occasions by head teachers and classroom teachers that something should be done for a child of talent who had developed and showed great potential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should come clean on this and tell us what we should do with the so-called "11-plus failures" who later on became brilliant. I have often met distinguished people who say, with a measure of pride, "I was an 11-plus failure," and who later became brilliant and recognised. Will the Minister, without making heavy weather of it concede the point? Otherwise, we shall have instances of talented children who fails the 11-plus and then has to receive private education. Those parents who cannot afford it have to squeeze the purse in order to draw the child out of normal county education and provide the facilities for which the local education authority failed him. We should take issue on this provision. The Minister really ought to view it with sympathy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt of the good intentions of the new clauses. Nor am I suspicious of the motives of hon. Gentlemen in tabling them. I always enjoy the interventions of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mr. Flannery) and I enjoyed the speech of the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Mr. Eastham). As an 11-plus failure myself, I glowed at his reference to those who had later attained prominence in public life. It may have been an intentional, courteous remark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>154</span>
One of the problems in grammar and secondary modern schools has been the different syllabuses. I am well aware of that, and of the difficulty of transfer. One of the weaknesses of the selective system has always been the difficulty of transfer, along with the difficulty involved in maintaining friendship patterns once they are established, as well as the difference between the curricula—the subjects taught in the secondary modern schools and in the grammar schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention behind the new clauses, that there should be discussions between the heads and staff of the secondary modern and the grammar schools, is a good one. I would hope that in all good practice discussion goes on now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it would be dangerous to lay down what the set proportion for grammar schools should be nationally, in view of the various types of intake all over the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Members for Hillsborough and Blackley take what I am about to say as helpful. There is a big problem here, not just between the secondary modern and the grammar school curricula but between various comprehensive schools. I have always been a supporter of a core curriculum, that a basic number of subjects should be taught in every type of school, both at primary and secondary levels. The difference presents an acute problem between the secondary modern and the grammar school, but I think that there is a movement towards a core curriculum in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock) mentioned a change of climate in many areas of education, a change which is largely non-political—certainly it is non-party political—which shows a desire to have some form of core curriculum, so that when parents move from an area the children can continue in a new school without their studies being set back a year because of the different syllabus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could not accept the new clauses for the simple reason that we have never laid down these conditions nationally. It would be an entirely new avenue of approach, but I accept totally the spirit in which the new clauses were tabled and, certainly, as far as we are concerned—and, it appears, so far as the Opposition are concerned—if we can move to a core curriculum between secondary modern
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0491">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>155</span>
schools and grammar schools, with easy transfer where the selective system exists, as well as a core curriculum throughout the country, it would be good for all schools in the land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to say a word on new clause 8, which was my handiwork. The problem in many schools that decide to revoke under the Bill is that to go back to the 11-plus examination in the big cities would no longer produce the certainty that it produced in the old days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the years after 1944, where local education authorities had grammar, secondary modern and sometimes technical schools, they planned, and succeeded in achieving, reasonable percentages—15 per cent. or 20 per cent. for the grammar schools, five or 10 per cent. for technical schools, and the rest were sent to secondary modern schools. But, as the Under-Secretary knows, the populations of the inner cities are falling at a considerable rate. It is difficult to close a grammar school and easier to close a secondary modern school, which may be in less satisfactory buildings or may be a less popular school because it does not include the full range of ability. Therefore, if there is no planning by the local authority the proportion going to grammar schools goes up to perhaps 50 per cent. The demographic trend has made many of our big cities go comprehensive. If areas of inner London such as Hackney and Islington did not go comprehensive but allowed the grammar schools to survive and closed or ran down the secondary and comprehensive as the population fell, there would be appalling apartheid in those areas, with half the pupils going to so-called grammar schools, where the curriculum would be unsuitable for many of them, and the other half going to secondary modern schools. In the borough of Lewisham, which I represent, some secondary modern schools are less than half full. Their population is dropping because they are unpopular, whereas the popular schools—including grammar schools when they existed—are full to bursting point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If local education authorities are to have the right of revocation, they should tell the parents in their areas how they propose to keep the balance between grammar and secondary modern schools. If they are not reminded of their responsibility under the Bill, children will be sent
	<span class='label label-info column'>156</span>
to unsuitable schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a modest new clause. I had hoped that as time was marching on the Under-Secretary would accept new clauses left, right and centre in his earnestness to make progress. However, I should certainly like some comment from him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take note of the points raised by the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price). One of the weaknesses of the selective system is that a disparate number goes to selective schools in one area as opposed to another. We know the famous illustration is Hull, where the proportion was 5 per cent., which contrasted so greatly with some areas of Wales where it was 50 per cent. The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the falling populations of inner cities and the acute problem of what should happen regarding the education of the children there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I sympathise with the intention of the new clause, no Government can be tied down by legislation at this point. It is a similar situation with the co-curriculum. A climate of opinion is being built up. In any case, in one area, because of the various population groups, there could be a high selection rate, whereas another area, because of socio-economic problems, would probably not have the same height of selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I can take the spirit of the new clauses by saying that in an area parents should know the selection that exists and what percentage it should be. I should be relatively consistent. If one closes one type of school and not the other, they will not be grammar schools, whatever label one gives them. That has been one of the problems in London by changes in the composition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should not like to accept the new clauses and then find that we had thereby laid down stringent provision for the whole of the education system in a way that has never been done before. We have never laid down a national curriculum. I am sure that neither the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mr. Flannery) nor the NUT would like it to be laid down nationally. We have never laid down the means of procedure nationally. We have never laid down the percentage nationally. It would be wrong to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not surprised to hear the hon. Gentleman saying that he did not want a universal application of a co-curriculum. I have always thought of him
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0492">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>157</span>
as much more a Wellington-like figure than a Napoleaonic figure. He said that parents should know the percentage in their area. If the percentage is so small as effectively to forbid the parents of children who cannot afford to pay for those children to go to crammers to take advantage—if advantage is the word—of the 11-plus in order to gain access to a grammar school, all the knowing and all the statistical expertise will not make much difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eastham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am getting a little confused about this matter of percentage. Are we saying that every year the percentage will be the same of those who ought to pass the 11-plus? Are we gearing ourselves to fit in with the schools, or are we attempting to gear ourselves to fit in with the talents of the children year by year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has defined the problem specifically. It is a fact that the percentages vary from year to year barely to one-tenth of a decimal point in those areas that are still afficted by the 11-plus system. I have figures from throughout the whole country to show conclusively that that is the case. I hope that on some further occasion when we discuss these matters we shall be able to assist the Minister by drawing attention to the extraordinary accuracy, even in a changing educational world, of the percentages year after year. I should be interested to know what value he thinks knowledge of the percentage is to parents who cannot avail themselves of the entry charge—for that is what it is—of securing specialist cramming education for their children in the latter years of primary school where a selective system exists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that that was the intention of new clause 8. It says:

I thought that presumably the Secretary of State would then make it available. He

would not hide it in a closet or in a locker in this building but would make it available for the parents to see. I thought that the hon.

I am sure that I speak for all its members when I say that we appreciate your chairmanship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse that tribute, Miss Fookes. I understand that there is some contention in the House at the moment over the question of allocation of Chairs, not in the Standing Committee system but in the Select Committee system. If we ever achieve the kind of parliamentary reform that permits the election or appointment of chairmen of Standing Committees, you may be assured that you will top our poll on every occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary of State suggested that he was out of order in raising the point at this time. I have to inform him that this Chairman never rules compliments out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Bill to be reported, without amendment, Committee rose at five minutes to One o'clock.</i></p>
