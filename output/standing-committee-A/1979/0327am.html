	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 184, in page 15, leave out lines 6 to 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chairman: With this amendment it will be convenient for us to take new clause 15—	<i>Amendment</i> 	<i>of</i> s.12 	<i>of</i> 	<i>the</i> 1975 	<i>Act</i> (No. 2)</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must tell you at the outset, Mr. Goodhew, that I drafted these amendments on certain assumptions that seem to have been knocked somewhat askew by the statement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in opening his Budget yesterday. I felt that whilst obviously there were many matters which deeply divided, the two sides of the Committee, none the less there was some common ground. I say that I had assumed that. I felt—to take a step-by-step approach, which is fashionable these days—first, that we all believed that the best way to conduct our industrial relations system was by collective bargaining and that that was a belief and approach to industrial relations that was shared not only by members of the Committee but by members of the Royal Commission on trade unions and, indeed, by the Chancellor himself. I remember that when the Industrial Relations Bill was presented to the House in 1970, those who were then responsible for that legislation declared their belief in the idea that our industrial relations system should be based on collective bargaining conducted through strong trade unions. So I assumed that we shared a view that collective bargaining was the best way of conducting our industrial relations system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It follows that, if we believe in collective bargaining, we believe in bargaining through collective organisations—workers' organisations—and that we then believe that those organisations should conduct their collective bargaining with employers
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1590</span>
or employers' associations on the basis of a mutual recognition of one party by the other. We know that in many cases all our assumptions are not shared by employers; that many employers resist trade union organisation of their work force or at least refuse to enter into negotiations and discussions with the relevant trade unions. I thought that we shared that assumption and that therefore we all accepted that trade unions ought to have the right to seek to be recognised for purposes of collective bargaining by employers, and that all that divided us on this was what were the right means of doing it or the extent to which trade unions should have recourse to machinery of one kind or another when faced with a recalcitrant, stubborn and pig-headed employer who refused to recognise them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unhappily, however, these assumptions were somewhat knocked askew by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his Budget statement yesterday. I do not want to trespass on amendments that we shall be debating later in the day, Mr. Goodhew. Doubtless there are other parts of the right hon. Gentleman's statement yesterday which my hon. Friends will wish to allude to, particularly the impact of the Budget on low-paid workers. But, according to 	<i>The Guardian,</i> the Chancellor did say in the course of his speech:—
	<br><q><p>"Successive Governments acknowledged the need to seduce the power and privilege of organised labour, but in the event its ability to damage the economy has increased. The outcome is familiar to us all: our underlying rate of growth has become steadily weaker, at the same time we have come almost to tolerate inflation at rates which would have horrified an earlier generation."</p></q>
So we have it in a nutshell. We understand more about the Government's fundamental and underlying approach to industrial relations and trade unions from that short statement yesterday uttered from the Dispatch Box in the House of Commons than anything that we have heard from the Government Benches in this Committee or on the Floor of the House from the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My assumption was that we all shared the view that trade unions were essential for collective bargaining and that collective bargaining should be the basis of our industrial relations system, and that it followed from that that trade unions should have the right to seek to be recognised for collective bargaining purposes. But, instead, we learn now that the Government are blaming the trade unions
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1357">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1591</span>
for every economic ill that besets the country. That is what the Chancellor's statement says. So it follows from that that they do not believe that trade unions should have strength and should be recognised, unless perhaps they have in mind what have become increasingly known in recent years as "sweetheart" unions, compliant staff associations, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The approach I adopted when I drafted these amendments—that all that we were talking about was the most sensible way in which trade unions could seek recognition—has proved to be somewhat fallacious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me return to the assumptions that I made in the first place and the arguments that I was about to advance on that basis. I have no right to speak for ACAS, the TUC or anyone else. There are those who would say that the Labour Government in 1975, with the best intentions in the world, sought to lay down for the first time a statutory procedure by means of which a trade union could seek recognition where an employer was reluctant to grant it. But experience has shown that that procedure has not stood the test. It has been subjected to tests and in some instances it has proved wanting. I am the first to recognise and accept that. Indeed, it would have been remarkable if everything that we had put into that great Act, the Employment Protection Act, had been perfect. It would have been remarkable, seeing that we were entering so much new territory and breaking new ground, if we had got it right from the outset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recognition provisions in sections 11 to 16 of the Employment Protection Act have worked in many cases, but I think it is equally true that many more cases where trade unions have sought recognition have been solved peacefully, and the trade unions have won their recognition peacefully without publicity through the conciliation procedures, the conciliation machinery and the skilled conciliators of ACAS. I think that the Government have been tempted to say, because it has worked more effectively in that area and in that respect, that we should rest on that alone and seek to avoid the legal difficulties, amongst others, that have arisen from the application of sections 11 to 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that that is wrong. The procedure is not working properly. But to abandon the whole idea and to say that we should not have any statutory procedure is wrong. If we do not have it right, I think that we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1592</span>
should keep chipping away and modifying it until we get it right. I think of the cases where conciliation, good sense and the hard work of skilled negotiators have failed and, having failed, there has been no alternative to resorting to industrial action for workers who were seeking to be recognised collectively by their employers. I am the first to regret that necessity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been some cases in recent years where, clearly, conciliation would have failed. I think not only of the infamous Grunwick case. Incidentally, Mr. Good-hew, the new clause seeks to exclude the courts and judicial intervention from this process of recognition. I do not want to go over again all the well-trodden ground of the Grunwick dispute, nor do I want to provoke the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst). But I think it is worth recalling that it was Mr. Ward who at one stage in all those processes ignored the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: His guru.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's friend, my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) says. Mr. Ward at one stage defied the recommendations of the courts and this eventually led to those unhappy scenes on the streets of Willesden. There have been other cases. I can recall the case of Roberts Arundel at Stockport. My hon. Friends may recall that infamous situation. There was violence because an employer refused pigheadedly and stubbornly to recognise trade unions and the right of the workers in his establishment to organise themselves for the purpose of collective bargaining. There was another case more recently in the Salford area—Autoradio, Motoradio, or something like that. There have been a number of these cases in which attempts to conciliate to bring about a peaceful understanding between the employer and the workers and their representatives have failed, and because there was not an adequate and effective procedure, whether statutory or otherwise, and there was no machinery left to help resolve that dispute, there was no other course for the employees but to take industrial action industrial action which degenerated into some very ugly scenes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the new clause which seeks to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1358">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1593</span>
exclude the courts or any other judicial bodies from involvement in this process. We have from time to time talked about the conflict that arises between the courts and those engaged in industrial relations. The courts are bound—it is in their very nature—to have regard to the letter of the law, whereas those engaged in managing industrial relations—full-time trade union officials, shop stewards, and managements at all levels—are concerned not so much with the law as with keeping good relations, keeping production going and avoiding disputes. Often the letter of the law and the conduct of industrial relations are incompatible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not to say that we should not have provisions laid down in an Act of Parliament. But to those who say that an Act of Parliament ought to be enforceable or treatable by some judicial body, I reply that that is generally but not always true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I have suggested in the new clause is by no means unprecedented. It is not unique. The Trade Union Act 1913 excludes from certain of its provisions the intervention of the courts. Indeed, the words that I originally drafted were culled direct from that statute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Labour Government repealed that in 1975.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We repealed it because we made it unnecessary. I am merely making the point to those who would argue that it is a contradiction to have a statutory provision that is irremediable or unenforceable by the courts or any other judicial body, that it has been carried out in other Acts of Parliament—not merely in the Trade Union Act 1913. I am sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman, whose knowledge of the statutes is doubtless far more extensive than mine, could quote other examples. If not, his splendid officials at the Department of Employment could do it for him. Indeed, I hope that they are drafting a note for him now to give him one or two examples, just in case he contradicts what I am saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Winston Churchill remarked many years ago that, because of their background, education and the environment in which they lived, judges were not the best people to make judgments about matters affecting the relationships between people in industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been deploying a general theme,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1594</span>
but we have had specific experiences of the intervention of the courts in recognition disputes since the 1975 Act. I am reluctant to raise matters for which you might reproach me, Mr. Goodhew—that is, criticism of the judiciary. But it is inescapable that I should point out some of the ways in which the judges have thwarted our best intentions of 1975. When we were framing those parts of the Employment Protection Act, we could never have envisaged what some judges would say and how some judges would, in my view perversely, interpret the provisions of that statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give an example. The hon and learned Gentleman will recall that when the Employment Protection Bill was in Committee, we debated certain parts of the 1975 Act and I think that there was an amendment about part of section 14. This dealt with an obligation on the Service in the course of attempting to resolve a recognition reference to it, to consult the workers. We provided that if a trade union had made a reference to the Service complaining that an employer refused recognition and the trade union thought that recognition should be accorded, first, if the Service thought that it was a valid reference, it would by conciliation seek to resolve the difficulties and make inquiries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We provided in section 14 of the 1975 Act:
	<br><q><p>"in the course of its inquiries into a recognition issue under section 12 or 13 above the Service shall ascertain the opinions of workers to whom the issue relates by any means it thinks fit".</p></q>
I argued in the Committee then, and, as I said, I think that there was an amendment, the case for changing the deliberate vagueness of the obligation on the Service to ascertain the opinions of workers. The then Opposition asked "What does 'ascertain the opinions of workers' mean? Surely it should mean 'the workers' or `all the workers', otherwise it gives the Service the discretion to consult a proportion as it thinks fit." We replied "Yes, that is our intention." We acted on the premise that the Service was staffed by sensible people who would have a great deal of experience in industrial relations, and that such people would make judgments about the right proportion, and about how practical or impractical it might be to consult all the workers. To make the wording other than that which we had
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1359">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1595</span>
chosen, to make it "the opinions of the workers" by the insertion of the definite article, would be interpreted—indeed, it could have no other meaning than this—as an obligation to consult all the workers. We might as well have put in the phrase "all the workers".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pointed out that if we adopted that course, the absence of just one worker in any situation anticipated by the section would automatically invalidate in the court any recommendation made by the Service. The person could be working abroad, or off sick, and so on. The Committee divided, and the vote confirmed the words that the then Government had drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there arose an actual case, the Grunwick case, where, for reasons that I shall not go into now, the Service had not consulted all the workers. The case was referred to the court and eventually finished up before Lord Denning, who said, in effect "Ah, how odd of Parliament to put in such a phrase as 'the opinions of workers'. Surely it must mean 'the opinions of the workers', which in turn means all workers. "Lord Denning stated that the Service had not consulted all the workers, therefore the recommendation of the Service became invalid, and his Lordship decided against the Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here was a judge not merely perversely interpreting the statute but actually making law that Parliament had specifically rejected. We had turned down the word which he put in. I maintain that that is a monstrous state of affairs. We must respect the courts, of course, but in turn the courts have a duty to recognise what we put into a statute. When we uphold the courts, we do so in respect of their judicial function, not in the sense that they can override Parliament, or become a one-man parliament to make the law as they wish. That is just one illustration where the judges and the courts have misinterpreted or sought to create a law that Parliament never intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, amongst others, I think that it would be right, if we can devise a satisfactory statutory procedure on the basis of seeking to understand how our industrial relations system works and to strengthen and reinforce that industrial relations system in the interests of good and improved industrial relations to help industry and commerce to get on with its job—and I hope that that is what the Committee is all about—to do that without the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1596</span>
risk of it being interfered with and upset by judicial figures who perhaps have scant knowledge of and little regard for those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some may say that, desirable as that is, it is no part of the function of our judges to be concerned primarily with ensuring that improved industrial relations prevail. It is their task to interpret, as they feel right, the statutes passed by Parliament—to interpret those statutes not in the light of experience in industrial relations, because they do not have that, but in the light of their accumulated experience of the law and the letter of the law, conditioned by their own class origins, background and social 	<i>milieu.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And membership of a closed shop. If I may be forgiven a slight digression, Mr. Goodhew, I cannot help smiling wryly sometimes when I hear lawyers in the House of Commons castigating trade unions for retaining outdated and restrictive practices and perpetuating inefficiency, not the least because we all know that the courts and the judicial system are riddled with inefficiencies and the retention of outdated and restrictive practices. Each morning, when coming to the Committee, I come from my accommodation in the Fleet Street area and take the tube from Temple station. The shortest and most pleasant way to the station is to walk through the very pleasant gardens of the Inner and Middle Temple. The hon. and learned Gentleman will be very familiar with that. It is a pleasant way to start the day, contemplating what I am about to inflict upon the Committee. Yet I cannot help smiling when I see a figure who seems to belong to the Dickensian past, flittering around in the late hours of the evening or small hours of the morning, carrying a long pole with a light at the end of it, lighting or putting out the gas lamps in the Inner Temple. That is true. That was by way of a digression, but I hope my hon. Friends will bear it in mind the next time they hear a barrister Member of this House berating the trade unions for perpetuating outdated and inefficient restrictive practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the essential theme underlying the amendment. It is not my intention, by the strict wording of the amendment, that we should continue to have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1360">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1597</span>
exactly the statutory procedures laid down in sections 11 to 16 of the Employment Protection Act. I am the first to recognise that experience has proved them to be defective, that we need to look at them again, and that we perhaps need to have a different kind of approach to that embodied in them, or modify that approach to make them work. That is the first thing I urge upon the Committee. Because the procedures have not worked just as we wanted is not an argument for chucking the whole process out and leaving us with no procedures at all, not necessarily laid down in the Act itself but perhaps in a code of practice. I urge the Government to think again about how to resolve that kind of difficult recognition issue which in recent years has led to ugly scenes—unacceptable scenes sometimes—that none of us wants. Yet if workers have no alternative method of seeking recognition from their employer, unacceptable though it may be—understandable though it may be—we want some kind of procedure that will provide decent civilised machinery to avoid the battles on the stones whether in Willesden or anywhere else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, as I hope I have illustrated to the Committee, all too often those provisions of the 1975 Act have failed in their purpose because of the intervention of the judiciary and, because members of the judiciary are not the best people to make important decisions that influence and affect industrial relations, it ought to be left to those who do understand industrial relations. The judiciary ought to be excluded from whatever processes we lay down. That is the essence of my argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Giles Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has made an extremely good case, and I want to back him up on one or two points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Might I remind Government supporters of the close connection between trade union organisation and collective bargaining. Of course, one cannot have collective bargaining without some initial trade union membership. On the other hand, without collective bargaining, without an established negotiating procedure, it is extremely difficult in some industries and companies for unions to expand and retain their membership. Quite naturally, members want results and, if they see that the union is not recognised by the employer and there is not a negotiating procedure, they will begin to wonder whether it is worth the trouble, particularly in some kinds of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1598</span>
industries where it is difficult to organise, for example, because there is high labour turnover, because there are small establishments—it is interesting that the ACAS report shows that the majority of recognition cases are associated with small firms—or because there are groups of employees who are not used to collective organisation and who are apathetic to trade unionism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this kind of situation, the employer's attitude is absolutely crucial, as all the studies on trade union membership and its growth over the last two decades have shown. If an employer refuses to give negotiating rights, he can in many cases defeat the trade union's efforts to establish membership in these kinds of industries and firms. At best, one has the long-drawn-out, bitter disputes such as the one at Grunwick which are so bad for, and such a disgrace to, this country. I will not go into Grunwick, because I do not wish to reopen old sores, but I hope that the majority of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee want to avoid that kind of dispute
The case for a recognition procedure is that it enables trade unions to establish a right to recognition, as my right hon. Friend said, without involving that kind of dispute. The Donovan report was very emphatic that what was needed was some kind of statutory recognition procedure. In the Donovan commission's proposals, a trade union which, though it had a fair amount of support in a plant or company, found management continuing to resist its demands for recognition, was able to get the case referred to the Commission on Industrial Relations, and if the commission was satisfied that the union had achieved a reasonable membership, it would be in a position to issue a report. In those circumstances, if the employer continued to refuse to recognise and negotiate with trade unions where the Commission on Industrial Relations had found in its favour, the commission would be empowered to recommend that the union should have the right to unilateral arbitration. This was the sanction that the Donovan commission proposed. Even in the Industrial Relations Act there were recognition procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a debating point, the hon. and learned Gentleman said that we had repealed those procedures. That is true. The reason is that they were too associated with the Industrial Relations Court which, as the hon. and learned Gentleman has often said to the Committee, was an unsatisfactory body.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1361">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1599</span>
It was too stuck on a rather inflexible balloting figure to establish whether the trade union had support—a figure, incidentally, which the Donovan commission itself had criticised. When the Labour Government repealed the Industrial Relations Act, they were not saying that there should not be some statutory recognition procedures. They were saying that the procedures in the Industrial Relations Act were not perfect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I apologise. I took the hon. and learned Gentleman in vain, and I do not like to mistreat him not much, at any rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there still is the point that, whereas in the Industrial Relations Act the Government recognised that statutory recognition procedures could avoid disputes, they are now abandoning the ideal totally. They have to explain this tremendous difference in approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we came to power and introduced the Employment Protection Bill, we gave ACAS a central role in recognition procedures. These have been explained by my right hon. Friend. In fact, ACAS has had a good record on recognition cases. It solved 734 of 1,316 cases on a voluntary basis, according to the 1978 report. It was able to do that because it had legislative backing—a backing of statutory means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept, as my right hon. Friend did, that it did not work perfectly. But the legislation may not have been strong enough. The courts made some difference to that. My right hon. Friend has already quoted the Grunwick 	<i>v.</i> ACAS judgment which, in a sense, has given the green light to employers who want to resist the Employment Protection Act provisions by saying that they have no legal obligation to co-operate with ACAS. Unpleasant, anti-union employers such as those at Grunwick have been encouraged to resist ACAS here. ACAS points that out in its report. It refers particularly to the behavi-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1600</span>
our of the Michelin tyre company, which procrastinated and delayed for a long time until given the green light by the judgment on Grunwick 	<i>v.</i> ACAS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, therefore, the legislation was not perfect, and ACAS has been concerned about its role in recognition. It was concerned that the hostility of some employers to that was cutting across its other activities. We do not see that as an argument for going on to say that there should be no statutory recognition procedures at all. Just because the present procedures are not working perfectly, that does not mean that we should abandon statutory recognition altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have used the problem of ACAS—caused largely by some rather mischievous judgments by judges—as an excuse to abandon their responsibilities over recognition. We find this extremely negative, anti-union and unacceptable. What we need to do in the House of Commons, and what I hope that an incoming Labour Government would do, is to support collective bargaining and the spread and development of trade unionism, and to devise an effective system of recognition. I am personally attracted, although it needs to be adapted to our needs, to the approach of the Donovan commission. I believe that we could learn something from Donovan and could usefully go back to that approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I certainly have no hesitation at all in supporting the amendment. I hope that the Government will give at least some indication that they are not abandoning altogether support for any recognition procedures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is one of the most depressing clauses in the Bill. In respect of this group of amendments, we have the Government intending to sweep away, if I may use that well-trodden Tory phrase, "at a stroke" the whole of the statutory procedures for recognition. In the working paper of September 1979, the Government asserted that there was no urgent need for the law to be changed. They said, too, that there was general agreement that the provisions had operated unsatisfactorily. That, the Opposition do not dispute. The provisions certainly have operated unsatisfactorily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government pointed out, too, that there was no consensus on how the situation should be sorted out, and referred to the increasing concern of ACAS over the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1362">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1601</span>
effects of its role in the area of recognition in respect of its voluntary conciliation and advisory function. We know that last June, largely because of the adverse effects of court judgments, ACAS advised the Government that it could not satisfactorily operate the recognition procedures as they stood and explained its difficulties. In the view of many of us, over a period the discretion of ACAS has been seriously limited, indeed, undermined by the courts, as my right hon. Friend said. Its standing and authority has, I suggest, consequently been undermined as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of these judicial interpretations have, I submit, opened the door to claims which have been able to disrupt established bargaining arrangements and have also helped to undermine the TUC's own disputes procedures. That effect certainly concerns the TUC. I want to refer to the TUC's position - because the General Council of the TUC prior to the general election considered—this is not a new issue—a number of possible options for change. These included seeking stronger legal sanctions against recalcitrant and un co-operative employers. The TUC considered the question of greater discretion for ACAS by perhaps bringing the legislation into line with the Northern Ireland legislation on this subject, and of course, by including the abolition of the statutory recognition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All these were options and were discussed with the then Labour Government, but at the time of the election no decisions had been reached. The matter under discussion was complex and difficult. There was no fixed position. What was recognised was that the prime responsibility for the unsatisfactory operation of the recognition procedures lay with the courts, and particularly with the Court of Appeal. In a series of judgments, the Court of Appeal had interpreted the Employment Protection Act, as my right hon. Friend said, in ways which were not intended by Parliament, and certainly were not envisaged by ACAS. Grunwick is only one of a number of cases which fall into that category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The TUC General Council's view subsequently has been that recognition disputes should be resolved by voluntary methods, including conciliation and inquiry, but that an effective statutory procedure could be a useful alternative to what in many instances would be long and damaging industrial disputes. I understand
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1602</span>
that the TUC has told the Government clearly that it is not prepared to conclude that there is no place for statutory procedures for dealing with claims for recognition which cannot be resolved in other ways. The TUC said that if the Government were to show any disposition to agree to seal off recognition provisions from the courts, which is the burden of the other amendment tabled by my right hon. Friend. it would be only too ready to talk to the Government about trying to draw up effective statutory procedures. Obviously there is no disposition on the part of the Government at present to travel that road, so once again we have a brick wall, as it were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the benefits of the statutory procedures mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Radice), it is worth pointing out that by the end of 1979 ACAS had received a total of I,542 references under section 11. I think my figures are a little later than those he quoted. In 959 of those cases, voluntary settlements were reached as a result of the union's application, 479 of those on the basis of some form of recognition of the union. One hundred and eighty-nine final reports under section 12 of the Act had been issued by the end of 1979. Of the 34 final reports issued during 1979, 26 recommended recognition and eight made no recommendation. In two cases—Kings & Company v. MATSA and Wimpey Asphalt Limited v. MATSA, ACAS was prevented from getting the opinions of the workers concerned by the employers' refusal to co-operate, so it did not issue a report. Instead, it issued a statement that it had been debarred from making a recommendation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the statutory procedure came into force in February 1976, taking it up to the end of 1979, some form of collective bargaining has been extended to 46,000 employees as a result of voluntary settlements following union references to ACAS, and to 16,000 employees as a result of references which have gone through the full statutory procedure, ending in final published reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So that is a total of 62,000 employees who have benefited in that way, although one has to remember that a lot of those cases have been settled only on the basis of partial recognition arrangements where the union is given the right to represent individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those benefits—and they are benefits without doubt—were not mentioned in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1363">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1603</span>
consultative document, the working paper, except in the letter from the chairman of ACAS, Mr. Jim Mortimer; nor did that consultative document make any firm proposals for amendment or abolition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once again we are concerned with evidence. It is rather difficult to see what the evidence is on which the Government are basing the decision to go ahead and to Scrap the thing in its entirety. Everyone recognises the acute difficulties for ACAS. Once again we can put on record our confidence in ACAS and the chairman of ACAS. If ACAS is to continue to deal with these matters, it clearly needs additional help. I will suggest in a moment that perhaps ACAS is not the body to deal with these matters, and indeed there are difficulties if it continues to do so, but I will touch on that in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly the statutory provisions cause a lot of difficulties. On the other hand, they can sometimes provide an impetus. This is the experience of using the statutory procedures, but they can provide an impetus where they are not used. They can provide an impetus because they are there towards the achievement of recognition and the extension of collective bargaining where perhaps on occasions a voluntary approach might not work and where, as I said just now, the alternative to that voluntary approach would almost certainly be prolonged industrial strife.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statutory procedure signals the Government's commitment. If the Government maintain it, it will signal Government commitment to furthering collective bargaining. If they turn away from that at this stage, as they seek to do, that is in effect an incitement to employers to resist employees' claims for recognition and to resist agreeing to collective bargaining arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) has already referred to the tone of the Chancellor's speech and to his actual remarks in the Budget statement. That underlines the point that this seems to be the way in which the Government are thinking and the dangerous gamble that they are prepared to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mention has already been made of the Northern Ireland provisions which were, of course, drafted after the Employment Protection Act had been in operation for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1604</span>
a while and took account of the British experience—my right hon. Friend is particularly conversant with that situation. The Northern Ireland Labour Relations Agency has broad discretion to take up recognition issues where it thinks that it should do so, and it has a relatively free hand in making its inquiries and recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is certainly worth considering further whether similar provisions to give a British agency that sort of flexibility would be desirable so that it could be allowed to consider fully the industrial relations implications of going ahead with an inquiry where it thought that perhaps the existing negotiating arrangements might be fragmented, where industrial relations difficulties might be caused if it went ahead with an inquiry, and so on. It would have that flexibility of deciding whether to go ahead. That is certainly worth a great deal further thought and consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such an agency would also need a right to override an employer's refusal to cooperate by providing access to employees' names and addresses. That seems to me something else which must be taken on board. If that means sanctions against an employer who refused to grant recognition to a recommended union, I think that one might have to travel that path as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go into detail on sanctions because there would be bound to be problems. If the CAC, for instance, had the power to award compensation to a union for a denial of negotiating rights, we are bound to be asked about appeals and challenges in the courts which might arise. That is why new clause 15 seeks to protect that situation and to keep these matters away from the courts. There is room for a great deal of discussion on that issue, but we are not getting it. It has not been mentioned in that way so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one gets into the area of sanctions, ACAS itself might be very unhappy that its traditional functions would be damaged. I made a passing reference to the possibility—I put it no higher than that—of considering whether a separate agency might be better—that is the sort of thing where an ACAS view, if it could reach a view, would be worth canvassing—or perhaps something linked to ACAS and operating autonomously. There is a whole variety of formulae, and I think it would be foolish to be dogmatic on the method.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is even more foolish is the at-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1364">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1605</span>
titude of the Government in this situation where they are prepared to throw out the baby with the bathwater. That is what we are complaining about. There should be some statutory provision for arbitration to be used unilaterally by unions against recalcitrant employers, and we on this side of the Committee are clear in our minds to that extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is plenty of room for discussion and, as I said earlier, I am sure that if the Government showed that they were open to discussion on these matters, the TUC would respond. Certainly if the hon. and learned Gentleman was prepared to give us some assistance in that direction, I do not think that anybody on our side of the Committee would crow about it. We would welcome that as a very desirable conversion. I think that the Government in this situation are making a very sad and a very serious error. The damage that they may do may not be irreparable, but I have no doubt that we shall have to come back to sort it out in due course. However, it will be damaging, and I think that, with only very little common sense on the part of the Government and a bit of a rethink even at this late stage, that kind of damage could be avoided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to make a contribution, but I must confess that I was slightly stung into action by the words of the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) when he quoted highly selectively from the Budget speech yesterday of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor. I have the speech before me and I agree that he said those words, but the right hon. Gentleman omitted the preceding words where my right hon. and learned Friend said that in the past
	<br><q><p>"we often paid no more than lip service to the role of private enterprise and to the importance of economic change as an agent of prosperity."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 26 March 1980; Vol. 981, c. 1440.]</p></q>
I genuinly believe that it must be the smaller business sector upon which we have to rely to bring about the regeneration of our economy. I am delighted at the whole raft of economic measures which have been brought forward for this sector to follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcomed the comments of the hon. Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Radice) about the problems of small firm recognition within ACAS, although I was not stung into action. I do not want to be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1606</span>
derogatory about ACAS. It does a marvellous job. However, it tends to be oriented towards the big battalions—the CBI, the TUC and one or two academics on the council. If it is to be involved more closely with smaller business recognition problems, these should be greater representation of that area of our economy. I do not accept that the representation of the CBI smaller firms section is enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already mentioned the value of this sector in our economy. My hon. and learned Friend replied to a question that I put the other day regarding the number of days lost through strikes in firms employing between five and 20 people. The number was infinitesimal. It could not really be calculated. It was estimated to be less than 1 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my hon. and learned Friend to reject the amendment and to stick to our original proposals because this section of the market becomes too legalistic and too complicated. The voluntary method of sorting out our problems is the best. Smaller firms do not want stylised and ritualised procedures. The problems of recognition could be discussed far more effectively and genuinely on a voluntary basis around the table rather than by possibly going through the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am attracted by the idea—for the most part I agree with it—that we should solve our problems by voluntary means. However, if the small business sector grows—indeed, if trade unionism grows—we are likely to have more trade union recognition issues. It is important that they should be solved by peaceful means and not through unpleasant, bitter disputes. The purpose of having a statutory right is to avoid cases of employer resistance to trade unions that are not organised. I hope that such cases are rare. The good record of the small business sector in the number of days lost could be maintained by having a statutory right. The hon. Gentleman ought to take that on board before he concludes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the line of reasoning that prompted the hon. Gentleman to make that remark, but I assure him that there is a tremendous fear within sectors of our industry of trade unionism being foisted upon them rather than it coming in through voluntary methods. The hon. Gentleman referred to Grunwick, which did great harm to the trade union

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1607</span>
movement and made more employers resistant to trade unionism. They thought "That might happen in my firm. Gosh, I do not want it anywhere near me."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the small business sector, to which Britain has to look for its economic salvation, I far prefer the voluntary negotiated method to the ritualised, stylised court procedures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of the amendment is to restore to the law the entire recognition procedure embodied in the Employment Protection Act. The purpose of the new clause evidently is to ensure that any recommendation for recognition shall not be removable into any court of law, by which I think that it is meant that the judges shall not be able to get at any recommendation for recognition made by ACAS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have all started in the Committee from common ground that the present procedures for recognition are seriously defective. No one has sought to argue to the contrary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is noticeable from Opposition speeches that there is an absence of suggestions as to what shall replace the present provisions. There are broad ideas that perhaps some other body should replace ACAS, or that there should be greater powers to deal with recalcitrant employers, which suggestion came from the hon. Member for Chester-le-Street. That idea was convincingly disapproved of in the TUC General Council's report of 1979. Page 26 of that report states that stronger legal sanctions on recalcitrant employers should not be sought, as these would increase, for example, the scope for judicial intervention in trade disputes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever is identified as being defective in our present system is likely to be reproduced if some other statutory body is put up in substitution for ACAS. The root of the problem is that there is no agreement, and ACAS itself has not been able to come to an agreement on what should be the criteria for a recommendation for recognition. The problems which have been identified include inter-union disputes raised during a recognition issue, or which perhaps give rise to recognition disputes, a challenge to Bridlington, a failure to agree between employers and unions on criteria to determine recognition disputes, and employer opposition to what is seen as bias in the procedure. Reference has been
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1608</span>
made to Grunwick. Finally, there is the problem of the lack of co-operation in many recognition disputes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been made clear that ACAS wants out. It cannot cope with this procedure. We attached to our working paper brought out last summer the letter from the Chairman, Mr. Mortimer, dated June, which made clear that increasingly ACAS was meeting difficulties in operating this part of its jurisdiction. The word used was "increasingly". The reason was an absence of agreement among the members of the council, or ACAS officials, on what criteria should constitute, for example, proper bargaining units. Therefore, some change is essential. The question is whether there should be a further statutory body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) asked whether the Government could indicate they are prepared to consider a further statutory body. There is a deep belief, which the TUC is said to share, that that is correct and that there should be a statutory fallback, although we all agree that voluntary resolution of these recognition issues is much to be preferred. I cannot give an assurance that the Government believe that some other body will be a better substitution. We think that that would merely shunt the problem sideways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision of guidance by ACAS on the principles—in so far as this can be done—that should guide the resolution of recognition disputes is something that we welcome. We are prepared to think about it seriously. There is scope for the sort of guidance that ACAS gives in other contexts and we hope that this body may be able to give its mind to that. We believe that voluntary means have proved most effective. As has already been said, about 75 per cent. of all the cases of this nature that ACAS has resolved have been dealt with in its general advisory capacity, under section 3 of the Employment Protection Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not it rather curious for the hon. and learned Gentleman to say, on the one hand, that the powers should be scrapped because there are no criteria, and on the other hand to say "We should like ACAS to give us guidance on the criteria", having scrapped it? Is not that putting the cart before the horse?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I said that in so far as it was able to do so we should welcome guidance that ACAS felt able to give. The

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1609</span>
problem that ACAS has faced, which is very clearly set out in Mr. Mortimer's letter, is that it has not been able to agree upon criteria in a sufficiently clear way to enable it to provide recommendations in many of these cases. There is no doubt about that. Everybody understands that that is so. Hon. Members have only to look at ACAS's last annual report:
	<br><q><p>"It is essential for the effective discharge of the Service's role in conciliation on industrial disputes and in giving advice to employers and trade unions that the independence and the impartiality of the Service should be generally accepted."</p></q>
This was recognised by Parliament when it established ACAS.
	<br><q><p>"The Service's traditional third party role in conciliation and the provision of advice is essentially voluntary. To perform this role effectively the Service needs maximum flexibility in bringing its industrial relations expertise to bear upon the problems brought to it by employers and trades unions. This essentially voluntary role does not sit easily with the statutory duties in sections 11 to 16 of the Employment Protection Act."</p></q>
That is from the report of ACAS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If ACAS is having that difficulty, and we know it is, is there not a responsibility on the Government to deal with the criteria? When we were talking about picketing and when it was clear that ACAS would not be interested in drawing up a code of practice on picketing, we were told that the Government would get on and do the job. When we come to this situation, the Government turn their back and run away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhem</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find that a curious argument from an hon. Gentleman who never ceases to remind us that these matters of industrial relations must be dealt with by those who have long practical experience. Yet here he is saying that those who exactly fall into that category, set up by his own Government in 1975 to fulfil this very function, are defeated and therefore the Government must step in and do what they have proved unable to achieve. That simply will not do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not blame ACAS or its members. I agree entirely with what has been said. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, South-West (Mr. Page) said, ACAS performs a marvellous job. But we have asked it to do the impossible, for the reason that questions of recognition and the merits of an application for recog-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1610</span>
nition vary infinitely with the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is impossible for the Government to lay down criteria that will be accepted by all concerned as being valid and proper—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] There are shouts that this is what we have been doing everywhere else—but time and time again what I have been insisting on is that the industrial tribunal can be relied upon to discern what is reasonably practicable in, for example, of unfair dismissal cases. That is one thing. Unfortunately we have asked ACAS, with its tripartite constitution, to do the impossible. It has now told us that it is impossible, and it is the responsibility of Government to decide what ought to be done next.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the problem that ACAS has been facing is not so much that it is impossible to lay down sensible and reasonable criteria in recognition cases. This is done in other countries. Why should it be so impossible in Britain? That is not the difficulty. The difficulty is that ACAS is a tripartite body which has employers on it, and the employers are not so keen on the recognition procedures. That is the problem, as well as the judicial interpretations which have driven a gaping hole in the legislation. A combination of that makes ACAS's job impossible. That is all that ACAS has been saying to the Government. It has been throwing it back into the Government's lap. In all the other instances the Government are always taking responsibility—on balloting, on picketing, on closed shops—but in this one instance they are not taking any responsibility at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can readily see that if we follow the solution proposed by the hon. Gentleman, of excluding employers from the role of advice and recommendation on ACAS—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman did not say that, I suggest that it was implicit. Perhaps he did not mean it. I shall assume in his favour that he did not mean it, but it appeared to be implicit that when he said that the difficulty had come from the presence of employers on ACAS he was suggesting that ACAS should be reconstituted in this particular jurisdiction without them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say anything about excluding the employers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman did not, it does him credit, because we certainly could not go down that kind of road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to the point I made, that the vast majority of cases that have been settled by ACAS have been settled under the voluntary procedures. The figures are as follows. Up to October 1979, since the current procedure was introduced in February, 1,511 cases have been referred, 928 have been settled or withdrawn, 208 have been the subject of formal reports and in 22 cases draft reports are being considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the large number of issues settled in the course of proceedings under the 1976 Act, the best estimate of the extension of collective bargaining achieved is that given by the chairman of ACAS in his letter to the Secretary of State on 29 June setting out ACAS's counsel's views on the statutory procedure. He said that by the end of 1978, some form of collective bargaining had been extended to 40,000 employees covered by references settled and withdrawn, and to 10,000 through references on which it had issued a report and a formal recommendation. In fact, over 80 per cent. of all references which have been completed have been settled voluntarily without going to a formal report. He said that many more references of recognition issues were made under the voluntary provisions of the Act—about half as many again, in fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that that indicates that these matters can be resolved by agreement, but they cannot be resolved by the procedures that ACAS is required to adopt. Therefore, simply to say by way of an amendment that we must put it all back is not a practicable step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been said by the right hon. Gentleman, I thought very regrettably, about perverse decisions on the part of the judges; it is in order to prevent these that the new clause is put forward. Before I part from that, I must deal with this aspect of the amendment. I recognise the anxieties expressed by smaller trade unions that this will, as it were, represent a return to the law of the jungle and that they will not be able to secure recognition if there is no statutory procedure. One must acknowledge that concern has been forcibly expressed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1612</span>
to us. But I revert to the point that I have just made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We talk about the law of the jungle, but what we really mean is whether or not agreement can be reached voluntarily. When the vast majority of cases that have been resolved through the intervention of ACAS have been resolved voluntarily and under the advisory jurisdiction, and we note that that will continue to be available when sections 11 to 16 are repealed, I believe that that offers great hope that even the smaller unions can secure a proper hearing for their claims and that they will not be shut out in the way that they have, for understandable reasons, supposed may be the case.

The hon. Gentleman is seeking to exclude the judges from having any sort of surveying role over ACAS. I listened with great interest to his reflections upon the class structure of the judges. I do not think that he can know many of them if he thinks that they are all recruited from the privileged classes. I should not have thought that Lord Denning would fall into that category; nor would very many others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. and learned Gentleman cite a single High Court judge who has ever worked in industry with his hands?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that there was more than one, but I do not know. I do not know that it necessarily makes one a better High Court judge to have worked on the shop floor, any more than it makes one a better operator of a lathe machine to have been a High Court judge. Not even the Central Arbitration Committee would impose such terms and conditions.

The right hon. Gentleman reflected upon the gaslights of the Temple. I should have liked to see him making his stately way up Middle Temple Lane. I should have thought that the right hon. Gentleman would have fitted into the Dickensian scene very congruously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is being said is that Parliament is to be seen as a great contrast to the outdated archaic scene in the Temple. Let us reflect on what happens. The contrast is painted between the perverse judges, with their out-of-touch background, defying the wishes of a modern, up-to-date Parliament that knows the practicalities. But how do we dress out Speaker? We dress him in knee-breeches. What do we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1368">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1613</span>
do when we wish to sit alone? We say that we spy strangers. What about the House of Lords? It is hardly the most up-to-date institution. Yet there is no more fervent opponent of reform of the House of Lords than the party that the right hon. Gentleman supports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must look at the substance and not the form. The serious point—its seriousness must not be overlaid by the more frivolous sidelights that we throw upon it—is that when Parliament establishes any body that has rights over the freedoms of our fellow subjects the courts will always survey the exercise of that power. That is what is meant by the rule of law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is defective in that it will not meet the hon. Gentleman's purpose, because it relates only to recommendations for recognition. It has no bearing on other matters. It does not cover the manner in which ACAS conducts its inquiries, ascertains the opinions of workers or issues a report refusing recognition. Of the six actions taken against ACAS in the courts in respect of these provisions, only one has concerned an ACAS decision to recommend a union for recognition. The others have been about the way in which it has conducted its inquiries or deferred them, or its refusal to recommend a union for recognition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause would therefore not prevent judicial review, nor should it. Judicial review is an accepted and fundamental part of our constitution, though not in the sense of the court setting itself up as an appeal court on the merits of a claim for recognition. The Act does not permit that. The courts do not seek to do that. But what they seek to do and must ever continue to do, I trust, is to ensure that the powers which have been given by Parliament are properly exercised and not abused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen referred to the 1913 Trade Union Act, which employed the wording that is imported into the new clause. It provided that
	<br><q><p>"any such order of the Registrar shall be binding and conclusive on all parties without appeal and shall not be removable into any court of law or restrainable by injunction".</p></q>
As far as I know, that was never tested, but it would not have achieved what the right hon. Gentleman hopes. It was repealed by the right hon. Gentleman's Government in the 1975 Act, when the jurisdiction was transferred to the certification officer. When I pointed that out to the right hon. Gentleman this morning, he
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1614</span>
said that it was repealed because it was no longer necessary. The interesting point is that he did not remind us that an appeal against the certification officer's decision was given in that Act to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was only making the point, when I referred to the Act, that if anyone sought to challenge the idea of imposing such words as we have in our new clause into an Act of Parliament, suggesting that somehow it was either unprecedented or inconsistent with the purpose of the statute, there were respectable precedents. I merely happened to choose that particular precedent because it was the only one that I had in mind. But I told the hon. and learned Gentleman, as I am sure his officials will confirm, that there were examples in other statutes where matters were excluded from review by the courts. I did not make the point to encourage the Minister to go on about the purpose of the 1913 Act. It was merely an example of a statute that contained such a provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is correct. There have been one or two occasions when Parliament has been so misguided as to try to exclude the courts from any review of the exercise of power. But to my knowledge these have never worked. One of them was the 1974 Housing Act, which gave county courts the power to determine whether any work completed by a tenant amounted to a structural alteration, and went on to say that that determination was to be final and conclusive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A section of the County Courts Act 1959 provided that no order of the court could be removable by 	<i>certiorari</i> or otherwise into any other court. That did not prevent the Court of Appeal ruling that 	<i>certiorari</i> lay in cases where it felt that the county court judge's decision on the meaning of the phrase "structural alteration" went outside his jurisdiction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The courts cannot be excluded in this way, nor should they be. I believe that one should approach the matter in this way. We acknowledge that things have gone badly wrong and that this part of the Act is not working. What are we to do? Are we to shift it sideways to some other body? In my view, the answer is that we should not do so until we can agree on a group of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1369">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1615</span>
criteria which will meet with the respect and agreement of all sides of industry. So far that has eluded the people who are surely best fitted to find that particular formula.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alternatively, we could say "Let matters now become voluntary only. Let ACAS continue to use its advisory jurisdiction, which it has used with signal success in about 80 per cent. of all the cases that it has had a hand in resolving." By all means, too, let us encourage ACAS to give such guidance as it feels is possible. But let us not try to exclude the courts from any surveillance or supervisory role over the exercise of any powers that we confer upon anybody. If we start down that road we are undermining the rule of law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I acknowledge the anxieties of right hon. and hon. Gentlemen, and do not pretend that this is in any way a simple matter to which there are simple answers, I believe that on balance the Government are right in relieving ACAS, as it has asked to be relieved, of this jurisdiction. In the circumstances I advise my hon. Friends to vote against the amendment and against the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric G. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that this clause may have caused more anxiety to the Department of Employment than any other. I suspect, too, that there has been great argument about whether the Government should go ahead with the proposal, with perhaps the Under-Secretary being the chap in favour. He probably had to persuade his other ministerial colleagues, including the Secretary of State himself, to agree, because on Second Reading the Secretary of State said:
	<br><q><p>"I should say that I am not wholly unsympathetic to the idea of some statutory recognition provision."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 December 1979; Vol. 976, c. 69.]</p></q>
There has therefore been some wobbling on this subject. The hon. and learned Gentleman in his reply has not convinced me, nor, I suspect, has he convinced my right hon. and hon. Friends, that it is right to get rid of sections 11 to 16 of the Act. The Minister has not been at all convincing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman suggested that one of the reasons for coming to this conclusion was the letter that the Government received from ACAS. My hon. Friends have already explained that we recognise that sections 11 to 16 have not worked perfectly, but that is no reason
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1616</span>
for abolition. If they have not worked perfectly the Government should tell the Committee and the House exactly how they hope to improve the procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, the hon. Gentleman should not misrepresent the views of ACAS. As I understand the letter—I have not got it before me at the moment, but I have read it—ACAS has not put forward the reason for abolition totally that it is having difficulty in interpreting the recognition procedure. It may well be that it wants to put it onto another body. I do not know. ACAS has not told me that. ACAS has not suggested in that letter and in the representations made to the Government that sections 11 to 16 should be repealed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the reason ACAS has some difficulty about this is that it is frustrated by—as one of my hon. Friends said elsewhere—the judicial adventurism that has taken place over the years and how the courts have deliberately made law and have in no way had regard to the discussions that took place in Committee when the 1975 Bill was going through the House of Commons. My right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) explained that the ground was gone over fairly thoroughly at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know how certain members of the judiciary—I am not making an attack on them; I am merely going to quote their words—do not like the growth of trade unions and their activities. Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls, told a journalist on 20 April last year in Canada that the unions had grown too powerful in Britain and were almost above the law because of the statutes introduced by the Labour Government in 1974. That often-quoted phrase is not a particularly judicious or impartial statement which Lord Denning made outside this country to a foreign journalist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that ACAS has been frustrated in its attitude in some recognition cases. The other factor is that it really says something about the philosophy of certain members of the Government: they do not like the growth of trade unionism--full stop. That came out in the television programme on Saturday which involved Mr. Milton Friedman, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Healey), because, in examining the economy at that stage and some of the problems besetting our economy and the economic difficulties, the Chancellor of the Exchequer
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1370">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1617</span>
said that in the United States only 25 per cent. of the work force was in the trade unions, whereas here the percentage is nearly 50 per cent., and that was one of the factors. That is generally in keeping with the theme that the Government do not like the growth of the trade unions and would like to restrict it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They do not want to destroy it totally. We heard that from one of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They do not want to destroy it totally, but they do not like to see the growth. They cannot do anything about the growth within the public service sector, for example. The hon. Gentleman would be the last person to deny some recognition within the Civil Service, because of all the torment that would arise there. Certainly, when it comes to the electricity supply, gas or the National Coal Board they do not want to do anything about that. But—from the party, by the way, that says that it tries to protect minorities—when it comes to small groups of people who are seeking recognition from some very regressive and reactionary employers, they say "No, let us see that none of that can take place. Let us withdraw these statutory recognition procedures." That is precisely what they are doing at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is part of some of the other philosophy of this Bill—maternity rights, the unfair dismissal procedures, the two classes of employee, those who work for small companies, when it comes to unfair dismissal, and those who work for larger companies. It is not good enough for the hon. and learned Gentleman to tell us that ACAS is not happy with this and would like to see it abolished and that other organisations within the country would like to see it go. That is not true, it is a misrepresentation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also said that the TUC implied in its 1979 annual report, that it would like to see this go. The TUC has not said anything of the kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quoted the following passage:
	<br><q><p>"The general view of unions was that stronger legal sanctions on recalcitrant employers should not be sought as these would increase the scope for judicial intervention in trade disputes."</p></q>
I mentioned that in response to the point in the contrary sense made by the hon. Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Radice).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1618</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point and stand corrected. But by no means can the hon. and learned Gentleman read into that that the TUC is in favour of the repeal of sections 11 to 16. It did not seek to do so. I do not want to misrepresent it. On the contrary, I should have thought that the TUC was extremely unhappy about the repeal of these provisions. In any event, I think that it will cause great difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will be the impact on our industrial relations if this amendment is not conceded by the Government? My judgment is that there will be more recognition disputes. There will be more Grunwicks—I hate to use the word—but that kind of dispute could arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the reason that ACAS has had such reasonable success on the basis of voluntary guidance is the existence of back-up statutory powers. If the back-up to the statutory powers did not exist, I am sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman would not be able to give us the great catalogue of successes that it has had. To assume that if we wipe away the statutory back-up powers the voluntary arrangements will go ahead smoothly is not necessarily correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman realises that, so I ask him to think again about this. If the Secretary of State is to be taken at face value when he says that he is sympathetic to the idea of some statutory recognition provision, at least if he cannot come forward with something, there is no reason to get rid of these provisions and to leave a great vacuum. The Government should think again about this, and not get rid of these provisions, particularly if they want to protect minorities and small groups of people working for relatively small employers. If they want to avoid industrial disputes they will look at this again. I hope that my hon. Friends will press the Minister further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 16(	<i>b</i>), which we are seeking to delete, can probably fairly be described as the Grunwick section of the Bill or the Ward-Gorst payoff for what took place in the last 18 months of the Labour Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South-West (Mr. Page) said that what happened would damage the trade union movement. There is an argument about that. He is right in one sense—that it did not bring much credit to the trade union
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1371">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1619</span>
movement. But some would suspect that that was what the whole thing was about, to bring discredit to the trade union movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the real lesson to be learnt from Grunwick, which obviously the Tory Government are utterly incapable of doing, is to recognise the very deep-seated feelings aroused among working people in relation to recognition issues. It was in that context that the Labour Government attempted to solve what had been a longstanding problem. One can go through disputes over many years and see the clear picture emerging that the most bitter, vicious, and often the longest strikes are those in which workers seek to have their union recognised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this context, it would also be useful to try to get Conservative hon. Members, who I am sure have learnt a great deal about the trade union movement during this Committee stage, to understand that in this situation what workers are talking and thinking about is their union, the fact that they have come together, that they have joined another group of people to form a union to seek to protect their rights and to promote their interests. That is why there is such bitter and vicious feeling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard some excellent speeches from the Minister during the course of the Bill but we have also heard some dreadful waffle. When he has no arguments left, he has poured on the syrup and bored us all stiff. His speech this morning falls into that category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legal profession pays its practitioners well. If the hon. and learned Gentleman had taken up medicine and practised in Harley Street, he would probably have been a multi-millionaire by now. He has a magnificent bedside manner. I have a vision of him with the trade union movement stretched out on the bed in front of him while he soothes it and tells it that it will not hurt, as he fills his syringe with a lethal shot of arsenic to pump into it the moment it turns its head. That is what we have had to suffer from this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South-West is unfortunately not with us now. It is a pity. I wish that he were here while I say this. He trotted out the pet line which he has occasionally trotted out
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1620</span>
in the Committee about the magnificent work of the Government for the small business sector. It is audacious of the Tory Party, which has bankrupted so many small businesses in the past 10 months and will bankrupt many more in the next 12 months through its fiscal and economic policies, to suggest that it is the protector of the small business sector and that clause 16 will actually help it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservatives must think that the small business sector has taken leave of its senses. At the last election it was conned by the Tory Party into assuming that it would get benefits, assistance and succour from the Tory Government. But if the small business sector is conned into believing that the Bill will do anything to assist it, and that the mean and petty act of removing sections 11 to 16 of the Employment Protection Act will bring it prosperity, I do not know who is supposed to be living in cloud cuckoo land—the small business sector or Tory Back Benchers, who assume that that is what will happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows that the removal of sections 11 to 16 will not help anybody. I was grateful that my right hon. Friend quoted the remarks of the Secretary of State on Second Reading, because it is obvious that the Secretary of State is very wary about what he is doing here. My right hon. Friend is right.The Secretary of State has been persuaded in this respect by the Under-Secretary to put this in as another part of the hoped-for conning of the small business sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That thread runs right through the Tory Party at the moment. Of course, Mr. Good-hew, I exempt you, as Chairman, from that criticism. I am sure that you will accept that. But I cannot help turning to the magnificent two-hour lecture which the Chancellor of the Exchequer gave us yesterday. He used a most misleading word when he said "finally." All our hearts lifted at that moment. We did not realise that he would go on for another 28 appalling columns of the 	<i>Official Report.</i> He said:—
	<br><q><p>"Finally, I turn to an area where our social security system touches on industrial relations. More than 10 years ago one of my distinguished predecessors said:
	<br><q><p>'we need to facilitate the smooth working of the process of collective bargaining in industry and to help to prevent the occurrence of unnecessary and damaging disputes, of which we have seen all too much recently, and which are totally incompatible with our economic object	<i>ives.'—[Official Report,</i> 15 April 1969; Vol. 781, c. 1006.]</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1372">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1621</span>
That is what Mr. Roy Jenkins said in 1969, when he announced the then Government's intention to press ahead with the proposals, 'In Place of Strife'. Eleven years later, little indeed has changed, except for the worse."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 26 March 1980; Vol. 981, c. 1462.]</p></q>
Flow do the Government intend to improve the situation? I leave on one side the mean and petty attack upon those involved in the democratic right to strike, because I might be straying out of order, and that is the last thing I want to do, as you know, Mr. Goodhew. The Government propose to improve industrial relations not only by producing this dreadful Bill, but by cutting out a genuine attempt to solve some of the most vicious and bitter strikes that we are seeing in our society—those involving recognition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the 1975 Act was not perfect. The Government should bear in mind that it was the first serious attempt to put legislation on the statute book. In those circumstances it was understandable that the measure did not quite work out and needed amending later. I wholeheartedly agree with the remarks made about the legal profession by my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker). I read again the relevant sections particularly section 14, of that Act and for the life of me I cannot see how any judge, who claims to be learned, could have arrived at the decision reached in respect of Grunwick and the recognition issue. By doing so, the judge drove a great hole through that important section of the 1975 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we sat in Committee on that Bill, we never dreamt that at some stage a judge would put that weird interpretation on the clause which we had spent to so many hours discussing. I remind the Committee that some of my hon. Friends, including my hon. Friends the Members for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher) and Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) promoted Private Member's Bills to plug some of the holes that had suddenly appeared in the Employment Protection Act. On that occasion I did not notice the Tory Party giving much help. I suspect that I should be right in saying that the proposals were totally blocked by the Tory Party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Tory Government's answer to the genuine problems that have appeared in connection with the operation of clauses 11 to 16, is to sweep them away, rather than trying to amend them. They do not try to seek common ground. They do not come to the Committee or even to a Select Com-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1622</span>
mittee, to ask how to put right some of the damage that has been created by a strange legal interpretation of clauses 11 to 16, and particularly clause 14. All the Government say is "Remove it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked about the voluntary basis being best. Naturally, a voluntary basis is better, goodness knows why the hon. and learned Gentleman went on so long about it. If all problems could be solved on a voluntary basis, we should not be sitting in the Committee discussing this ridiculous Bill. All problems would be solved by the two sides of industry coming together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason that Parliament spends so much time—and some of the public think that each time Parliament does not agree, the situation is made worse, not better—on employment legislation, is that the disputes are difficult. For some reason, Parliament thinks that it knows better than men and women on the workshop floor and those who employ them, and that Parliament can put the matter right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 16, will make the situation infinitely worse. I have no doubt that my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) will be proved right quickly in his reference to the widespread rash of strikes that will take place in respect of recognition disputes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard about the letter received by the Minister from ACAS, indicating that it wanted out of this situation. My hon. Friend the Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Radice) answered that remark perfectly by saying that it is the employers who are involved with ACAS who want out. They do not want to be involved. Like the Tory Government, they want to load the dice against the trade union movement. They do not welcome a situation in which an organisation can come in, offer its best services, take a ballot of its members, and discover information through a secret ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We spent many hours on clause I arguing about the State providing money for ballots of workers. State money for ballots through ACAS could perform a valuable service, but the answer of the Government is not only not to provide money, but to take the service away altogether. That will soon be proved to be a retrograde step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister uses phrases such as "It is essential that the Government are seen to be fair and that legislation is seen to be fair and that we can recognise it to be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1373">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1623</span>
fair." It is a bit much that, when we have been through the Bill clause by clause and have attempted time after time to write in amendments to show that Parliament was trying to be fair and even-handed, the hon. and learned Gentleman and his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State should reject all our attempts. Unless the Minister were to give us the Bill and ask us to rewrite it, I do not think that we could make it fair and even-handed. But on every single occasion when we have tried to do so, the Under-Secretary and the Secretary of State have rejected our attempts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will not be in the interests of industry or industrial relations for us to be able to say, in a few months' time, that we have been proved right—a fact which we shall undoubtedly ram down the Minister's throat during employment questions for the rest of the year. Unfortunately, that will be the situation. The Secretary of State has only just come into the Committee. Looking at his statements on Second Reading we felt strongly that he was not persuaded of the wisdom of removing sections 11 to 16, but has allowed himself to be persuaded by either his Under-Secretary or his hawkish colleagues in the Cabinet. I do not suppose that he will tell us which.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. James Prior)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have the reputation nowadays for being a wet hawk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought for a moment that the Secretary of State was about to advise us who had persuaded him—his Under-Secretary or the Prime Minister. We shall have to wait until he writes his diaries to find out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister tried to establish that it is necessary to get rid of these provisions because ACAS wants out—the phrase from American television—and that ACAS is frustrated. It is put in an impossible position and wants to get out of it as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that ACAS finds its position impossible, but that is not because it objects to the wording of the 1975 Act or because the governing body of ACAS does not wish to pursue claims for recognition. The position has been made impossible because the judgments of the courts have made its task almost impossible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The classic example is Grunwick. One can recall that when the management of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1624</span>
Grunwick took action through the courts, the courts at every stage supported the unions and supported ACAS. Indeed, Lord Scarman's committee of inquiry also supported the unions and ACAS. It was not until the case got to the House of Lords that we had a political judgment that ACAS had not carried out its statutory duty and had not taken all reasonable steps to ascertain the views of the workers employed at Grunwick.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What could ACAS do? It had contacted every employee that it could, and in the main they were the employees on strike. It was not allowed to go into the factory to talk to the people there. It was not supplied by the management with a list of addresses. It did everything that was reasonably possible to ascertain the views of the workers. But we got a politically prejudiced view from the Law Lords that it had not carried out the provisions of the Act. Hon. Members will recall that my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) and I introduced Private Member's Bills to bring the Act into such a condition that the Law Lords would not be able to challenge it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. He announced with great certainty that the Law Lords' judgment was politically prejudiced. What is the evidence for that and how is that consistent with the recent decisions in favour of ACAS in the UKASE and the EMA cases?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I base my claim on the fact that I have not read the full reports, but only the law reports that appeared in 	<i>The Times.</i> Statements were made during the discussion of the Grunwick case before the decision was reached. The sort of phrases used were "the hordes of trade unionists congregating outside the gates" and "The unions are holding a knife to the jugular vein of Mr. Ward."

Any impartial observer would say that the Law Lords were politically prejudiced, that they had to sort out the goodies from the baddies, that the trade unions were the baddies and that, as a consequence, a political decision was given against them. So ACAS is frustrated not by a section of the 1975 Act but by the legal decisions that are being given. As a consequence, ACAS is being attacked. An attempt is being made
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1374">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1625</span>
to remove ACAS from all sorts of disputes that involve the question of recognition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State used to have a different view of the valuable work that ACAS has done. I quote from a public statement that he issued on 30 March 1977:
	<br><q><p>"A report on the Grunwick dispute by ACAS has now been published. The ACAS council, including both employers and trade unionists, have recommended that the management should recognise APEX for collective bargaining purposes. I hope that the report will be accepted, that picketing and blacking will end and that there will be a full restoration of normal working. All concerned should remember that it was the will of Parliament that the advice issued by ACAS should be legal."</p></q>
The Secretary of State was fully behind ACAS. He supported the efforts that it had made to ascertain the views of workers. He supported the report that had been issued. Before the case had been prejudiced by the hearing in the House of Lords the right hon. Gentleman said to the management of Grunwick that they should accept the ACAS report and let people return to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary's hostile attitude is in direct contrast to the attitude of the Secretary of State. The hon. and learned Gentleman is taking the view that ACAS has little to do with questions of recognition and that therefore we can get rid of this section of the 1975 Act without damage. The Secretary of State takes the view that ACAS has done valuable work on recognition issues, and the number of cases that have been resolved without acrimony or industrial strife are numerous. We shall be taking one step away from better industrial relations if we agree to the Government's proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is obvious that the Government have not taken into consideration what is likely to happen if ACAS cannot in future take an active part in recognition disputes. It is not difficult to predict what attitude the trade unions will take. As my hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) emphasised, the question of trade union recognition is fundamental to all trade unionists. The trade union movement has adopted the policy from its inception that no worker shall be dismissed from his or her employment as a result of joining a trade union. That is the basis of trade union membership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trade unions march with their banners, on which are inscribed "Unity is Strength", and "Each for all and all for each". They are not meaningless slogans.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1626</span>
Trade unionists will rally round to help their colleagues who have been unfairly dismissed for joining a trade union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Legislation, such as the Bill, designed to end secondary picketing, or at least to make it much more difficult, is likely to give a new impetus to secondary picketing. I assure the Government that if ACAS is not allowed to intervene in recognition cases, there will be secondary picketing. There may be a boycott of the goods manufactured by a firm which will not recognise a trade union. There may be a denial of trade unionists' services to that firm. For example, at Grunwick for a while, post office workers refused to deliver letters. There are certain to be mass demonstrations by trade unionists if they think that the clock is to be put back more than 100 years and that we shall return to the days when trade unionists were victimised or sacked merely because they wanted to remain members of a trade union. All sorts of difficulties will arise for the Government if they deprive ACAS of the right to intervene in questions of trade union recognition. I hope that they will think carefully before they take the issue to a conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that sections 11 to 16 of the 1975 Act could be improved. Parliamentarians should be engaged, particularly on trade union legislation, in drawing Bills so tightly that the law cannot get its teeth into them. We have failed to do that, not only in trade union legislation. The Treasury Ministers know that when a Bill on tax is enacted some clever lawyers will devise a method of getting round it. The Government then have to introduce another Bill to stop that tax evasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a constant battle between the law and the administrators. It will be a difficult task—but one which must be attempted—to draw up as tightly as possible a law under which there is no dubiety, so that it can be carried into effect without the constant frustrations that have taken place over many years between the interpretation of the law and the intentions of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when a Labour Government are returned and we introduce our legislation, this measure will be repealed. I hope that the 1975 Act will be tightened in such a way that the trade unions will know where they stand, and the law will know that there is no possibility of intervening or misinterpreting Parliament's intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Government take action they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1375">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1627</span>
should ask what will be the cost to industrial relations. It will clearly lead to acrimony between trade unions and employers. It will lead, as the case of Grunwick showed plainly, to thousands, indeed tens of thousands, of workers demonstrating to show their anger that under a Government who proudly proclaims their belief in freedom, people are being denied the freedom to join a trade union unless they are also prepared to accept the possibility that they will be sacked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all those reasons I hope that the Government will consider carefully the steps that they propose to take on the road to embittering labour relations. I hope that before it is too late, they will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee, but I should like to make a few comments on what has been said. I do not want to spend time on the case of Grunwick, but simply to put the record straight for the hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher). Only one judge took the side of ACAS. That was in the High Court. Eight other judges, three in the Court of Appeal and five in the House of Lords, ruled unanimously on the case, and I do not believe that there can be any doubt about the way in which the interpretation of the law had to be made in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth is that in all the remarks about the Grunwick dispute made by Labour Members, one-half of the content was prejudiced and the other half was misinformation. Therefore the remarks should be discounted on those grounds alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause in particular, and the Bill in general, shows that the Opposition's attitude towards the proposed reforms is similar to the attitude of the wrongdoer who complains that the police and the courts are being brought into operation, and intervening between him and his victim. In this case, because the wrongdoer is the trade union movement, the police and the courts are Parliament, and the victims are the employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It ought to be recognised that when Labour Members oppose the Bill, they are poor witnesses because they are defending a vested interest. [	<i>Hon. Members:</i> "What about the hon. Gentleman?"] That should be borne in mind, in particular, when we resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1628</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not dwell on what the hon. Gentleman has said, except to say that many people in the House could be accused of pursuing vested interests, and I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman is the best person to talk about that topic, in view of his involvement in the Grunwick dispute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot even find anyone to second his amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. My hon. Friend is right. The hon. Gentleman is a figure in splendid isolation in the Committee, and we are grateful for that. I am sure that the Minister would not want these amendments to pass without thanking me for managing to bring the Committee more up to date with the figures on the successful track record of ACAS than he was able to present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman sought to suggest that I have been inconsistent, because I remarked that since on all the other matters that we have discussed on the Bill, irrespective of ACAS, the Government had been prepared to talk about doing their own thing, producing a code of practice on picketing, the closed shop and so on, that might be necessary in terms of the criteria for recognition. I suggested that the Government might consider the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seemed to think that that was inconsistent, but it was not, because when, in our earlier debates, my right hon. and hon. Friends and I had been arguing against the Government doing those things, we were doing so against the background of the TUC having produced guidelines which were acceptable not only to the TUC, but to the Government of the day and were enshrined in an agreement which was published as a joint agreement between the Government and the trade union movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an essential distinction and I can say to the hon. and learned Gentleman only that as our debates have gone on he has become more and more a walking-talking anomaly. In this situation there is a serious anomaly facing the Government because there is no reason why, if ACAS is finding its task impossible—and we know that it is—the Government should not make efforts, although they might not be successful, to resolve that difficulty. That is what Governments are for: to come in on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1376">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1629</span>
difficult occasions and to sort them out. ACAS has said that it is impossible for it to find a solution. It has not said that it is impossible to find a solution. There is a distinction there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the letter from the chairman of ACAS, which has been referred to a number of times, there are a number of implications, to put it no higher—and the hon. and learned Gentleman was talking about implications a little earlier—which sit fairly well with the sort of suggestions that my hon. Friends and I have made in terms of possible solutions. On page 3 of his letter the chairman of ACAS talks particularly about the difficulties over discretion. He says:
	<br><q><p>"The Grunwick case established that the Service has a mandatory duty to ascertain the opinions of workers to whom the recognition issue relates. The statute provides for no discretion so that even where an employer or a union refuses cooperation the Service is left with a duty it cannot perform."</p></q>
That matter of discretion is something which we suggested earlier might be—we put it no higher than that—dealt with by turning to the Northern Ireland type provisions. Indeed, it might be dealt with in this sort of case by sanctions against employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my hon. Friend the Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Radice), was accused of suggesting that the employers should not be part of ACAS, he quickly put that right and no one is suggesting that it should not continue to be a tripartite body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On our own new clause I have some doubts. I understand the point made by the hon. and learned Gentleman about total exclusion of the courts and the rule of law. Nobody on the Opposition side was being dogmatic about that, but it seems that if the Government were to bring people together on this issue and they were to argue it out they might be able to tell the TUC that they had some more clearly defined criteria which might give the TUC more discretion in these cases and might include certain sanctions against employers in some situations, and that if the trade unions were prepared to accept that the question of the courts would also have to be dealt with, perhaps against that background the unions would not find recourse to the courts as a last resort quite as objectionable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1630</span>
Throughout the Bill we have argued that we want to keep industrial relations out of the courts and that is certainly my standpoint. All that I am saying is that until one gets people around the table and tries to make an effort, one does not know what will come out of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the suggestion that the Secretary of State cannot do anything about it and that the Government have to throw up their hands in despair, the answer is that they have not really tried. All that they have done is to present us with this proposition in the middle of a consultative document and a Bill which is highly contentious and, overall, is highly objectionable. If they had isolated this particular issue—and, because of the greater doubts and uncertainties on this issue than perhaps any other issue in the Bill, that would have been justifiable—perhaps we would not have been debating it. They might even by now have come up with an acceptable formula that appealed to the Secretary of State, whom my right hon. Friend has already quoted as saying that he had some sympathy with the preservation of a statutory arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One wonders why, if the Secretary of State really takes that view, he has not been able to do something about it. We know that in the end these are collective decisions. They are not made by the Secretary of State alone. Perhaps once again he has had his knuckles rapped and has had to say that he was "very sorry" for those remarks that he made on the Floor of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the right hon. Gentleman has solved the mystery for us this morning.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman is a dove that has had its wings clipped. I do not know. Whatever the situation, it is unfortunate that the Secretary of State, who expressed that view, has not seen it through, has not brought people together and has not tried to get an agreed and acceptable solution on a consensus basis. The answer is that they the Government have not really tried. They have been dogmatic. They have decided to get rid of these powers. It comes back to the fact that once again they are

	<p>or in the case of whom provision is made by or under any such enactment for the settlement of questions as to remuneration or terms and conditions or minimum remuneration or terms and conditions.</p>
	<p>4. A claim may be reported under paragraph 1 above, where, or so far as, the claim is founded upon recognised terms and conditions, by an employers' association or an independent trade union being one of the parties mentioned in paragraph 2(	<i>a</i>) above.</p>
	<p>5. A claim under paragraph I above shall be in writing and shall contain such particulars as the Service may require.</p>
	<p>6. When a claim is reported to the Service under paragraph I above the Service shall take any steps which seem to it expedient to settle the claim or to secure the use of appropriate machinery to settle the claim and shall if the claim is not otherwise settled refer it to the Committee.</p>

	<li>the employer to satisfy the Committee that he is observing terms and conditions of employment not less favourable than the recognised terms and conditions.</li></ol></p>
	<p>8. In ascertaining whether, in respect of any matter which is the subject of a claim under paragraph I above, the employer is observing terms and conditions less favourable than the recognised terms and conditions, regard shall be had to the whole of the terms and conditions observed by the employer as respects the worker to whom the claim relates.</p>
	<p>9. If the Committee finds the claim wholly or partly well-founded it shall make an award that the employer shall observe the recognised terms and conditions and shall identify or specify—

	<li>the recognised terms and conditions;</li>
	<li>the description or descriptions of employees in respect of which they are to be observed; and</li>

	<ol>
	<li>by a subsequent award under that paragraph;</li>
	<li>by a collective agreement between the employer and the trade union for the time being representing that employee; or</li>

If in the course of determining a claim under this Schedule after the commencement of section 3 of the Equal Pay Act 1970, it appears to the Committee that a collective agreement or pay structure within the meaning of that section contains any provision applying specifically to men only or to women only so that it would, had it been referred to the Committee by the Secretary of State under that section, have required amendment in accordance with subsection (4) of that section so as to remove that discrimination between men and women—
	<ol>
	<li>that provision shall not be regarded as part of the recognised terms and conditions; and</li>

	<ol>
	<li>that the union is a party to one or more collective agreements and that those agreements cover a significant number of establishments within the field of operation of that council or Board either generally or in the district in which the worker is employed; and</li>

	<li>that in those establishments the circumstances of the employer are similar to those of the employer of the worker in question; and</li>
	<li>that the employer is paying him less than the lowest current rate of remuneration (disregarding any rate agrreed to more than 12 months before the date on which the claim was reported) payable to the workers of his description under any of those agreements.</li></ol></p>

	<ol>
	<li>as if for any reference to the recognised terms and conditions there were substituted a reference to the rate of remuneration referred to in paragraph 14(c) above;</li>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In speaking to the other amendments on the clause, I described it as one of the most depressing clauses in the Bill. Once again, I repeat those words in respect of this part of the clause which again illustrates the retrograde attitude of the Government, particularly to individual workers' rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that an almost cavalier attitude has been adopted. I could say that if I did not think that it was a pretty calculated attitude as well. I find it impossible to understand on what the Government base their case for change in this aspect of the Bill, other than a further and misguided attempt to try to undermine the extension of the fruits of collective bargaining, presumably in the mistaken belief that it will look good to employers, but really as a result of a doctrinaire desire to satisfy their own backwoodsmen. I cannot see any other explanation for going up this road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the Secretary of State has to try to balance his package to satisfy as many sections of his own party as possible and I suppose that hacking away at the employment protection measures fits that bill for him. We know what has been done to attack workers' rights on unfair dismissal in the small firms sector through restricting maternity reinstatement provisions. The approach in this part of the Bill fits precisely into that pattern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultative document suggested a number of defects in this area. It was pretty prejudiced in the way that it presented the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1379">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1635</span>
case. It said that the Government would welcome views on alternative courses and offered three possiblities—the total repeal of the provisions, repeal of the general level provisions, and the amendment of the schedule. It also referred to the fair wages resolution, and there are questions to be asked about the Government's attitude to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In essence, it was a somewhat phoney consultation. The Government had apparently made up their minds in advance. If that was not so, one is forced to wonder why there was no worthwhile response to the suggestions that were made. The Government are proposing full repeal—scrapping the lot. Little evidence has been provided to justify that action. I suppose that I am repeating what I said on the previous amendment, but, if anything, the Government should be conducting a much more exhaustive and lengthy review of the whole low pay area, particularly in respect of the schedule, with a view to improving and extending it, not getting rid of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's decision is nothing short of a declaration of intent that they do not give much of a damn about the lowest-pay and poorest workers, who are also frequently the most poorly organised and the most vulnerable. Many of them will now be utterly unprotected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend referred earlier to the Chancellor's Budget Statement. As he rightly said, that too has particular implications for the low-paid. One has only to look at the fact that the increase in child benefit certainly does not match the rise in inflation to see that more and more people at the low-paid end of the scale will be hit by the Government's actions. They will be hit even harder if the clause goes through unamended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change to the existing legislation is proposed on the basis of three years' experience of the schedule. That is all—a mere three years. First, one must take the Government's arguments and ask whether the legislation has helped the low-paid. I want to quote at some length from the latest document on low pay. Some interesting and up-to-date figures have been produced. Attention is drawn to the confusion between what is meant by absolute low pay and relative low pay. It states that, by definition, pockets of low pay in particular industries must refer to relative low pay, which can exist at any level of the earnings structure. It quotes
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1636</span>
Professor Sir John Wood, the chairman of the Central Arbitration Committee:
	<br><q><p>"Schedule 11 is about comparisons on an industry basis and at district level. Low pay in these circumstances must mean comparatively low pay."</p></q>
I think that that makes sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report goes on to refer to the University of Warwick industrial relations research unit, whose findings we have already used extensivley in the Committee They have been valuable. The' Central Arbitration Committee points to the fact that it has recently completed an analysis of claims under schedule 11 for the three years 1977–79 inclusive. These results have not yet been published, but they have been made available to the Low Pay Unit, and the unit in turn has produced this grouping so that the Committee may have the benefit of the information.

It is a valuable piece of analysis. There is a table which I imagine Committee members will have seen. I shall not go into too much detail, therefore. The analysis suggests that in 1979, when even an absolute definition of low pay would have stood at £60 a week, the median earnings of manual claimants under the recognised terms and conditions provisions were £52.80 a week, and for those under the general terms £56.90 a week. In the case of non-manual claimants, median earnings were £103.90 under the recognised terms and conditions, and £80.50 under the general provision, compared with the median for all employees of £90.46 a week. The Warwick university unit points out that the earnings of non-manual claimants under the recognised terms were slightly higher than the overall average, which was due largely to claims by higher grade local authority staff.

The unit researchers say that the results for 1977 and 1979 confirm the conclusion drawn from a similar analysis for 1978 that schedule 11 does—and I stress the word "does"—appear to be fulfilling one of its objectives, namely, that of helping to remove pockets of low pay. A complete re-drafting and, even abolition of schedule 11 would, they say, do little to improve the condition of the lower paid. In fact, it could exclude significant numbers of employees from the only statutory protection in this area available to them. That was the point I made earlier.

I have more detail about these results, and perhaps if we need to do so, I can return to the topic later. Suffice to say that the conclusions of the Low Pay Unit on this evidence is simply that this previously unavailable evidence does, therefore, support the case that schedule 11 had helped the low paid. The Government's decision to abolish the schedule would therefore suggest a lack of commitment towards this group. On the Opposition side of the Committee, I think the comment is "So say all of us."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another reason the Government have given for seeking to get rid of this piece of legislation is that it is being used to circumvent the pay policy. That is a strange argument in present circumstances. But schedule 11 quite specifically excluded those claims from the then Government's pay policy at that time—and yes, it was, so to speak, tantamount to an invitation to people to use schedule II in that way. But I suggest that it has been generally recognised that it acted as a considerable safety valve in the conditions existing. To that extent—and no one should ever pretend that pay policies have any perfection about them—it may have assisted in an indirect fashion in sustaining pay policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is certainly a case for getting rid of it, but perhaps it is actually a case for saying that incomes policies, when we have them, need to make proper provisions for anomalies, special cases, and so on. That takes us back to an era that even some of my hon. Friends would prefer to forget. I do not prefer to forget that time. That was the era when we had a prices and incomes board, and those sort of provisions did exist. I think that that was helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I certainly do not see how this Government can justify abolishing the provisions on the grounds that they get around the pay policy. We do not have a pay policy, so why should that be cited as a reason? The Government will not have a pay policy. The Prime Minister made it clear that the Government will not have a pay policy, Only just before the Budget speech, the Secretary of State for Industry was quoted as saying that it would be unthinkable for the Government to have a pay policy. He also said it would be unthinkable for the trade unions to have a pay policy. We shall have to see about that. I suspect that when they have had a further belly full of what this Government are doing in regard to pay and industrial relations, they may have second thoughts. Certainly the Govern-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1638</span>
ment have firmly ruled it out, yet at the very time when they are ruling it out they are using this as an excuse for getting rid of this piece of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know where the Secretary of State stands these days on pay policy. I think he recently made remarks to the effect that the best way was for people to impose their own pay policy, or a piece of old flannel of that kind. My own view is that, as a former supporter of a more structured incomes policy, he has sold out. I suppose he cannot be expected to fight on all fronts at once. Since there is no pay policy now, I should have thought that schedule 11 could be given a real run. This is just the time to use it, when there is no pay policy; give it a real test and see the full extent to which it can help tackle the very grave problem of low pay because—let us not hide the fact—the previous Government did not resolve the problem of low pay. We did quite a lot towards assisting the low paid, but we certainly did not resolve the problem. It may be a case of saying that the poor are always with us. Certainly the Government have an opportunity here, in the absence of a pay policy, to tackle that problem of low pay which, as we all know, is accentuated by the undercutting of wages. That has been a major task of the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third reason given by the Government for repealing schedule 11 is the whole question of industrial relations. The Government have admitted that it has helped in some cases—a rather grudging admission—to prevent industrial conflict, which takes me back to my earlier point about safety valves. They then talk about it undermining pay structures and established collective bargaining arrangements, about upsetting relativities, that it does not allow for consideration of market prospects, profit, labour efficiency, prices—one might almost expect to see the now time-honoured phrase "size and administrative resources" built in somewhere. The answer to that is probably given in the Warwick survey, and I am now going back to the earlier survey which we touched on in our previous discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The IRRU carried out a fairly extensive survey, as the Committee knows. It found no evidence from managers or trade unionists
	<br><q><p>"to suggest that collective bargaining was being hindered or in any, way restricted as a result of employers being subject to this form of arbitration. Moreover, since the provisions were first introduced in January 1977, some 75 per cent. of all
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1381">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1639</span>
employers involved in Schedule 11 claims made only one appearance before the committee"—</p></q>
that is, the Central Arbitration Committee—
	<br><q><p>"and on the basis of this evidence of exceptional rather than extensive use of unilateral arbitration under schedule 11, it is doubtful that the development by agreement of sound procedures for the resolution of pay and other issues is being harmed. Rather, the findings of the survey suggest that it was far more common for managers in particular to complain of the restrictions that incomes policy placed on bargaining"—</p></q>
and of course we are all familiar with that type of complaint, but it was not schedule 11 that was worrying them. The report adds that the Government argue
	<br><q><p>"that the defects in the criteria for assessing schedule 11 claims would be remedied if these were extended to include some of the economic consideratons"—</p></q>
and I have just referred to those. The report goes on:
	<br><q><p>"However, it is apparent that the committee"—</p></q>
again, it is the Central Arbitration Com-mittee—
	<br><q><p>"already consider market forces, where appropriate, when deciding on a union claim. Under the general level the CAC must decide, on the basis of the terms and conditions which apply to comparable workers and comparable employers in the same trade or industry who are in the same district. Thus in practice the committee will generally rule out any comparisons between public and private sector enterprises, even when they operate in the same industry—for example, civil aviation and banking—precisely because different economic imperatives are at work. Moreover, in deciding which trade or industry an employer is engaged in, the CAC have stressed that while employees' jobs must be comparable, so too must the nature of the employer's business be corn-parable with other employers in the same trade or industry in the same district. Indeed, on occasions the committee have detected very fine distinctions in an industry which has favoured the employers' defects. As to defining 'the district', the CAC has stated that the term is plainly restricted, and it is clear to us that its purpose is to prevent comparisons being made over the boundaries of wage and salary disputes. Consequently the committee considers a number of local labour market factors, such as the locality, where the employer recruits workers of the type covered by the claim, the area in which most of the workers reside and travel to work, and the area coverd by other employers with whom the company competes for the type of-labour covered by the records. Nor indeed does the committee spurn the criterion of profitability. In deciding claims, the CAC takes into account the pay and other conditions of employment prevailing in companies in comparable economic situations. These form the range within which the general level is determined to the extent that these companies consider'their ability to pay and levels of profitability. When settling rates of pay, CAC awards do reflect, albeit indirectly, these economic criteria."</p></q>
I apologise for quoting that at length, but
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1640</span>
it is important to put it on record because it destroys another sizeable chunk of the Government's argument. Unless the hon. and learned Gentleman comes forward with some unexpected evidence which we have not seen, there is no evidence of adverse effect on pay structures that he will be able to cite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence, as I have just quoted, is that the schedule, if anything, has helped industrial relations and has helped to correct anomalies. That has been borne out by the Warwick survey in a number of places, and I can again quote at length, if necessary. But there is no doubt that it has been helpful in correcting anomalies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I add to the Warwick view one or two views expressed in other quarters. A number of individual unions have expressed the view—and it is fair to say that the TUC generally shares it—that unions are more likely to resort to industrial action if schedule 11 is not available to them. That was certainly the case when the Industrial Disputes Order 1951 was scrapped in 1959.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a strong union feeling that, even where the provision has not been used, it has helped in the development of collective bargaining. The prospect of its use has brought employers to the bargaining table, and it has often been a substitute for strikes. It has helped preserve industrial peace. It is important to bear that in mind when there is talk of tearing it up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly most of the major employers' organisations are against total repeal. If the Government will not listen to the views of the trade unions, they ought, in matters of this kind, to give some weight to the views of major employers' organisations. The Engineering Employers' Federation has deplored the abolition of the recognised terms and conditions provision. It is true that it wants the general level provision dropped, but it has said that the repeal of the whole lot would undermine collective bargaining. There is no doubt that it shares the view of the trade unions on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British Institute of Management would like to see the general level provision go. It polled its membership. The CBI, it seems, has a divided membership. Its members cannot make up their minds on this issue. But they are certainly not prepared to support the Government's policy, as I understand it, of full-scale repeal.
