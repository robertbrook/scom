	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Reginald Eyre)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned on Thursday I was replying to points made by the right hon. and learned Member for Warley, West (Mr. Archer) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) on the problems raised for practitioners by defining terms used in our present Bill by reference to definitions contained in previous Acts. The definitions referred to are of "accounting reference period", "conditional sale agreement" and "hire-purchase agreement". I was saying that much of this will be put right on consolidation, and I know that that will please my right hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said at our last sitting, the matter will be improved after we have consolidated, because the relevant part of, for example, the 1976 Act will be readily to hand in the same Act as the provisions of the Bill. This will not be the case for the two definitions which refer to the Consumer Credit Act, but I assure hon. Members that there are good reasons for making this reference instead of spelling out the definitions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recognising the obvious difficulty of discussing these definitions in Committee without having the definitions laid down in the Bill, I attempted to assist hon. Members by reading out the definitions of "conditional sale agreement" and "hire purchase agreement" taken from the Consumer Credit Act 1974. I refer the Committee to col. 339 of the 	<i>Official Report</i> of the debate on Thursday, and I assure hon. Members that I shall assist them in the same way if the need arises in discussion on the new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>354</span>
The right hon. and learned Member for Warley, West asked whether there was any necessity to make these cross-references. I assure him that they do not owe their existence to any deliberate attempt by the draftsmen to add obscurity to company law. To repeat these lengthy definitions—they are lengthy—would unnecessarily encumber the Bill and, more important, could be misleading in so far as it might suggest that new definitions are being added which change accepted definitions already enshrined in law, to which people are accustomed to refer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, the definition of terms by reference to existing interpretations makes clear that we are not attempting to introduce new terms or new interpretations. I therefore hope that hon. Gentlemen will be patient with these cross-references and accept that there is good reason for this method of drafting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 247, in page 65, line 37, leave out subsection (5).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5) was inserted in another place because it is a privilege of this House to control charges on public funds. To avoid infringing this privilege, it was necessary for their Lordships to insert the subsection while the Bill was under discussion in another place. The Bill will, of course, have financial implications. As is stated on page vi of the memorandum, initially a net increase of about nine staff will be needed to administer the provisions of the Bill, at a cost of about £47,000 a year, falling after two years to about five staff at a cost of about £25,000 a year. We therefore need to delete the subsection, and that is the effect of this privilege amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>355</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to refer to clause 59(1) and to inquire why the Bill has not been entitled the "Companies and Reform of Registration of Business Names Act". I must press the Government a little further on their attitude with regard to the register of business names. They will know that the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies has expressed considerable reservations about the options which the Government are currently pursuing in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is not only anxiety on the part of the users of the registry. There is also anxiety on the part of employees at the registry about what sort of future lies ahead for them. The Government must make up their mind on the matter with some urgency. I know what we can expect from the Under-Secretary this morning—that the Government are still giving it their consideration and all the rest of the phrases that he has trotted out in the past few months. But that is not good enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would be saved by such an exercise? Perhaps the Minister will give us some particulars. What benefits would accrue to the community at large if the registry were to disappear? More important, what disadvantages would flow from that? Surely, the Minister can give us that information without prejudice to his conclusions, although I beg him to hurry up about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the view that manifestly the matter could be cleared up with considerable speed. The business names registry is said to have been in the red to the extent of about £500,000 during the past year. That could be dealt with instantly if the Government were either to introduce—they would have our full support—a new Bill or were to graft on to this Bill a provision to increase the fees of the business names registry so as to give them some sort of realistic basis. It is palpably absurd that those fees should still be regulated by 1916 standards, and it is no wonder that the registry is faced with a deficit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, if the Government are concerned to phase out the jobs of a number of civil servants, let them think of the damage that would be done to small business generally if that option were to become policy. I urge the Minister to be a little more forthcoming about the issue than he has been in the past, to particularise the pros and cons of the arguments that he is currently considering, and not to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>356</span>
push out the usual trite stuff that lie and his colleagues have been giving us during the past few months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter goes beyond the interests of only one side of the Committee or the House. I know that there is considerable anxiety on the Government side. Perhaps today will give the Under-Secretary the opportunity to clear up some of the mist that surrounds the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) said, the future of the register of business names is under consideration. While we shall carefully consider all the points that he has made, we shall not come to a decision immediately. However, consideration is going on and we shall come to that decision quite soon. An announcement will be made. The decision will be made without delay, but after due consideration of all the points that have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Bill is not named the "Companies and Registration of Business Names Bill", as the hon. Gentleman pointed out. It would not therefore be proper for me to reply in detail to the points that he raised, since they do not come within the scope of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Bill were named as I have suggested, the matter would come within its scope. We are discussing clause stand part and, in particular, how the Act may be cited. I merely ask the hon. Gentleman to be more forthcoming, to tell us the pros and cons of the argument that he is considering, and tell us why the registry of business names cannot even now be brought within the compass of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It certainly is not within the compass of the Bill at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only repeat that the points raised by the hon. Gentleman do not come within the scope of the Bill and I regret that I cannot add to what I have said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Stevens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order Sir Stephen. On new clause 20, amendment (	<i>a</i>) which should be in my name has appeared in the name of my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House of Commons.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was corrected before the Committee sat this morning. It has been done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Arising out of that, Sir Stephen, may I say that immediately I saw it on the Paper I thought it astonishing that the Leader of the House should have interfered in his Government's Bill, but I immediately accepted his credentials so to do and added my name to ensure that the matter would be discussed. I do not consider that the hon. Gentleman's creden-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>358</span>
tials are any less worthy than those of the Leader of the House, but I am now reconsidering my position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say at the outset that I am pleased to be back from overseas in time to take part in this debate, which I consider to be one of the most interesting in this Committee stage. I live in hope that as a result of our work here we shall finally dispose of a problem with which successive Governments have tried to deal since 1973. Successive Committees in successive Parliaments have found themselves in the position of the young man stranded in a harem knowing exactly what he wanted to do but not quite sure where to start. On this occasion, we know what we want to do and how we want to start, and I believe that we have found an acceptable answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 20 places a duty on directors to have regard in the performance of their functions to the interests of the company's employees. Hon. Members will recall that in clause 46 we have reversed the judgment in Parke v. 	<i>Daily News</i> that a company is acting	<i>ultra vires</i> if it makes provision for employees on cessation or transfer of business. I think we would all agree that it was that incident that started the train of thought and the discussion about how employees' interests could be better protected and better defined in company law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was not only that specific point about making provision for employees on the cessation or transfer of business that came up during the case of Parke v. 	<i>Daily News.</i> It was put to the court during that case that, while the prime duty of directors should be to the shareholders,
	<br><blockquote><p>"boards of directors must take into consideration their duty to employees in these days".</p></blockquote>
on which the judge expressed himself as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No authority to support that proposition as a proposition of law was cited to me; I know of none, and in my judgment such is not the law".</p></blockquote>
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been clear for some time that this state of affairs is unsatisfactory, and, as I hinted earlier, various attempts have been made to bring the law into line with the consideration that many directors do in fact give to the interests of the company's employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say at the outset that I have never accepted what I may call the conflict theory which seemed to dominate a lot of our discussions in the last Committee stage,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0199">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>359</span>
that in well run companies boards of directors seek constantly to further the interests of the shareholders at the expense of the employees. From my own experience of business, I knew that that simply was not the case. In fact, in well run companies boards of directors actually further the interests of their shareholders by making sure that the interests of their employees are properly taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we are not talking about introducing into the commercial world a practice which is totally unknown. We are talking about reminding what I believe to be a minority of companies and boards of directors of what is now the practice in most well run companies. I stress that in my own business we saw the interests of employees and shareholders as running together, we worked to promote both, and as a result both groups were better off. I wish to make clear at the outset that we are not introducing some great innovation into business practice and that most well run businesses conform to the principles that we try to enunciate in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As long ago as 1973, the Conservative Government introduced their Companies Bill, at which time I was Parliamentary Private Secretary to my right hon. Friend the present Secretary of State for the Environment, so I had the privilege of sitting silent on that Committee six years ago. I sat in Committee during the 24 sittings on the Bill in 1976. Therefore, Sir Stephen, you can well imagine that I have a personal interest in wanting to see the clause enacted to do what was identified six years ago as being necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour Government in their 1976 Bill started by providing that directors should, in the performance of their functions, have regard to the interests of employees, and then went on to suggest that the duty should be owed to and in some sense be enforceable by the employees. Since then, the Opposition appear to have modified their line somewhat, and I shall show in a few minutes why we consider that their intention in new clause 13 would in fact be better expressed by our new clause 20. I do not believe that there is a great deal of difference between the two sides of the Committee in our ambitions, and I hope that by the time I finish my remarks the Opposition will feel that our new clause perhaps does their job for them rather better than their new clause 13.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposal, however, has its origins
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>360</span>
in the statement that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made before we took office, when he wrote a letter, jointly with the Secretary of State for Employment, to Conservative Trade Unionists in May 1978, saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Company law should be amended to reflect existing practice in industry which is that, in furthering the interests of the company, the board of directors should have particular regard to employees as well as to shareholders".</p></blockquote>
We on the Government side therefore wish to see company law state quite unambiguously that directors have a duty—that is, a mandatory and not a permissive requirement—to consider the interests of employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We start from the proposition that the directors' duty to the company is to carry out their functions in what they consider to be the interests of the company as a whole. Subsection (1) of new clause 20 does not seek to change this and therefore means that the directors, as a matter of obligation, shall continue to have regard to the interests of shareholders, present and future, in the course of carrying out their functions. It then goes on to specify that consideration of the interests of the company's employees in general, that is, taken as a whole, shall fall to be included as a factor in determining the performance of those functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is almost a truism that the status of the body of shareholders and of the body of employees is different. The new clause recognises the interests of both. It does not give the directors a reason for preferring the interests of the employees at the expense of members, which is the risk that certain forms of permissive entitlement might carry. The reference to the interests of members is therefore intended to clarify that the duty to have regard to the interests of employees will fall to be resolved within the existing duty of directors to the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, we are saying that the directors' duty to the company is defined. It is to the company. In the performance of that duty they should, as a matter of requirement, have regard to the interests of employees. But it is not a double duty. It is a clearer definition of their existing duty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that the employees have no method of enforcing the duty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the right
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0200">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>361</span>
hon. and learned Gentleman will allow me to go through the whole of my argument. As he will realise, it is closely knit. We do not work to a script, but I want my words to be clearly on the record. Therefore, I have worked the argument out in a way which I hope will satisfy the right hon. and learned Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) states that the duty to consider the interests of the employees is enforceable in the same manner as is any fiduciary duty, that is, by the company, and this right of enforcement flows directly from the way in which the duty to employees is expressed in subsection (1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of enforceability by the company is also underlined by the word "accordingly" at the beginning of subsection (2) and by the emphasis on "the company alone" in the parenthesis. We see no reason to give employees a right of action against directors for a breach of this duty as this would put the employees in a preferred position as compared with the shareholders, whose right of redress lies with the company—apart, that is, from the exceptions to the rule in Foss v. Harbottle, and the unfair prejudice provisions under clause 47 of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to see that we are in agreement on the present position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seemed to be looking in my direction. I wonder whether he was inviting me to intervene again. He has pointed out that there are certain exceptions to the rule limiting the ability of shareholders to enforce their rights. Are there any equivalent exceptions in the case of employees?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are certain statutory rights already embodied in a range of statutes which give the employees in a number of cases a right to take action against the directors which is not open to the shareholders I am thinking, for instance, of the Redundancy Payments Act, the Employment Protection Act and other measures under which the employees have a specific right to take action against the directors in specific instances. Therefore, there is a parallel. The employees will indeed have specific rights not available to the shareholders which they can use against the directors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are not available to some shareholders. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>362</span>
Minister will recognise that some directors are both shareholders and employees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and that is a double argument. An employee who is a shareholder will have, in addition to his statutory rights as an employee, his rights in the special instances that I have already mentioned. There are specific rights reserved for members and there are specific rights reserved for employees. But the directors' duty is to the company as a whole.

The Government's policy is to emphasise that a company's best interests can properly be served if the directors, in addition to the other factors they consider, take into account the interests of the company's employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although such consideration will not imply any uncritical acceptance by directors of employees' demands, it will mean that the contribution that both employees and members make to the success of each enterprise will now be recognised in company law. It will therefore remove any legal impediment that directors might have felt themselves facing in taking employee involvement seriously and, as such, provide a general encouragement to companies to devise, in ways appropriate to their own circumstances, means of ensuring that the interests of employees are adequately covered. We are therefore seeking to extend what responsible boards already do by laying down in this new clause what we hope is an authoritative indicator of good practice. I stress here the points that I made in my opening remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A comparison of the Opposition's proposal with ours shows that they, too, do not intend to subordinate the duty of directors to act in the best interests of the company to the separate duty that they propose to put directors under to have regard to the interests of employees. But, unlike our proposal, they go on to make that separate duty one owed by the directors to the employees and therefore, in theory, enforceable by them. Yet in legal terms this obligation does not reduce the directors' fiduciary duty which therefore remains the directors' prime duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, subsection (2) of new clause 13 shows that the main intention of subsection (1) is to provide a defence for directors, when acting in regard to employees' interests, against actions brought against them by shareholders. Our pro-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0201">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>363</span>
posal would remove the need for such a defence, by incorporating the duty to have regard to employees' interests in the duty to act in the best interests of the company, and will do so without running the same risk of vexatious, even if ultimately unsuccessful, litigation that we believe the Opposition's new clause would be likely to generate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the crucial point. The Opposition's approach is ambivalent in that it sets up two conflicting duties and therefore has to provide a means of resolving them, in the form of a defence for directors. Our proposal, on the other hand, makes clear where the duty to employees lies, namely, that it is part of the duty of directors to act in the best interests of the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that in another place Lord Elwyn-Jones said that the Opposition's proposal was intended to be "protective of adventurous litigation". I always envy lawyers their capacity for coining beautiful phrases. It is a gift that is not given to accountants. We just plug away with figures. But that is an attractive phrase. I think that Lord Elwyn-Jones was saying that the Opposition share with the Government the ambition not to give rise to a flood of vexatious unnecessary litigation which could delay decisions, damage the commercial interests of companies, and do employees no good at all. I believe that we are both agreed in wishing to avoid a flood of that type of litigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our view, our proposal provides effective protection, whereas there is no guarantee that the Opposition's clause would do so. It could lead to the commencement of proceedings, and thus to the unnecessary harassment of management, and to problems of industrial efficiency and labour relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore believe that our proposal gives long overdue statutory expression to the principle that in the proper performance of their functions directors should consider the interests of the company's employees, and it does so in a way that is consistent with the existing manner of enforcing the directors' fiduciary duties to the company. Our provision will, therefore, in preserving the primacy of the duty to act in the interests of the company, ensure that in future directors will be required to take a broader view of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>364</span>
interests of the company. I invite its acceptance by the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Certainly, the provision that he puts forward provides no final solution to a difficult problem. I wish to make that quite clear on behalf of the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I agree with the Minister when he says that this debate is one of the most important that we shall have in the Committee. In a sense, it determines the view that we take about the role of the law. on the whole subject. Is it, as we think it should be, regarded as an instrument of change, or should it be seen as a sort of desiccated and rather useless instrument that increasingly insulates itself from the real needs of society in the technological revolution through which we are passing and which will gain in intensity in the 1980s?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our new clause 13 is, I believe, a basic prerequisite to any movement in the direction of industrial democracy. We believe that a supervisory board with teeth should be established, and that employees should be represented on it. That was the view of the last Government and is the view of the present Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that there are different points of view both within and outside the Labour movement on this subject. There are those who argue that it is not the role of employees to become involved in management decisions and that the status quo, with all its difficulties and dangers, should be preserved. I do not share that view, and I believe that it would be in the best interest of British industry if the adversary relationship—which, to a degree and certainly in respect of collective bargaining, is important were nevertheless qualified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I have always strongly been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0202">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>365</span>
in favour of a movement towards industrial democracy along the lines that I have briefly sketched, without rehearsing all the arguments this morning. I still believe that that is a much better prescription than the sort of conflict which besets British industry all too often as a result of unwise management decisions, which in their train sometimes produce unwise trade union decisions. If there is a situation of conflict and one believes that it should be perpetuated—or at least one does nothing about it—that is the price which must be paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to observe the view of Philips Electrical Limited, a view cited by one of my hon. Friends during in Committee on the Labour Government's Bill when this issue was debated. I know that this is the view of Philips Electrical, because I have been to one of the company's presentations—and no one can doubt that that is a highly prestigious and progressive-thinking company. That company's view is that unless the law on the responsibility of directors towards employees is changed there can be no real expansion of co-partnership or co-determination. That view has not simply been worked out in theory but is a view arrived at following many years of practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that view presupposes that the legal change we are seeking to enact is meaningful. It is not good enough simply to pay lip service to the concept, which I believe to be the result of the Government's thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our complaint against the Government's new clause is that that is all it does, and everything that the Minister for Trade, said this morning reinforces that view. Of course, there has been a slight change of heart from previous Conservative efforts in this respect. In 1973, as the hon. Gentleman said, we had a wholly permissive approach to the subject. We objected to that. The Labour Government's Bill in 1976 sought, as the Opposition do now, to impose a mandatory requirement on directors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our further objection to new clause 20 is that it puts shareholders and employees on a completely different footing. It perpetuates the inadequacies of existing law. There is no suggestion of even-handedness. I believe this to be an archaic approach, as I have already indicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman admitted, in answer to my right hon. and learned Friend, that shareholders as a body have a remedy to ensure that directors fulfil
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>366</span>
their obligations in having regard to shareholders' interests. He argues that he is not paying mere lip service to an airy principle, but there is no such qualification of rights imported into the Bill vis-a-vis shareholders as is contained in subsection (2) of new clause 20. Indeed, we have been at pains on both sides of the Committee to reinforce the rights of minority shareholders who require protection against the aberrant behaviour of certain directors. But from the debates about Foss v. Harbottle I am beginning to doubt which side the Minister is on—is he a Foss man or a Harbottle man?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A Government man.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the trouble. He would be better off being a Foss or a Harbottle man than a Government man. That is clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But what a contrast there is in the Government's attitude on employees. They are extremely concerned—as they should be, and as we are, too—about the rights of minority shareholders who find that the directors are abusing their position. We have been very concerned to ensure that the protection that was available under section 210 of the 1948 Act is now substantially reinforced. But what is the new clause about? It is a declaration of good intent—neither more nor less than that. No sanction is provided, and none can be provided, according to the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who would expect the company to take action to enforce the obligation set out in subsection (1) of new clause 20? Why should directors fulfil that duty, unless, as many directors are, they are guided by prudence, the goodness of their hearts, and running the business sensibly? But not all directors are like that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State takes a simplistic view of this. He is on record as saying that all directors are motivated by those magnificient sentiments. If that were so, why bother to give protection to minorities as they have been given under section 210 and the present proposals of the Government which the Committee has now endorsed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If all directors took that benevolent view of their duties there would be no need for that protection. The truth is that when we are dealing with legislation we are really dealing with the laggards in industry, the people who are not prepared to exercise the sort of prudence that the Minister
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0203">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>367</span>
expects of them. Indeed, much of the law is about making provision to deal with that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are concerned lest individual workers would burden the courts with a vast panoply of litigation by seeking a remedy if our provision were to be enacted. I believe that to be wholly fanciful. One has only to look at the inadequacies of the present legal aid system to recognise how difficult it is for a man or woman of modest means to embark upon almost any litigation in these days. Perhaps when that matter is resolved—in five or 10 years, I suppose—the strength of people to go to the courts to seek redress will be assisted. But even in a world where legal aid did not contain those inadequacies, the suggestion that there would be a flood of litigation of this sort is, I repeat, completely fanciful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, there is a reluctance on the part of many trade unions and employees to go to law because they do not see that as the best way of strengthening collective bargaining, and I do not believe that it would become a prominent feature of litigation in the courts. The fact is that not all workers are members of trade unions or enjoy the benefits of the best collective bargaining arrangements, and there is, in our view, no reason why the workers should be treated on a wholly different basis from the shareholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The asset stripper who moves into a company would claim that he performs his task to assist the shareholders, but very often this is to the complete detriment of the whole of the work force. I would wish to see a man or woman who has given a lifetime of service to a factory or an industry be given at least the same sort of rights as that asset stripper. That is a fundamental entitlement from which the Government seek to run away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our new clause 13 is a paving proposal for any significant move towards industrial democracy and in itself is not a particularly radical proposal. While it certainly affects the balance of power in industry—the balance of duties and responsibilities of directors—I do not think that anybody will build enormous expectations upon it. Nevertheless, it is important for the reasons I have already stressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that although company law is an integral part of a decisive move towards industrial democracy—it is essential that the too many laggards in British
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>368</span>
industry should be compelled to comply with certain basic requirements of the law—it is not the prime way in which the changes that we seek will be accomplished. So while the purpose of our new clause 13 is not tremendously radical in altering the position of employees of companies or their relationship with employers, it clarifies the legal duties of a director in relation to his company's employees. It imposes a positive duty to take account of the employees' interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To succeed in a claim whereby the directors' actions are challenged, a plaintiff will have to establish that the directors have not taken the interests of employees into account at all and that the decision was such that no reasonable board could have reached it if it had considesed those interests. So the burden of proof on the plaintiff is heavy. But it would catch the blatant cases that were described by my right hon. and hon. Friends in debates on the Labour Government's Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our new clause 13 also establishes certain principles that I consider very important. First, the duty to have regard to the interests of employees generally is a duty that is owed to the employees and not to the company. We depart entirely from the Government on the proposition advanced by the Minister earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, the duty is additional to, and quite separate from, the duty owed to the company. Third, it is a duty that is enforceable by the employees. Subsection (2) provides the defence—to which the hon. Gentleman referred earlier—to the director of in cases where he may be assailed by a shareholder for having paid regard to the interests of employees perhaps to a greater extent than he applied his mind to shareholders' interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be a fundamental divide between us on this issue. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman is being fanciful—I used that word earlier in another connection—in this respect also if he believes that he has solved the problem with his present form of words, because that is all it is—a meaningless form of words. There is nothing for the employees that will improve their legal rights. I concede that it gives a protection—perhaps I have been too hardsh on the hon. Gentleman—to the director who carries out those duties against assault from other shareholders. More than that it does not do. It is a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0204">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>369</span>
totally unsatisfactory way of proceeding in these matters in the 1980s, and I feel that, if the hon. Gentleman is satisfied with it, he will be satisfied with anything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In common with the Minister we feel that this is a most important matter, and I conclude my comments thus. I hope that his decision today is not hard and fast and that he will recognise that in this most important argument there is another point of view which regards his present approach with considerable dissatisfaction. I hope that he will say to the Committee "I am not totally convinced that we are wrong, but we shall reflect further." After all, that would not be unprecedented in the progress of this Bill. The hon. Gentleman has given much thought to amending the Bill, so that we now have a totally different Bill from that which originally faced us, and the excuses that he gave have not, in our view, given proper justification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, be that as it may, I ask the hon. Gentleman to say " My mind is not fully made up and I would like to think about this between now and Report." We hope that Report will be considerably delayed because there is so much to do between the end of this Committee, shortly before Christmas, and that Stage. There is much consultation to be undertaken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to know whether the Minister has taken the trouble to consult the trade union movement on this subject. If he has not, which I suspect, he ought to avail himself of that opportunity before making up his mind. I do not believe that the hon. Gentleman rejoices in the conflict theory of government. Some of his colleagues certainly do, but that is not true of either Minister on the Front Bench today. Therefore, I invite them to confer with the trade union movement, and with the TUC in particular, to see whether some improvement can be achieved, even if they do not like our particular form of words. We vehemently oppose the Government's present proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>370</span>
that I am chairman of a company which produces public company annual reports and reports for employees. However, if the distribution of annual reports were to be extended it would be of benefit to a printer—which I am not—and the opposite of a benefit to me. Nevertheless, the fact that I have been engaged in this work has given me over the years the opportunity of talking to hundreds of people working within companies, on the factory floor and elsewhere, and has given me a perspective that may not be shared by all members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, both this and the previous Government have had difficulty in reconciling the desire, that is common to both sides of the argument, to give greater recognition to the rights of employees with the sheer legal complexity of seeking to give equal rights to shareholders and employees, which in many instances simply is not possible. I support new clause 20 not because I think that it is perfect, or that it will solve for all time, the problems of industrial relations, but because I think that it represents a step forward in industrial relationships and certainly brings into legality the desire of the great majority of good company directors to care for their employees' welfare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) took his argument almost to the point of 	<i>absurdum</i> when he contrasted the typical asset stripper with the worthy artisan who has given his whole life to a company. No doubt such cases exist, but they reflect a tiny minority of the circumstances which we are discussing. I prefer to settle for a reasonable step forward giving the employee a greater sense of belonging and of status without providing an opportunity, if not for the adventurous litigant whom we heard about earlier, at least for those who, far from having given their life to a company, move into it on Monday and start causing trouble on Tuesday—a phenomenon not wholly unknown in the business world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point, if I may edge toward it without putting myself out of order, is that the distribution of reports to employees costs almost nothing. Whether a company produces an annual report typewritten on a single sheet of paper or 150,000 annual reports in five colours—as some of the greater international companies do—the ratio of the cost of running off enough to give each employee a copy is negligible in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0205">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>371</span>
relation to the cost of producing the original report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By giving each employee a copy of the report, as happens with shareholders, we would be emphasising that under the Bill the status of employees has changed perceptibly for the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems of my hon. Friend's proposal is that if it is implemented those of us whose business it is to consider these matters may see that theoretically a shift of emphasis or a change of responsibility has taken place, but for the man or woman on the shop floor no change will have taken place, and the new position will be no different from the old. But if employees get a personal copy of the annual report, they will at least realise, albeit in a small way, that Parliament has recognised a new situation and a new dimension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I attach importance to the report being delivered directly to the individual, because there is all the difference in the world between getting one's own report delivered into one's hand or posted to one's home, and having a pile of reports in the corner of the canteen and being casually told "Help yourself to one if you so desire". In the latter case the personal statutory right, in one's position as the recipient of an act of grace by the management, is greatly diminished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, without putting companies to any extra trouble or significant expense, one would be saying that the work force will be seeing the annual report and, inevitably, over a period of years, directors would in the ordinary course of events be compelled to ensure that those reports became more readily understood by the work force and contained information that employees wanted to know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Committee to recognise, therefore, that we are aiming not at perfection, but at a recognisable step forward. In supporting my hon. Friend's proposition, I ask him to consider the hint that the rules of order have permitted me to introduce into my remarks. I believe that that would give a recognisable and perceptible touch of realism to what might otherwise seem to the work force, from today's proceedings, to be somewhat esoteric.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

From my experience as a national trade union official in the engineering industry, which means contact with a considerable number of companies, I find that there is grave dissatisfaction, particularly on the shop floor, about the lack of information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All employees need to know—and have the right to know—the full facts about the company for which they work. One reason, of course, is that they have a far greater investment in the company than do shareholders, or any individual shareholder. Their livelihood and future is invested in the company. Some employees have been working for 40 or 50 years for a company, as opposed to someone who has only recently purchased shares and may well sell them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employees have a continuing interest in the well-being and progress of their company. It is an elementary democratic right that the employees should have the information that they require.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Massive changes and far-reaching decisions are often made, over the heads of employees, which lead to considerable disruption of their lives. Those decisions by managements or boards of directors sometimes lead to strikes and other disruptions in production by employees who believe that they are being unfairly treated or cheated by the company. Such a position exists at British Leyland at present, although I shall not go into that dispute. Much of the conflict there could be avoided if the necessary information, consultation and involvement of the company's employees existed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

In other EEC countries, companies are required to give employees information and to permit them to take part in decisions about how the company is conducted. My experience in Britain is similar to what occurred when, for example, we met the managing director and managers of various divisions of Ford Electrics. In order to inform us about what was going on inside the company, they called together trade union officials, including myself, to provide us with that information, which was mainly verbal, and which they said was confidential. Of course, that was pretty useless, because as the representatives of workers we wanted information that could be passed back to the employees so that they could have as many facts as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0206">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>373</span>
we had. That is what companies and the new clause call:
	<br><blockquote><p>"having regard to the interests of employees".</p></blockquote>
My union, the AUEW, is not in favour of worker directors on boards of private companies. The AUEW voices that opinion inside the trade union movement where the matter is still being discussed. But in spite of that view, we insist that all employees must have the right to all the information about their companies. Their trade union representatives should also have the right to meet the board in order to give their views on the conduct of the company, based on the information given to them by the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to see in the Green Paper under "Company Reports to Employees" that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government considers that all companies should provide their employees with information about the financial position of the company."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Many companies are making special efforts to communicate financial and other information to their employees",</p></blockquote>
If that is so—if it is an open door—why is that fact not conceded in law and included in the Bill?

The Government have put a great strain on us by tabling no fewer than 18 new clauses towards the end of the Committee stage without any explanation of those new clauses other than their titles. If they had been included in the Bill, at least there would have been a sentence about them in the explanatory memorandum.

As far as I know, there has been no consulation document and no explanation of the new clauses. My hon. Friend and his advisers may have thought it unnecessary.

Members behind him who
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>374</span>

However, I have a great deal of sympathy with the point that the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) is making. Perhaps even at this late stage he might prevail upon his ministerial colleagues to present to all members of the Committee some explanatory memoranda about the remaining new clauses. That is frequently done. I used to do it a great deal. When I was a Minister, I used to furnish the Opposition and my own side with notes relating to clauses.

Friend. I know the difficulty and detail involved in conducting a Bill through Committee. I am grateful to him for saying that we shall be given that help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the new clauses under discussion. I will deal with my own new clause 39 in detail later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First and foremost, the duty of directors is to act in the best interests of the company, as my hon. Friend has said. That requires a balance between the interests of shareholders, employees, debenture holders, creditors, even the directors themselves, the customer the suppliers and, let us say, society at large. When it is clear in law as it stands that the duty of directors is to act in the best interests of the company, is it wise to try to define that by statute? That is the question which we must face in trying to draft a new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that it is necessary to define the general duty if one is to define a specific duty to one of the categories that I mentioned. If there is a passionate desire to define the directors' duties towards employees, one must surely begin by stating the general duty of the directors—the duty to the company's interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have endeavoured to do that in new clause 39. Subsection (1) states that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The directors of a company owe a duty to the company to perform their functions in what they consider to be the best interests of the company.</p></blockquote>
Having stated that in general, if one wishes to go on to state an interest of one of the categories, one has to be careful not to create an imbalance by the further statutory definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that in both the Government's new clause and the Opposition's new clause there is an implication of a further imbalance. That is why I have endeavoured to put the two interests—the shareholders and the employees—side by side in my new clause. It does not say that the duties shall include consideration of the interests of the employees as well as of the shareholders or members. That seems to put them in different categories rather than in equal categories side by side, which is surely how we wish to define them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the interests of employees are to be mentioned, let us consider whether that is really necessary. It assumes that the employees of an incorporated company are at some disadvantage compared with employees of an employer who is not an incorporated company. Generally speaking, an employee has the same rights,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>376</span>
whether he is employed by a private unincorporated firm or by an incorporated company, but it has been shown that the employees of an incorporated body may be disadvantaged in certain circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parke 	<i>v.</i> Daily News showed that a company does not have the freedom, always enjoyed by the individual, to act to its own disadvantage, but clause 46 of the Bill reverses Parke v. Daily News. That is gone. To that extent, it has surely put employees of an incorporated body on the same level as employees of an unincorporated body. Therefore, it is questionable whether it is necessary to state the specific interests of employees of an incorporated company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may also be argued that the statement of employees' interests is made unnecessary by other legislation which gives them such full protection—the Redundancy Payments Act, the Contracts of Employment Act, the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act, the Employment Protection Act, and so on. All those Acts give employees specific rights against their employer, whether an incorporated body or an unincorporated body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, surely the directors would be failing in their duty towards the best interests of the company as a whole if they allowed a poor relationship to arise between the management and the employees, or the employer and the employees. Therefore I question whether it is necessary to define the particular interests of employees at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make one further point on that subject. Difficulties undoubtedly arise once one starts to make statutory definitions. I see one difficulty in this case and there may be many more. What is the position of the directors of a wholly-owned subsidiaries who are required by their parent company to wind up the subsidiary companies?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I presume that if any of the new clauses is accepted the directors will have a duty to the employees of the subsidiary companies. This will put them in a schizophrenic position as between their parent company and the subsidiary companies. None of the proposed new clauses solves that little problem, and I am quite sure that there may be others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me accept that there is a desire to state statutorily the right of employees of an incorporated body. In doing that, as I said before, we must see that the balance
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>377</span>
is not swung the other way, and this is what I have endeavoured to ensure in my new clause 39. First, I say that the general duty of the directors is to
	<br><blockquote><p>"consider the best interests of the company".</p></blockquote>
Secondly, they must deal with shareholders and employees on an equal basis. In other words, in determining what are the best interests of the company the directors must have regard to the interests of the members of the company and of the company's employees generally, putting them on a balanced basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, subsection (3) of my new clause repeats a subsection of the Government's clause that the duty is owed by the directors to the company. The point has already been well argued, and I do not believe that I need go further into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge that if we are to have a clause of this sort it must first and foremost state the general duty to the company. When that has been stated, if further interests are to be stated as having to be taken into account, we must try to keep a balance between them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to see one of the campaigns for the reform of company law in which I have sought an active part for a number of years bearing fruit. I congratulate my hon. Friend, the Minister on coming to the Committee with the Government's new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be remembered that in the 1973 Bill the matter was tackled by the Conservative Government at that time but only on the basis of permissive legislation rather than on the basis of the mandatory legislation which is proposed here. I always felt that it was insufficient simply to say that directors may give attention to the interests of their employees. Indeed, I felt that it was rather an insult even to legislate in such terms, but, of course, it would have been better to do that than to do nothing at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the 1973 Bill, which never reached the statute book there has been continued interest in this subject both inside and outside the House and among all parties. My hon. Friend the Member for Bosworth (Mr. Butler) brought in a Bill on the subject, and there has been a campaign for reform because of the obvious danger in which responsible boards of directors found themselves if, in acting on behalf of the employees in a way which was socially
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>378</span>
acceptable, they might be putting themselves outside the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The House of Commons has had to decide whether to adopt the code of practice approach or the alternative of introducing a mandatory obligation. I am glad that we seem to be on the brink of making concern for the interests of employees a mandatory obligation on boards of directors. There is a genuine need to do something, because directors of companies who act in accordance with accepted practice are in fact in breach of the law and may find themselves being criticised in the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) may recall that on Report on an earlier Bill I sought to introduce a measure of this kind. At that time he felt it necessary to rebuff my initiative, but I do not hold that against him because I recognise the difficulty of finding the precise form of words to pass into law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I draw the Committee's attention to my new clause 40, which is starred because I tabled it only yesterday evening? It provides the form of words on which the committee divided when we considered the question earlier in the year. This form of words was accepted by hy hon. Friends, including the Minister who is guiding our work today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend would not wish to mislead the Committee. He will no doubt recall that three amendments were tabled, and the Opposition's official amendment was the one on which, for technical reasons, we were not allowed to vote. In voting in favour of my hon. Friend's amendment I made quite clear—fortunately, I read last night the relevant part of the 	<i>Official Report</i> of that Committee—that although we supported him, it was done as a gesture of our support for the principle, and I expressed the view that our own official amendment was to be preferred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly had no intention of misleading the Committee or you, Sir Stephen, because I am sure that you remember exactly how matters proceeded. When the issue went to a tie, you, in conformity with the practice, were obliged to give your own vote against the amendment. But that is now part of history. The Government accept the need for this obligation to be made mandatory, and the Ministers are to be congratulated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>379</span>
The two questions which the Committee needs to consider are these. First, how should this intention be expressed in the form of words we adopt? Second, how do we provide for the enforcement of the new provisions when required? Both are inevitably controversial and difficult matters, and I do not believe that we shall be able to find the perfect solution at once because this touches on some of the most fundamental aspects of labour relations and company organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 40, which I can praise because I was not the originator of the form of words it contains, has a delightful elegance and simplicity and puts quite well in two lines what other hon. Members sought to express but found necessary to spin out much longer. It is more or less a reproduction of the European Commission's draft for the fifth directive, which is a guideline and not intended as a definitive text, so its attractive simplicity and obviousness do not necessarily recommend it for incorporation into British company law, which is clearly a matter on which lawyers have to be listened to, though when trying to draft amendments for company law I find that a point in, say, Foss v. Harbottle has been taken into realms of near incomprehensibility by the experts. One must recognise that as a fact of life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One reason why I wanted to table new clause 40 again, so as to bring the Committee's attention to it today, is that we are working in the context of the draft fifth directive which is under active consideration in another place—if I may adapt that expression. It envisages worker participation in the supervision of companies. My view is that in this part of the twentieth century we have to think in terms of worker democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spoke earlier about the need for the reconciliation of the two sides in industry, and I hope that, in spite of the present difficulties that are so painfully obvious even today, we can bring a sense of unity of purpose to the creation of wealth in our factories and offices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must stop the parties from playing these senseless games of Normans and Saxons that are so destructive and dangerous to our economy. We must recognise that the salaried man in the chauffeur-driven car may be just as much an obstacle to the creation of wealth as the paid ruffian on the picket line. They are playing false
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>380</span>
parts and forgetting their common obligations to themselves and to society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall make a forward move today if we approve the incorporation into our company law of the mandatory obligation on boards of directors to pay attention to the interests of employees. It is a step towards the eventual achievement of the historic compromise between capital and labour which will bring the two sides round to a recognition of their common purpose and responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty for the Committee today is that we must recognise that there is a piece missing in the mechanism of the British limited liability company. The supervisory element is defective. I have sought for many years to draw attention to this, but now, as I am sure you will remind me, Sir Stephen, is not the time to make again speeches that I have made many times. As it is increasingly recognised that the supervisory element in limited liability companies is defective, we shall not be able to legislate this morning. It is something that has to be remedied. I hope that it will be remedied in the course of this Parliament, but it cannot be done in the Committee this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we care about the health of the private sector, we should accept this half of the loaf which my hon. Friend is offering. It is quite acceptable and wholesome, and we must continue to strive to obtain eventually the other half, which is the fullen trench-meat in company law of enforceable codes of conduct in the creation of wealth which recognise the social changes affecting the status and responsibilities of the elements coming together in limited liability companies which have taken place in the twentieth century. In that sense, I hope that the Committee will not introduce too robust an element in approving my hon. Friend's initiative. I shall vote in favour of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is no reflection on the quality of all our other debates when I say that I am sure that all of us present this morning feel that this has been the most interesting debate we have had so far in Committee. Well, perhaps it is a reflection on the other debates—but let that pass.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has interested me in listening to the speeches from both sides has been the sense of unanimity in certain respects. For instance, my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Stevens) comes to this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0210">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>381</span>
Committee as a business man running his own business. The hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Mr. Roberts) arrives as a local trade union organiser. Both are in agreement in wishing to see the employees of companies better informed and having access to information. One would have expected a clash of ideas and wills, but in fact hon. Members find themselves on the same side arguing the same case. I hope I have not embarrassed the hon. Gentleman by referring to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the practice with which I am concerned, not just the theory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So are we all. The Government are in agreement with the point of view expressed by both the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend. As the hon. Member pointed out, we say in our Green Paper on company accounting and disclosure:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government consider that all companies should provide their employees with information about the financial position of the company."</p></blockquote>
He went on to quote from another section to the effect that many companies are making special efforts to make such communication. However, he did not read the next sentence, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This process of experimentation and evaluation could be undermined by the introduction of rigid statutory requirements relating to disclosure to employees, and the Government propose to treat this matter as one for companies and employees to deal with themselves."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, on this point the argument between us is simply about whether the passing into law of the Government's new clause as my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham would amend it—I know that it was not selected, Sir Stephen, but you kindly allowed us to discuss his amendment—would help in the process of the spread of information. The amendment is very specific. It refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"A copy of the company's annual report".</p></blockquote>
Companies are trying in a variety of ways to put the relevant information over to their employees. I believe that the matter would be best left as it is at present. The The Government are seeking to encourage that process, but to say that a set of annual accounts should be provided would not help. Frankly, I think that many of the things that companies provide are much more useful than a copy of the annual accounts.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) argued a strong case in favour of his new clause 39. There is no fundamental difference in objective between us. However, I wish to dwell on a specific point that he raised before dealing with his main argument. He pointed to the problem of the directors of a subsidiary company who suddenly received orders from the management of the parent company to close the factory down and wondered where their duty lay. In Clause 46, as amended, which deals with the case of Parke v. 	<i>Daily News,</i> we say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The power conferred by subsection (1) above to make any such provision may be exercised notwithstanding that its exercise is not in the best interests of the company."</p></blockquote>
So we spell matters out quite clearly. That is a point which the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington rather understated in connection with what we were doing in clause 46. We are specifically saying" There is another of the Foss 	<i>v.</i> Harbottle type of exemptions available only to employees". Even if it is against the interests of the company but it is in the employees' interests, the directors must act according to clause 46. That is an important exemption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But only in very limited circumstances, as, indeed, the Government have been at pains to point out. However, in the provisions made for minority shareholders the circumstances in which such remedies are available are enormously extended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to the hon. Gentleman's argument later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby said that in his view the main difference—I hope that I am not paraphrasing him too freely—between his clause and ours is that he felt that one should spell out clearly in subsection (1) just what the directors' main duties were, and that his subsections (2) and (3) qualify those duties and explain how they should be carried out. However, our principal objection to his new clause is to subsection (1), and I shall explain why that is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will recall that it is a principle of company law that a company's directors must exercise their powers not only 	<i>bone fide</i> in the interests of the company but also for a proper purpose—that is to say, it is necessary to determine
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>383</span>
in relation to any directorial power what was the purpose for which that power was conferred. Under present law, any exercise of a power otherwise than for the purpose of that power would be in excess of the authority of the directors, who may be liable accordingly, even if the act was done 	<i>bone fide</i> in what the directors concerned considered to be the best interests of the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend's new subsection (1) implies that, so long as directors act in what they consider to be the best interests of the company, they have discharged their duty, no matter what their purpose was. We believe that that would be a fundamental change in company law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I reply to that point? I understand my hon. Friend to say that if the directors go outside the memorandum of articles in what they think is in the best interests of the company, that may be unlawful. Of course, it may, but it would also not be in the best interests of the company. If the directors overstep their powers in the company, that cannot possibly be said to be in its best interests because it lays the company open to being wound up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend and I must disagree. I believe that in subsection (1) he makes a much more fundamental change than he implies. He is not restating the present position. However, I do not doubt that we can return to the matter in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the remarks of the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis). There is a gap between us—a difference in approach which he clearly stated. He said that our new clause puts employees and shareholders on a different footing, and he cited the exemptions that are available for minority shareholders, for instance, which would not be available to employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is wrong to pretend that in company law one can ever put employees and shareholders on exactly the same footing. We are trying to say that the directors have one duty, which is to the company at large. In carrying out that duty, they will now have a mandatory duty—not permissive—to take into account the interests of the employees. We believe that it is much better for the directors to retain their solitary duty to the company as a whole, and that in interpreting that duty they will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>384</span>
now be under an obligation to take into account the interests of the employees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And if they do not take those interests into account?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then there is the same right to take action against them as the shareholders have, with the exceptions in the case of Foss 	<i>v.</i> Harbottle roughly cancelled out by the statutory rights that employees have, which are considerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have listened today to arguments that almost imply that the whole of company law and the industrial scene are weighted solidly in favour of the shareholders. That is a travesty of the present position. It ignores the existence of trade unions, which is a very important factor, and the collective power of the work force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anybody in our modern industrial society who believes that the real power resides in the hands of the shareholders is totally out of tune with reality. The truth is that if there is a balance of power it is tilted very firmly in the direction of organised labour. I say that not in a controversial way but in an attempt to give a little perspective to our debate. Arguments seem to have been put from a slightly lopsided view. One has a picture of a defenceless labour force in the hands of the directors obsessed with looking after the shareholders at the workers' expense. That is not the way it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not doing himself justice. He knows, as I pointed out earlier, that the main purpose of our move in the direction we suggest is that unless we do so we cannot march in the direction of industrial democracy, with supervisory boards and worker directors on boards. It is an absolute condition precedent to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept that. There is nothing in our new clause which prevents developments of that kind. I believe that it leaves the way open for companies to experiment in a variety of ways for bringing the labour force more and more into decision making. It is not fair to allege otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument—the hon. Member for Hackney, Central was right—boils down to a simple but major point of difference between us. The Government believe that the directors should have a single duty to the company as a whole. In carrying out that duty they should be under a statutory
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0212">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>385</span>
obligation to take into account the interests of the employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition want to create a dual duty. We believe that that would give rise to vexatious litigation which would reinforce adversary politics in business. It would create conflict and would not promote the harmony and good will which we believe is essential if we are to make industrial progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is that fundamental difference between us, and I thank goodness that the Conservative Party is in Government and that our view will prevail, because I strongly believe that we are right in our approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn finally to my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams). May I once again—it is almost becoming a bore—pay tribute to him for arguing cases which gradually swing the rest of us over. He never varies. There are moments—I am sure he will not mind me saying this—when I am less pleased to hear his views than others. But he is persistent. He has a clear objective. He believes that if we are to regenerate the British economy it is vital that we do so against a background of modern company law which will allow that process to continue. I admire him for his efforts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that brevity is the soul of wit, but it is not always the only qualification for a new clause. In fact, for reasons which roughly accord with some of the arguments I used—which my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby did not find convincing, but which I hope my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington does—we believe our new clause to be preferable to new clause 40. The fifth directive may be on the way, but the fact that it is on the way does not mean that we accept it. That directive will have to be worked over very carefully, and—I must be truthful with my hon. Friend—I have not got round to doing that yet. I am, therefore, glad to have his support for our new clause. I invite my right hon. and hon. Friends to vote in favour of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never learn by experience. Each time the hon. Gentleman rises to his feet with a benign expression on his face and begins by declaring that the Committee is basically unanimous, I think he is about to announce that the Government have listened to the arguments with an open mind and are to make some concessions. Alas, the event always belies my
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>386</span>
optimism. The hon. Gentleman explains that we are all unanimous and then rejects all our arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will remember that:

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is something else I have learnt today. However, it is true that there has been a wide measure of agreement in the Committee. We all seem to be in agreement that some employees—probably many employees—have a larger real interest in the affairs of a company than do many of the shareholders. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Mr. Roberts) said this morning, an employee may well have devoted 50 years of his working life, day in and day out, to the interests of a company, while a shareholder did not know the name of the company until he picked up a bundle of shares last week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone agrees that if a company behaves as any decent responsible individual would behave, the directors should not be liable to proceedings for a breach of trust or find themselves the subject of a complaint by a minority of shareholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Speaking for myself, I was most interested in the proposal of the hon. Member for Fulham (Mr. Stevens) that employees should have a statutory right to information about matters which closely concern their lives in both the present and the future. The Minister says "Many of the best companies are doing this already—would it not be better to let it go like that?" Of course, it is not normally for the best companies that we legislate. It might encourage the best companies to know that some of the less attractive companies also will be compelled to incur what is, after all, a very marginal cost. If the hon. Member for Fulham is minded to divide the Committee on this issue I hope that my hon. Friends will support him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the basic issue, the Government agree that employees should have a right to a fair consideration of their interests when the directors are arriving at decisions relating to the company. But it is to be a right that gives rise to no course of action. It is what those of us who used to attend lectures on jurisprudence heard described as an inchoate right. The shareholders, can
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0213">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>387</span>
in certain circumstances enforce their rights because, as the Minister said, there are exceptions to the rule in Foss v. Harbottle which give them a right to bring action where their right could not be defeated simply by a resolution in a general meeting. We had a discussion on this last week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had other interesting discussions, as the Minister will perhaps come to understand if he reads the 	<i>Official Report</i> of our meetings when he was absent—through no fault of his, of course. Last week we had an interesting discussion about some of the exceptions to the rule in Foss	<i>v.</i> Harbottle. The fact is that there are no corresponding rights open to employees and the Government are not proposing to give them any.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that of course employees have some rights which weigh in the balance because they have important rights about redundancy payments. If one of the ladies in the Minister's harem has occasion to claim maternity leave, she will have a right to do so. We agree that at present there are important rights vested in employees, but, surely, that is not what we are talking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If those rights were sufficient, this debate would never have taken place. The Government accept that something more is needed—presumably, that is why they proposed the new clause. As my hon. Friend said a few moments ago, we say that substantially more is needed than the list of rights that arise out of contracts embellished by statutory rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) pointed out that what the Government are proposing is that there shall be a mandatory obligation upon directors to have regard to the interests of the company's employees. The Government accept that that is something that ought to be added to the rights which exist at present. Therefore, they say, this mandatory obligation ought to exist, but there should be no method of enforcing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the right hon. and learned Gentleman really saying that the only rights that shareholders have which matter arc the exceptions to Foss v. Harbottle, that their general rights are of no consequence at all and that it is only the few exceptions that matter? That is the implication of his remarks. We are saying that in carrying out the duty to the com-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>388</span>
pany the directors must indeed take account of the interests of the shareholders. The right hon. and learned Gentleman then says that the shareholders have important special rights, citing Foss 	<i>v.</i> Harbottle. I agree that there are some special rights there, but those are not the important rights. They are not the only rights that the shareholders have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, indeed. There the hon. Gentleman and I are very much at one. I thought that he was placing emphasis on the exceptions to the rule in Foss 	<i>v.</i> Harbottle. Of course, the shareholders have other important rights. The shareholders can attend the general meeting; the employees can do no such thing. The shareholders can vote out the directors; the employees have no corresponding right of that kind. As I ventured to say on Second Reading, and as the hon. Gentleman himself has said, one cannot make the two things entirely parallel because shareholders are members of the company and employees are not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that there is anything in the way in which the Almighty created the world which makes that essential, but that is the way in which it has developed and that is the position at the moment. So the shareholders have important and much more extensive rights. I accept that. For that reason, I thought, the Government were saying that we should at least try to give this right to employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, having done that, the Government say that the employees will be given no method of enforcing that right. They cannot turn up at a general meeting and vote out the directors, they cannot pass resolutions, and they have none of the exceptions to the rule arising out of Foss v. Harbottle. So what is really left, except a defence to an action? If that were all that was required, this debate would not have taken place. The Government accept that something more than that is needed. They accept that there should be a mandatory direction to directors to take account of the rights of employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the day, therefore, there is a yawning gap between the two sides of the Committee. After all the unanimity, the Government now say that they will not give employees any rights that they can enforce, beyond those that they have already. The Opposition say that that is so much claptrap unless the employees have a right which is enforceable.

	<ol>
	<li>This section applies to any term by which a director's employment with the company of which he is the director or, where he is the director of a holding company, his employment within the group is to continue, or may be continued, otherwise than at the instance of the company (whether under the original agreement or under a new agreement entered into in pursuance of the original agreement), for a period exceeding five years during which the agreement—</li>

	<li>a person is employed with a company under an agreement which cannot be terminated by the company by notice or can be so terminated only in specified circumstances; and</li>
	<li>more than six months before the expiration of the period for which he is so employed, the company enters into a further agreement (otherwise than in pursuance of a right conferred by or by virtue of the original agreement on the other party thereto) under which his employment with the company or, where he is a director of a holding company, within the group is to be continued or may be continued otherwise than at the instance of the company.</li>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause is the first of a series of provisions designed to impose stricter regulations on company directors in situations of potential conflicts of interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be appropriate to tell the Committee at this stage that we intend to table an amendment shortly that will extend new clauses 21 to 36 to cover, wherever appropriate, persons—individual or corporate—on whose instructions the directors are accustomed to act. The concept of such persons, whom we can for the moment refer to as "shadow" directors in recognition of their operation behind
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0215">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>391</span>
the scenes as 	<i>de facto</i> directors, is not new, as it is enshrined for various purposes in both the 1948 and the 1967 Companies Acts. The application of our clauses to these "shadow" directors is likely to prevent many of the obvious abuses to which these provisions would otherwise be open. We hope to be able to table this important amendment in time for discussion in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a question of whether it is in time for the Committee but of whether it is in time for us to consider it before we have to debate it. I hope that my hon. Friend will bear that in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I shall most certainly bear that in mind. We shall endeavour to give the maximum possible notice. My hon. Friend the Minister for Trade has also indicated the additional way in which we shall try to help members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 21 is designed to prevent the abuse whereby directors enter into longterm service contracts with their company—on terms set by themselves or their colleagues on the board—thereby effectively circumventing the provisions of section 184 of the 1948 Act, which empowers the shareholders to dismiss without compensation a director from his duties as director at any time but which does not affect any rights to compensation which a director may have under any other contract for services with the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The director's position is most clearly abused when such long-term service contracts are agreed in anticipation of a move by the shareholders to dismiss him, as in the period prior to a takeover. Shareholders in this situation have to choose between not dismissing a director or paying him substantial compensation in respect of the unexpired part of his contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The possibility of abuse of this sort has been widely recognised for some time. Provisions to protect companies against it are contained in the Stock Exchange listing agreement. Our clause, however, goes further than both the listing agreement and the relevant clause in the previous Companies Bill, which, we believe, left open possible paths of evasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>392</span>
The listing agreement requires that, in listed companies
	<br><blockquote><p>"any service contract granted by the company, or any subsidiary of the company, to any director or proposed director of the company not expiring or determinable within 10 years by the employing company without payment of compensation (other than statutory compensation) must be made subject to the approval of the company in general meeting."</p></blockquote>
Our clause applies the general policy of this requirement to all Companies Act companies, and restricts the length of unapproved service agreements to five rather than 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee may have noticed that the word "agreement" has in this context replaced the more familiar term "contract of employment". This is not just a simple drafting change. It in fact represents the main departure between our clause and the similar provision in the previous Government's Bill. The purpose of the more general term "agreement" is to prevent rather obvious evasive devices—in particular, the device by which a director arranges for a service or consultancy contract to be entered into with his personal company. In this case there is no "contract of employment" with the director personally, though the practical effect of such an arrangement is exactly the same as if there were. The use of the word "agreement" is a convenient way of covering all such evasive arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general prohibition set out in subsection (1) therefore refers to the inclusion in any agreement of
	<br><blockquote><p>"a term to which this section applies"</p></blockquote>
and the relevant term is defined in subsection (2)as any term by which a director's employment with his company may be continued for more than five years without reference to the company's approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prohibition is limited to those terms which have not been approved by the company in general meeting, as the alternative approach of prohibiting companies altogether from granting long-term service agreements is too restrictive. There is no inherent vice in such agreements provided that they are approved by the company and not simply drawn up by the directors to protect their own positions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general prohibition also applies to agreements between a company's director and any subsidiary of that company. This is necessary to prevent avoidance of the new clause by a director negotiating
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0216">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>393</span>
agreements with a company controlled by the company of which he is a director.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should note that the prohibition applies only to the term, or terms, in the agreement relating to duration of the agreement rather than to the whole agreement, so that any contract implied by the agreement which is distinct from the terms relating to duration is to remain valid, and enforceable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The offending term, however, is made void by virtue of subsection (5) and is deemed to be replaced by a term allowing the company to terminate the agreement at any time, provided that reasonable notice is given. If the duration term contains an option which can be taken up by the director without further reference to the company to extend the service contract, and this extension would take the agreement above the five-year limit, the whole duration term, not just the option to extend, is to be made void. Thus, there is a not inconsiderable incentive to ensure that contracts to which the clause applies are properly approved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) prevents an obvious abuse by providing that where, during the course of an existing agreement, a new agreement is entered into the effect of which is to extend the director's period of employment for more than five years from the date at which the second agreement is entered into, that agreement must be approved by the company even though the period specified in the second agreement does not exceed five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An example of the sort of abuse that is thus prevented is where a director during the first year of a four-year contract, without the approval of the company, enters into a further four-year contract so as to allow a total continuous period of nearly eight years. We are, however, providing an exemption to allow for an agreement entered into within six months before the expiration of any existing agreement. This is clearly necessary to allow for the perfectly normal and proper renewal of an agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions of subsection (4) ensure that all shareholders, irrespective of their right to attend and vote, have adequate time to acquaint themselves with the terms of any long-term service agreement before it is voted on. It also provides that the details must be available at the general meeting concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All wholly-owned subsidiaries of any
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>394</span>
company, however incorporated, are excluded from the provisions of this clause, as are all companies other than companies registered under the Companies Acts. The intention of these exclusions, set out in subsection (6), is to exclude from the requirement to give approval all bodies corporate in respect of which the requirement could not be implemented or enforced—that is, bodies such as nationalised industries which do not have shareholders as such—or where such a requirement is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that this requirement is unnecessary for any wholly-owned subsidiaries whether of a Companies Act company or of any other kind of company, on the ground that, as such subsidiaries are simply the operational units of the holding company, the directors of these subsidiary units—provided they are not also directors of the holding company, in which case they are caught under subsection (1)—can be regarded more as " managers " of these units whose conditions of service are therefore the responsibility of the directors of the holding company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very difficult to follow all this, but one of the mischiefs which we were anxious to try to avert under the previous Companies Bill—no doubt it is caught somewhere, probably in subsection (2)—is the situation of a longterm consultancy arrangement taking the place of a contract of employment. I did not actually hear the hon. Gentleman refer to that, but perhaps he has. I am not sure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did refer to consultancy agreements, and I believe that that point has been completely met in subsection (7)(	<i>a</i>). This states that "employment" includes services. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has nothing to worry about in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was referring to conditions of service that are the responsibility of the directors of the holding company. It should be noted that the definition of "employment" includes
	<br><blockquote><p>"employment under a contract for services".</p></blockquote>
The law draws a distinction between contracts of employment and contracts for services which include arrangements such as consultancy contracts—that is precisely the point raised by the hon. Member for Hackney, Central—whereby a director may be paid fees for advice and is not treated for the purposes of tax and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0217">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>395</span>
employment protection as an employee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our extension of the definition of "employment" is therefore designed to prevent evasion of the provisions of the clause by directors who would otherwise be able to enter into lucrative long-term consultancy arrangements in place of contracts of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I should mention the disclosure provisions concerning directors' contracts. Section 26 of the 1967 Act, which deals with such disclosure, will need amendment to cover the various changes made by these new provisions. The section requires that directors' service contracts are to be open to inspection by the company's members. We shall be extending this so that it covers contracts of service between directors of holding companies and their subsidiaries. We also intend to limit the present exemption from disclosure for service contracts which require the director to work wholly or mainly outside the United Kingdom, so that disclosure of all terms in such contracts relating to length of service will now be required. We hope to be able to table these amendments to section 26 of the 1967 Act for consideration on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any agreements of the kind mentioned in new clause 21 which are not covered by section 26 of the 1967 act as amended—for example, agreements made with companies controlled by directors—will be required to be disclosed in the accounts by new clause 28.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the fact that the Government have strengthened the provisions of our Bill. There is today a unanimity of purpose between the Government Front Bench and the Opposition in at least seeking to ensure that the law avoids the kind of squalid abuse that was witnessed in a number of cases that were the subject of inspectors' reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember one case—I think it was Lonrho—where the position was wholly abused by, among others, Lord Sandys, and the company had aided and abetted that. It is comforting that the Government have agreed the line which we took previously, and we are now able to endorse their proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Stephen. Is it acceptable for the hon. Gentleman to make a quite serious charge
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>396</span>
against a Member of the other House without that noble Lord being advised?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is certainly out of order for the hon. Gentleman to pass remarks that are derogatory of Members of another place. They should take the form of a motion and not be raised in the course of a speech. But I think that the hon. Gentleman skated over it quite quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I said anything that was out of order, of course I apologise. I merely referred the Committee to the Lonrho report, which speaks for itself and does not need me to emphasise any of its indictments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A somewhat ambivalent attitude is being adopted by the Government this morning, because here we are talking yet again about provisions in the law that need to be changed to catch that unworthy group of directors who commit abuses of the law. Having listened to the Minister for Trade this morning, one would have thought that such an animal hardly existed. I believe that this goes to show that the Government have not thought out their approach to the whole of these matters, including those we discussed previously, in any sort of sensible philosophical way. However, there it is. I shall not prolong the debate, and I have no doubt that I should be out of order in seeking to revive that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the Minister has been able to reassure me on the anxiety that I raised in an intervention. It was mentioned in the previous debates, and I am satisfied that the Government have cured that particular defect in the law. So we welcome the Government's approach in this respect, and we hope that it will be commended by the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seem to be living in another world from that of the two Front Benches, unless I have completely misunderstood the clause. May I say that, as an ordinary solicitor in general practice and not one in a firm such as Linklaters and Paines dealing with large companies all the time, my company law was chiefly related to the firm which some enterprising man had built up and wanted money to develop yet further. He had all the know-how, he knew how to run the firm and did not want to sell out but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0218">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>397</span>
wanted capital to come in. He wanted the capital not in his own pocket but in order to develop the firm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are we really to say by this clause "You shall not make a bargain when you form that firm into an incorporated company and should you have a contract with that company "—frequently a life contract, which is quite common—" that will be unlawful. You may get around that by taking 51 per cent. of the shares, but if you do so you will probably not get in the capital to develop the undertaking"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me wrong—when it was such a common practice in the past—that the man who has the know-how and wants the capital and therefore incorporates the business in order to get in that capital can be excluded from carrying on in the business that he has chosen. Can there never be another William Morris moving on to incorporation of the bicycle repair shop in Cowley Road, Oxford? Can there never be another Harry Pilkington moving on from the small glass blowing concern? Can there never be another John Moores or Cecil Moores of Littlewoods?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are people who started in a small way and then decided that they wished to get in more capital to develop their undertakings but to remain in them themselves. They did not want to cripple the business by saying "I want a large sum of money in my own pocket here and now". They said "I shall go on working in this business if I have a contract so to work".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I read new clause 21, unless such people today retain in their own hands a majority of the shares, they can be chucked out the next day by the majority shareholders in general meeting. This seems to me to sabotage the development of company law as we have known it over past generations, and the development of the limited liability which has been the basis of our industrial and commercial development over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I am misreading the clause and that it does not mean that never again can there be a life directorship for the man who has created a business and wants to develop it by incorporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend can shoot me down and tell me that that is not the intention of the clause—that there is some escape from that provision. However, as I read the clause, having heard both Front Benches on the subject, I came to the conclusion that it just about sabotaged my
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>398</span>
ordinary experience of the development of industry and commerce by limited liability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), from his experience, has spoken in strong terms on behalf of the man who, mainly in the smaller range of companies, has the know-how and whose service to the company is such that he should be allowed to maintain a long-term contract with it. The answer to my right hon. Friend is certainly "Yes," provided that such an arrangement has the approval of the shareholders. As I have made clear, that approval is given by the company in general meeting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Undoubtedly, in a great number of cases of the type that my right hon. Friend has in mind there is a man who may well be the founder of the company and who has the qualities to which he referred. In these instances, no doubt such agreement to the continuation of arrangements on the basis that I have described would be forth-coming. The strength of the points that my right hon. Friend made with regard to the qualities of such a man would, of course, be recognised in the company. Therefore, there would be every prospect of that man who is able to give such great service to the company, continuing his period of service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend cannot ride off on that basis. Of course, the man's qualities may be recognised, but for that very reason it may be desirable for those who hold a majority of the shares to get rid of him and seize the whole undertaking for their future benefit. Under this provision, I understand that he would not even have any compensation for the termination of his contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause nullifies good contracts between a company and an individual without the necessity of paying compensation for making that contract void. As I said, quite possibly that individual, can escape by retaining the majority of shares, but in those circumstances he may find it very difficult to raise the capital required for the development of the company. In many instances all the man desires is to continue to develop the undertaking and to be involved in it himself. He is probably happy to have those better trained in finance than he is to control and manage it, but he still wants to be in it himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, such a man is prepared to sell his services, his know-how, his past
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0219">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>399</span>
experience, and to sell the firm that he has built up not for a capital sum but for security for himself. That is certainly not what he is given under the clause. The man who has had the brains to develop the undertaking over the years is told "Yes, you can enter into a contract, you can have a life directorship, but that can be terminated at any time without any compensation for you" Instead of selling his business for security and not cash, he will find that he has lost completely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who have to advise a man in those circumstances will say " Do not take a contract of service with the new company. Get out of it altogether. Take a large sum of money and set up again somewhere else." There will therefore be a splitting up of interests. I can see enormous problems arising. I hope that my hon. Friend will put in some protection for the sort of case that I have sought to explain to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, one gives serious consideration to the points which my right hon. Friend raises. But in most cases in the first category which my right hon. Friend was speaking about of the powerful founder continuing, my right hon. Friend will agree that a man in that position retains the majority of the shareholding. Therefore, the question of a decision at a general meeting does not cause difficulty for him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the proposition that my hon. Friend has just advanced is highly dubious. It by no means invariably follows that the entrepreneur retains the majority of the shareholding in the circumstances described by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are reaching the final moments of our debate today and I hope that, before we return to complete our consideration of the new clause, my hon. Friend will have been able to give it more thought, because there is a real problem here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall, of course, note the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Stevens) in support of the original point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby. But I believe that in a great many cases where my right hon. Friend was speaking so strongly on behalf of the founder—the entrepreneur who has made a great contribution to the company—a man of that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>400</span>
character does retain the majority shareholding. But I shall consider the points raised by my right hon. and hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other cases, as the history of the company goes on, there is a tendency for the shares to be disposed of and different situations arise. In most cases where one is talking about a person who is able to make a valuable contribution to the work of the company, I am sure that that would be recognised and there would be no difficulty at the general meeting of the company in continuing the contract of the person who is able to make such a contribution to the company's future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend made another point about the raising of capital, which I appreciate can be very important to the work and future of the company. Again, I think that in most cases it is not an essential requirement that, on the provision of credit by some agency, the agency will require the especially powerful founder member of the company to whom my right hon. Friend referred to give up the majority of the shareholding. It is true that in a great many cases a substantial shareholding is taken by the agency providing finance, but I believe such agencies do not in normal circumstances require that the person seeking further finance for the company shall actually give up the majority shareholding.
