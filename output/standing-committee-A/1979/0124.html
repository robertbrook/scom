Otherwise, he would wish to be here to express personally his great pleasure that you are to preside over our proceedings, Mr. Goodhew.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Looking around the Committee, I am glad to see at least one or two faces familiar from previous occasions when we have been round this course. For my part, I feel that I have been going backwards and forwards over some of these issues half my life, and I am bound to say that I may have to take some time to readjust to having the sunlight in my eyes in this Committee rather than at my back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not the first time both in Committee and in the House that we have debated ballots, which are the subject of clause 1. It happened in 1975, and again much more recently. Nor is it the first time that we have debated the role of ACAS relating to any proposed ballots in connection with industrial disputes, the election of trade union officials and the other matters covered by the clause, although I must say that when, in the debates on the Employment Protection Bill, as it was, in 1975 we debated an amendment from the then Opposition to give ACAS a role in these matters, it was a very different role from that which we are envisaging now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I recall, the right hon. Member for Lowestoft (Mr. Prior) was suggesting then, seeking to write into the Bill, an obligation on ACAS to produce codes and also to regulate the implementation of codes on balloting. We are proposing something very different. However, I am encouraged by the fact that as long ago as that the right hon. Member for Lowestoft and his hon. Friend's were prepared to consider that ACAS had a role in these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that I say something about how we envisaged the role of' ACAS and the raison d'etre of its establishment when it was conceived back in I974, for. indeed, it was set up by administrative action, if I recall correctly, before it was given the statutory base that it now has under the Employment Protection Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will recall that in those days there was a widespread feelingâ€”whether it was well founded is another matterâ€”that there was an excessive involvement by Government and Ministers in the day-to-day management of industrial relations, and there was a widespread feeling that it would be better if the Government withdrew from that excessive involvement and left the day-to-day management of industrial relations, the regulation of disputes, the development of policy and the formulation of initiatives in these matters

to those involved in them from day to day, namely, management, trade union officials and others.

This was the underlying idea of the establishment of the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service, partly so that those who would be beneficiaries, I presume to say, of the work of the Service would have confidence that it was an independent Service, that it was not the tool of Ministers and the Government, that it was not perhaps being used to implement whatever pay policy of the day there might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was very much the theme on which ACAS was established. It was never intended to mean that the Government had no involvement or responsibility in these matters. Obviously, the Government cannot stand aloof from these matters when the public interest is affected by for, example, industrial disputes. One thinks of the steel industry. It is not a private matter between the workers in the steel industry and the British Steel Corporation. The current dispute is one which has a serious effect on the public interestâ€”indeed, on the national interest. The Government have a responsibility for the public interest, the national interest, We envisaged then that in those circumstances, where the public interest was jeopardised, Ministers not only had a right but had a responsibility and duty to involve themselves to safeguard the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, I should be out of order if I were to talk about the steel dispute, but I think that I might fairly make the point that we believe that the Government are right to have assumed a role now in this dispute. We Very much regret that they did not do it earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong to assume that we intended the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service that was the only agency, the only instrument of outside involvement in such very serious disputes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I now turn to the question of the ballots and why we think ACAS should be involved. The first point to note is that here the Secretary of State is taking unto himself a power which will involve him in these matters without putting an obligation on him to consult anyone. There is no suggestion anywhere in the clause that he should have any consultation at all about the ballot which he is proposing to fund if those concerned wish funds to be made availableâ€”not the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Trades Union Congress, not any of the trade unions, not the CBI, no one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that it would be wrong for the Secretary of State to act unilaterally without consultation, without seeking guidance from anyone. Perhaps the most sensible thing, and the least that the Government should be required to do, is to talk to these people whom I described as being involved in, and representative of, those who are concerned with the day-to-day management and regulation of industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should recognise that ballotsâ€”heaven knows, we as Members of Parliament should realise this better than anyone else perhaps, are not just a simple matter of distributing ballot papers, allowing someone to put a cross and then gathering them together and counting the votes. We all know that it is a much more elaborate, complex and lengthy process than that. There is all the business of informing those who would be required to put their cross about where they should put it. We engage in lengthy persuasion of the electorate at considerable costâ€”the printing of leaflets, the election addresses, the canvassing and so onâ€”all an essential and integral part of the democratic process if the crosses are to go in the right places eventually.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it would help the Committee in reaching a decision on these matters if the Under-Secretary of State were to give some guidance about the extent to which the Government envisage these funds being available. Is it merely to be for the mechanical process of putting the cross on the paper and having the paper printed? Does it even cover the cost of printing? I do not know. These are enormously expensive matters, as we all know. I think of what is now the current limit for general elections. I know that I must be careful now if I hazard a guess about the amount I spent at the last general election. I had better be cautious, but it was certainly a large sum, and that was for merely one election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very well spent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was indeed well spent. It certainly had the return that the electors of Doncaster hoped for. But, that apart, I suggest that we ought to look at this question in terms of all the activities associated with ballots in respect of advis-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0506">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
ing, informing, persuading, and cajoling so that we reach the right democratic result. It might be helpful if the Under-Secretary were to tell us something about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the theme of the amendment, namely, that the Secretary of State should be required to take outside guidance and advice, guidance which can be impartial. The Under-Secretary has kindly and thoughtfully provided the Committee with background notes on clauses, a development which I welcome and one which I hope will be copied elsewhere. In the background note on clause I, the Under-Secretary says that the Government are acting in accordance with the Conservative Party's manifesto and that what they told the electors at the time of the election was right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no criticism of that, except to say that, with the best will in the world, the electors are not the best advisers on these matters. To respond for the sake of getting votes to what may be a popular demand at a particular time is not necessarily the best or the right action in these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are occasions when expert advice ought to be sought notâ€”for the want of a better expressionâ€”from the popular mass. To follow what is the demand of the mass in this situation is perhaps to follow and not to lead, perhaps even to lead us down the road towards government by referenda rather than government based on policy arrived at by a consideration of what is right, appropriate and best in the circumstances. I maintain that the best guides in this situation are those who, based on their experience, know what will be the consequences of particular actions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that although ACAS does not have a monopoly of understanding, experience and wisdom in these matters, if the Government are to be required to turn to any body they may as well be required to turn to ACAS as to anywhere else. The amendment does not, of course, impose a mandatory obligation on the Secretary of State to do whatever ACAS may advise him, but naturally, Parliament as well as the country will expect the right hon. Gentleman to take full account of the advice given. We seek merely to require the Secretary of State to consult ACAS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when the hon. and learned Gentleman replies he will say more than
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
that the Government are happy to accept the amendments. At the outset of our discussionsâ€”I am sure that it will figure again and again in our debatesâ€”I suggest that this is an appropriate time for the Under-Secretary to explain how the new Government see the role of ACAS developing. We shall need to know more, too, about some of the other measures in the Bill which seem to me not only to diminish the role of ACAS but to reduce that body to a role that might make some of the council members wonder whether it is worth while to continue giving up their valuable time for what will be very limited objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will say something, too, about the matters on which I have touched in respect of ballots. To what extent does he envisage the aid being available? I shall not trespass on another amendment on the Notice Paper, but I tell the Under-Secretary that we shall want to discuss that later in relation to the other purposes for which provision is made in the clause in addition to the specific provisions in subsection (3). Perhaps at this stage the Under-Secretary will give us some wider indication than is contained in the Bill about how the Government see the ballot provisions applying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to know a little more about this, and my few remarks will be couched generally in the interrogative to the Minister. I am rather Surprised at the uncharacteristic open-handedness of the Government and their generosity to the trade union movement. Normally we are used to homilies about the need to restrain public expenditure. It seems rather uncharacteristic to hand out these vast sums of money. It could well be that the trade unions will be grateful. I have seen reference to Â£2 million of taxpayers' money. I am not sure how this figure is arrived at and I should like to know a little more about that. We know that public money is given to political parties. I am not sure how much that amounts to, but I suspect that the offer from the Government here is to give more money to the trade unions than they give to the political parties. That seems an interesting suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea of ballots in the trade union movement is not novel. One would have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0507">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
from the Government the impression that the trade unions as a rule do not have ballots and we ought to use vast sums of public money to encourage them to have them. Ballots are really their mode of working and existence. There are far more secret ballots in the trade union movement than, perhaps, in any other part of our society. As I look across at hon. Members on the Government benches, I am not quite sure how they got thereâ€”whether they were elected or selected by their colleagues and their party. I am sure that they are the best available representatives of their party, but were they selected or elected? In the trade union movement this is all done by election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the Tory Party what tends to happen is that ballots are so secret that we never know anything about them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I think that that could be the explanation. Let me say that, before my transformation on 3rd May I earned my living as a printer, as a trade unionist in the printing of newspapers, We have what we call chapels, and our chief shop steward is known as the father of the chapel. No one is quite sure whyâ€”I think it goes back to the days when monks did the printing. We constantly have elections which cost us a hell of a lot of money. We have quarterly meetings which every member is obliged to attend. If the members do not attend they are fined. If they were to be so remiss as to miss three meetingsâ€”to use a phrase I heard the Prime Minister use recentlyâ€”on the trot, they are liable to expulsion from the union, which is quite a serious matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, one might say, we force people to be democrats. There is no question of small cabals organising things. The chapels have wide powers. They decide the seniority of jobs. If people want to change the way they work, they move resolutions. Things are done in that way. If a member thinks that he has extenuating circumstances and should be put on another job, he moves a resolution at the chapel. Many managerial prerogatives are happily handed over by the management to the chapels. If a member misbehaves himself, instead of the management's having to discipline him the trade union takes on that onerous obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chapel committees are thus very
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
influential bodies, and before I came hereâ€”I shall not mention their names; why should I give them free advertisement?â€”I was on the committees of the largest-selling daily paper and the largest-selling Sunday paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our committees are elected quarterly. Every quarter the whole lot come up for re-election. The nearest thing I know to Athenian direct democracy is the way we run the printing trade unions. It costs a lot of money to print the ballot papers. Our branch committees are all elected. The scrutineers are elected; they have to have time off from work to count the votes, which costs money. Our general secretary and all our officers are elected once every three years. All wage claims, which are annual, have to go to the members for acceptance, and so does every change of rule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I hope that he will be able to tell us how this fits in with the question of consultation with ACAS. Fascinating though it is to hear what he describesâ€”I was particularly fascinatedâ€”I am not sure whether it is strictly connected with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I want to know is whether I can give the good news to my union that, after consultation with ACAS, the vast expense that we incur for our constant elections will now be met out of taxpayers' money. For example, there is a ballot going on at the moment to increase the political levy. In view of the Government's behaviour, the chances of this being successful are high. Perhaps the main purpose of this would be for the union to sponsor me as their sponsored Member of Parliament. That is a consummation devoutly to be wished in the national interest, no doubt, I am certain that the union would be very happy to have this procedure paid for by taxpayers' money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to know the extent of what is proposed and just how generous the Government will be. Will they, after their discussions with ACAS, finance all these elections which we have all the time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say at the outset how delighted I am that you are chairing the Committee, Mr. Goodhew. I am sure that I speak on behalf of the hon. Member for Norfolk, South (Mr. Mac-

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Gregor), too, in welcoming you to the Committee. We certainly enjoyed the privilege of your excellent Chairmanship in the Committee which we have just concluded, and we both look forward here to the same excellent cooperation which we had with you. I am sure that this Committee will be a fairly long runner. How long it will run will be an interesting matter, which I hope the hon. Member for Norfolk, South and I will be discussing over the next few weeks, or perhaps even months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a fundamental amendment on which it is only right that we have considerable discussion. The Under-Secretary has generously provided us with an explanatory note, and I am grateful for that; it is certainly appreciated. We had long and involved arguments on the Industry Bill Committee on this very question, and I detect the hand of the hon. Member for Norfolk, South in persuading his colleagues in the Department of Employment to forgo the arguments which we had in that Committee by providing these notes on clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clause 1 tell us:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is envisaged that the costs to be defined in the regulations will be the printing and stationery costs of voting papers and a reasonable amount of explanatory literature, and envelopes for their issue and return, together with the postal costs of the cheapest available means of sending and returning them."</p></blockquote>
In other words, we are entering into uncharted waters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is obvious from the composition of the Committee that there is virtually no trade union experience whatsoever on the Government side. One only has to look through the list to recognise that the vast majority would not recognise a trade unionist if they fell over one. It will be interesting to see their attitude on this question. If there are hon. Gentlemen opposite who have wide trade union experience, I shall be only too delighted to hear what they have to say on the amendment. As I say, the waters here are uncharted, and it is essential that the Under-Secretary listens to the views of those of us who have wide experience in the trade union movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the benefit of everyone in the Committee, I had better declare my interest in that I am a Member sponsored by the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers, engineering section, which,
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
I am sure you are aware, Mr. Goodhew, even if the hon. Gentlemen opposite are not, probably has the world record for holding ballots on almost every position within the union. We have great experience in this important field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to what clause I would do. There is reference to a number of issues on which ballots would be held:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>a</i>) obtaining a decision or ascertaining the views of members of a trade union as to the calling or ending of a strike or other industrial action."</p></blockquote>
I am sure we shall spend a lot of time when we come to that subsection later on.
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>b</i>) electing a person to the committee of management of a trade union or, if the union does not have a committee of management, to the body exercising the functions of a committee of management;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>c</i>) electing a person to any post which he will hold as an employee of a trade union."</p></blockquote>
I am sure we shall have long deliberations on what is meant by "an employee" of a trade union.
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>d</i>) amending the rules of a trade union;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>e</i>) obtaining a decision in accordance with the Trade Union (Amalgamations, etc) Act 1964 on a resolution to approve an instrument of amalgamation or transfer;"</p></blockquote>
Then we come to the dangerous words in line 15:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and such other purposes as the Secretary of State may by order specify."</p></blockquote>
The background to the amendment is that the Secretary of State has very little knowledge in this sphere of trade union activity. The thrust of the amendment moved by my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) is that the Secretary of State should seek expert assistance in the drawing up of the code, because, as I have outlined, we are in difficult and dangerous waters on the issues which the clause attempts to cover where ballots may or may not be held.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We argue that the Secretary of State should seek expert assistance. There is no agreement within the trade union movement. Indeed, there is no agreement between individual trade unions as to how a ballot should be conducted or what ballots should be for. If the Secretary of State for Employment, particularly in a Conservative Government who obviously have a bad reputation already with the trade union movement, is seeking to impose his views on what the code of practice should be on ballots, the reaction of the overwhelming majority of trade unionists, probably including even the group of Conservative Trade Unionistsâ€”
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0509">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
although that is a misnomer if ever I have heard oneâ€”will object to the danger of being dictated to on what the practice should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am prepared at the outset of this Committee to make the assumption that the Secretary of State and his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary are genuine in their desire to improve industrial relations and in their desire to devise a scheme which will have the agreement of the trade union movement. I think that they are starting from the wrong premise. Nevertheless, I accept that they are genuine in their desire to produce a scheme of this nature in the hope that it will improve industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a feelingâ€”I am sure that this will come out in the Committeeâ€”that the Government have been blinded somewhat by the apparent success of the BL ballot of workers on the BL plan. If that is what is blinding them at present, they had better have new thoughts on the subject. If they think that that is the example, I assure them that they will get into considerable trouble later on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that what Ministers are doing is trying to improve industrial relations and that they have put this scheme forward in good faith, but it is obviously the duty of the Opposition, particularly in a Committee where the Opposition can draw on an enormous amount of trade union experience in a wide variety of unions covering many industries and where there is so little experience on the Government side, to point out from our experience the dangerous area that the Minister is getting into.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether we shall conclude the debate on the amendment this morningâ€”it is in the lap of the gods at the momentâ€”but I hope that the Minister will give considerable thought to this matter, because the last thing I want is for the Committee to go through all its deliberations, eventually sending the Bill back to the Floor of the House, after which, presumably, some time in the late summer, it will be enacted, and for us then to find that the trade unions will not touch the scheme with a bargepole because of the dictatorial provision that the Secretary of State will lay down the regulations on ballots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister is aware that
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
ballots are held for the election of officers. That is a very simple thing. My own union, the AUEW, does it almost weekly. But how does one start to define what "officer" means and who will be involved in the election of officers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the example of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers, engineering section. The layman would assume that the seven-man national executive council, with a general president and a general secretary, all elected by the members, would be the guiding body of our great union. In fact, that is not the case. In the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers, engineering sectionâ€”I apologise for having to use the term "engineering section" but there are other sections within my union which do not have precisely the same set of rulesâ€”the policy-making body is the national committee, composed of 52 lay members who are elected by the divisions of the union. Each district is allowed to nominate to each division and then the division, based upon the district committees, then elects the member who will serve upon the national committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members on the Government side are probably confused and they will think in terms of the annual trade union conference at which 1,000 or 1,500 delegates get together by the seaside for a week and debate all sorts of aspects of union and national policy. That is not what I am referring to in the AUEW engineering section. Our national committee debates the issues which have been presented to it by the districts and it stays in session as long as is required until it has concluded the agenda. Once it has concluded the agenda and arrives at a policy, that policy is binding upon the elected executive council. So, there again, who would actually be the management body of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State would have to be prepared to consult the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers on the form of ballot which will be involved and to consult each individual union with regard to the regulations for ballot in those unions, which, obviously, will be a rather odd process. There are almost as many different methods of election in the unions in the TUC as there are unions in the TUC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One should recognise that this is a dangerous area. Regulations which may suit,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0510">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
for instance, the AUEW may not find favour with the Transport and General Workers' Union. If that situation were to develop, any such regulations could disturb industrial peace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is describing the difficulties which would arise vis-a-vis the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers. That is a one-industry union more or less, and its branches are homogeneousâ€”sometimes workplace branchesâ€”so that the ratio of officers to members is relatively small. With a general union, on the other hand, which spreads over many trades, a branch may incorporate groups of employees of a number of employers, so that there are group chairmen and secretaries, as well as branch officers. There can be a situation, as there is in my union, where a branch of 300 members may have 40 people acting as officers in one form or another. That will be a big bellyful of elections, will it not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and he emphasises the difference between unions. For instance, the AUEW is, generally speaking, a union based upon one industry. That is not quite trueâ€”we have other membersâ€”but, generally speaking, the scope of the AUEW is within the engineering industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) can give us the benefit of his knowledge of the problems which could ensue within the Transport and General Workers' Union. The problems outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) pale into insignificance compared with the problems in the T&GWU, which has trade groups within different industries. One could well foresee that a regulation drawn up to conduct ballots which would suit one trade group within the Transport and General Workers' Union might fall entirely foul of another group within the Transport and General Workers' Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the situation in the National Union of General and Municipal Workers, which has many members in the engineering industry working with my own union. It also has an awful lot of members within local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can easily see that it is not a simple matter to assume that the Secretary of
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
State can draw up a code of practice and make regulations which will cover the entire trade union movement. This is the great danger into which the Tory Party always slips. It will not make a study of the trade union movement. It will not consider the roots of the trade union movement. It will not consider how the various sectors of the trade union movement have grown up. It will not look at their histories and background. It assumes that it is one big, amorphous mass of people for whom one can legislate and then say that that is legislation for the trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who have worked in industry, who have served as shop stewards and convenors and chairmen of joint shop stewards' committees, are in an entirely different position. We have had to wrestle with the problems of the different rule books of the different unions, even within the same industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spent a great deal of my life in the shipbuilding and ship repairing industry, and I remember the situation in the 1950s, before the amalgamations took place involving the Boilermakers' Society. I am sure that that would repay study by the Minister. Let him study the difficulties the boilermakers had in bringing in the different sections of what is now the enlarged boilermakers' group from the old days when we had the boilermakers' union, which generally included platers and welders and burners, the shipwrights' union which brought in the steel men, the drillers' union, the blacksmiths' unionâ€”all separate unions in the days that I am talking about, all with separate rule books and separate methods of electing their people to office not only at the national level but at the regional, district and local levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one has had a lifetime wrestling with those different rule books, one fears for the sanity of the Secretary of State when he involves himself with what appears to be a very simple clauseâ€”
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by regulations make a scheme (below called "the scheme") providing for payments by the Certification Officer towards expenditure incurred by independent trade unions in respect of such ballots to which this section applies as may be prescribed by the scheme.'</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State is in for a great deal of trouble unless he thinks carefully about the road upon which he has embarked. It is a thorny road, and I suspect that unless he listens carefully to the words of wisdom which come from the Oppo-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0511">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
sitionâ€”obviously he can expect no help from the Benches behind himâ€”he will create great trouble. We are all in constant touch with the workers in our constituencies who make up the trade unions at branch and district level. They consult us constantly, and we are receiving a remarkable number of letters from individual trade unionists and district and area committees. All express fears about where the Bill, even unwittingly, may lead the trade unions and the Tory Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final remarkâ€”I am sure that it is echoed by all my right hon. and hon. Friendsâ€”is about confrontation between the trade union movement and the Government on such matters as the holding of ballots. There will be a lot of other things about which we shall have confrontation, involving grave major issues, and I do not want to go into those this morning. There will be plenty of time in the future to go into the state of various industries and the industrial relations which exist, or do not exist in many cases, in those industries. But I hope that the last thing the Government will want to create is a situation in which there is confrontation between the Government and the trade union movement about holding ballots. I am sure that the Minister will say something about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is dangerous for a Secretary of State to try to lay down regulations. I do not suggest for a moment that ACAS has all the received wisdom on the Subject. There may be other appropriate bodies, and the Minister may say that he will not only agree to consult ACAS but will agree to consult the TUC itself. I should have thought that that would probably be the most sensible thing to do, namely, to consult the TUC and to lay before Parliament only a scheme which had actually been agreed by the TUC general council. That would have been wiser, I suggest, than to draft the clause as it now stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no excuse for the words of the amendment not being in the Bill now, because soon after the election the Government put out a substantial consultation paper on the subject on which the Government proposed to legislate. In that respect, I should have hoped that, apart from getting two fingers from some trade unionists, the Government would have received a fair degree of reasoned thought from the TUC. I am sure of that. I hope that when the Secretary of State and the Minister
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
look at what has been said in the Committee today, they will recognise that, if there is to be any chance of success for this proposal calling for ballots on all issues, it is important that, if they do not accept the amendment, the Government should come back with words which will be of benefit to the trade union movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister appreciates that we have not accepted even the principle of the ballot system at this moment. It will be interesting to hear what the TUC says about the principle. But I am sure that there will be other amendments which will enable us to debate the issue of ballots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that my hon. Friends will add to my arguments and I hope that the Minister will think again. f the hon. and learned Gentleman cannot come to any agreement this morning, I hope that he will inform us that he is prepared to reconsider the matter and come back to it on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The idea of secret ballots to be carried out by the trade unions has become something of a fashionable theory in recent months. I suspect that the reason is that it is assumed that secret ballots will always produce the desired result, and the desired result in the view of most of those who passionately support this theory is that those people called euphemistically the moderates will always win.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that it will remain a fashionable theory until the inevitable happens, namely, that a ballot is held in which the wrong result is achieved. Then those who had previously been regarded as the moderates, that is, the "goodies", will suddenly become the "baddies", and those much-despised people, the trade union officials, will be regarded as men of moderation, decency and good will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the idea is to have any chance of success it is important that an element of impartiality should be instilled into it. That is why this modest amendment ought to be considered very carefully by the Under-Secretary. Whether he regards ACAS as necessarily the right and only body to consult, certainly he ought to consult some body which is known and regarded by the public as being impartial, and the advantage of ACAS is that it has that reputation among the trade union movement and, in so far as the public take an interest in these matters, among the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0512">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
public as well.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Chamber of the House only yesterday or the day before the Secretary of State for Industry, when questioned about the steel dispute, went out of his way to say that ACAS was an independent body, that he had no power to dictate to it, to advise it, to put pressure on it or to influence it in any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, if the Government are sincere in wanting to introduce more widely the concept of secret ballots among trade unions, and if they are providing public money to assist that process, it would help them in their endeavours, as well as helping the trade union movement, if the Secretary of State, who has power to make a scheme by regulation, were seen to consult a body which is not only experienced in these matters but also has that essential element of fairness and impartiality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot pretend to have the knowledge of the trade union movement at all of my hon. Friends have. It would not be accurate to say that the Bar Council was exactly clamouring to sponsor me any more than it is clamouring to sponsor the Under-Secretary. It may well be an idea that it should sponsor us both.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The worst closed shop in the business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But I know sufficient about the trade union movement to know that among certain sections of the trade union movement there is, if not a hostility, a suspicion about the Government's intentions. At a time when the Government are putting forward as their justification for introducing this clause a desire to improve industrial relations, a desire to reach out towards the trade union movement and to assure it that their intentions are good and honourable and decent, it would be an act of folly for the Minister to ignore an amendment of this sort, the intention of which is to do just that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister to consider the amendment very carefully. If he has reasons to believe that ACAS is not the appropriate body to consult he ought to come forward with proposals to show that he will consult some other impartial body, that it will not just be left to the whim of the Secretary of State as to where and
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
when to bring about such a scheme. In doing so, he will considerably add to the possibilities of what I introduced in the beginning as a fashionable theory, making it not just fashionable but also workable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although, no doubt, the Government are glowing with a sense of righteousness about this unparalleled act of generosity, they cannot really be surprised that there is a fair amount of suspicion on the part of the trade union movement about what appears, on the face of it, to be a very straightforward offer of money. There has never been a time, that I can recall at least, when any Conservative Government have really offered anything very much to the trade unions unless there was something more to it than met the eye.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Beware of the Greeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, the trade unions tend to beware of Conservatives bearing gifts. So I say that they must not be surprised that on behalf of our colleagues in the movement, we are looking at this very carefully indeed. I happen to be a member of two trade unions which vary considerably in their internal organisation. Both of them in different ways point to difficulties which I can see in the operation of this proposal. On the one hand I am a member of the Transport and General Workers' Union which, because of the enormous range of occupations which it represents, necessarily has a rather complex structure of management. The first question which I should like to ask the Minister is what is meant by subsection 3 (b),
	<br><blockquote><p>"electing a person to the committee of management of a trade union"</p></blockquote>
For example, within the Transport and General Workers Union a good deal of the management is carried on at regional level. We have elected regional committees as well as the general executive committee. The clause says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"to the committee of management of a trade union"</p></blockquote>
which suggests that a trade union can only have one committee of management. In the case of the Transport and General Workers Union would the regional committees qualify? Would people elected there be regarded as being elected to a committee of management? It certainly is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0513">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
not explained in the explanatory notes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again in the National Union of Journalists, of which I was a branch secretary for over 20 years before I came here, there are industrial councils representing the provincial and national press, radio and television and so on. Under decisions of the annual conference, these councils, which are not themselves the national executive, have certain executive powers. Again it is quite unclear from the way that the Bill is drafted whether bodies of that kind are regarded as committees of management or not. These are things which the Minister needs to explain and on which an experienced body like ACAS could no doubt give the Minister very useful advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back now to the question of suspicion, which the Minister no doubt thinks quite unjustified. Looking at it against the background of recent history, what kind of pressure, subtle or unsubtle, will be exerted on trade unions to take advantage of the money which is being put on offer? Can he assure us that no kind of pressure will be exerted? Can he tell us that in no circumstances will any hint be dropped to a trade union that it would really be a very good thing to come and grab the money which is being so temptingly offered? Is it not in fact a clear attempt to influence the decisions of a trade union by offering it a kind of bribe? Is it perhaps something even worse than this? Is it really sugaring a pill which has not yet been brought to light? Is it a way of smoothing the path towards later legislation which will make ballots compulsory? That is a very deeply held suspicion among my trade union colleagues. It may be that the Conservative Party learnt the lesson when it tried this kind of thing before and got a lot of egg on its face from the railwaymen. Possibly it will have more sense than to try it again, but history does not reassure me on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter which ought to be explained in some detail by the Minister is exactly what he means by
	<br><blockquote><p>"a reasonable amount of explanatory literature",</p></blockquote>
the expense of which is intended to be covered by this provision. Would this literature represent both sides of an argument which is the subject of a ballot? If there is to be a ballot, for example, on strike action, would it present the case for the strike and the case against it? Or is it intended only to cover the official literature put out by the executive of the union,
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
which probably is recommending one way or the other? Very rarely does a ballot take place without the executive making a positive recommendation one way or the other. Does this provision cover the cost of literature putting the other side of the argument? It is unclear. These are matters which will need to be settled very clearly by the Minister when he comes to reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All these, I am sure, are matters on which the advice and help of an experienced and independent body like ACAS would be absolutely invaluable, and these amendments are extremely sensible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Giles Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I declare my interest straightaway by saying, first, that I am a sponsored member of the General and Municipal Workers Union. I also wish to say that I am generally in favour of the idea of ballots, and of encouraging them. I hope, however, that the Government realise, as my hon. Friends have already pointed out, that they are no panacea. They do not necessarily produce the results that perhaps the Government might like. Sometimes, in fact, they lead to a hardening of attitudes. I hope they realise that. Certainly, from the kind of speeches that we heard at the general election, it was not always apparent that the Conservatives understood that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment should be accepted because it is essential that there should be consultation with ACAS. The details of balloting, and the kind of ballots that will be used, are unclear. The Bill is unclear on the kind of ballots it is referring to, and about whether the scheme will apply only to postal ballots, or whether they will apply to work place ballots. It is not clear what conditions unions will need to fulfil to be eligible or what types of expense will be covered. For example, will postage and administrative expenses be covered? There is the question of whether, for example, in the case of elections, the cost of supplying an election address will be covered by the scheme. In the case of work place ballots, will expenses be worked out where the employer has provided facilities for the conduct of a ballotâ€”and so on? The Bill does not say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is that ballots vary from union to union. Some unions have elections for officials, and some have postal ballots. The Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunication and Plumbing Union and the Amalgamated Union of Engineering
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0514">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
Workers have postal ballots. Others, such as the National Union of Mineworkers, of which my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) is a very distinguished member, go in for ballots at the work place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are all these differences in practice. Then, with ballots on disputes, again union rule books vary considerably. When one talks about the Transport and General Workers' Union, or my own union, the General and Municipal Workers Union, or about the AUEW, again there is a considerable variation of practice. That is another reason why consultation is needed. Frankly, I do not think that the Secretary of State is an expert on all these matters. With the best will in the world, and much as I admire him in some ways, I do not think that this is his forte. That is the reason why ACAS has an important role to play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will not question the authoritative role of ACAS, because clearly it is now backed by both sides of industry. Maybe there are one or two exceptions from time to time over certain matters but this is a body of great authority and one has only to look at members of the council to see that they are very important members on the trade union side and in industry as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point about ACAS is that it has built up very considerable experience in precisely this field of industrial relations matters. As hon. Members know, ACAS has the general duty to improve industrial relations and to encourage the extension and reform of collective bargaining. Let us just look at its authority and kind of experience it has built up. For example, on collective conciliation it dealt in 1978 with over 300,000 requests, and nearly 2,000 of those were completed on collective conciliation. It dealt with 421 cases on arbitration. This gives some idea of the way it has come to be supported and of the experience it has built up in industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has dealt with 45,000 individual complaints of breaking employment legislation, 87 per cent. of these relating to unfair dismissals. Trade union recognition is another aspect. I know that Conservative Members have views on that, but it dealt with over 200 such cases last year. Perhaps the most
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
important part of the work of ACAS in some ways is the advisory work it does on industrial relations generally. This shows the experience it has built up in this field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It did 365 surveys last year and it paid over 10,000 advisory visits. That shows that it is accepted by both sides of industryâ€”trade unions and management. This is a body with great experience and great authority within industry. If one talks about codes and advice on industrial relations matters, again it has experience, not only of codes on industrial relations generally, but its code on information for collective bargaining is a Very useful document. Its code on time off for trade union duties is an extremely useful document which is used throughout industry and the trade union movement. It is a body of great experience and authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are not matters that should rest with the Secretary of State, because the whole trend and drift of industrial relations policy has been to devolve these industrial questions to ACAS. There is general agreement on both sides of industry that this is a good thing. One takes matters away from Whitehall and one puts them where there are experienced people dealing with them. If one is to obtain acceptance of a general rule on balloting, one must have decentralisation and ACAS involved in the way in which this amendment seeks. I think it would be an extremely retrograde step if we push all the responsibility back to the Secretary of State who, as I said before with all respect which I have for him, does not know about these matters. It is an ACAS matter and therefore I support the amendment very strongly and I hope the Minister will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to underline one or two of the points made by my hon. and right hon. Friends, and to direct one or two specific questions to the Under-Secretary. In doing so it is necessary for me to repeat what has already been said by several of my hon. Friends, to put this particular clause and this amendment within the context of the Bill as a whole and to make it clear that we view this clause not with hostility but with suspicion, because of the whole context in which it appears in the Bill. As my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) said we are anxious that this appears to be simply the sugar on the very bitter pill that the trade unions believe they are being asked
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0515">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
to swallow. Since, on the face of it, some clauses, and this clause in particular, have presumably been put in at an early stage to pre-sugar the pill, we shall inevitably have to probe more deeply than we might otherwise have done into some of the seemingly innocuous aspects of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pick up first the question of cost which has featured largely in our discussions this morning. My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) referred to the vast amount of money which the Government are generously putting on offer. I question whether, when times are hard, this is the most appropriate use of taxpayers' money, giving it away when it has not been sought. So far as I am aware, there is no demand from anywhere, certainly not from any trade union, for these funds. Although some may accept and use funds that are made available, that is a different matter. They have not actually asked for them at any stage. Indeed, the general view is that this is not a desirable development. The unions perhaps with some exceptions, do not want such payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether the Government are actually encouraging the use of the funds in this way. In this respect, most of us share the view that we want to encourage secret ballots where necessary. As a number of my hon. Friends have pointed out, the trade union movement has a history of secret balloting, and in the Labour movement we have a history of ballots. Some of us may think that on some occasions we have balloted a bit too often. We are going through agonising discussions on these matters now. But at least we have such discussions. The Conservative Party does not seem to do so. At any rate, we do not think that we need any lessons from the Government on the question of balloting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are serious about encouraging the use of ballots, will Â£2 million be enough? If this offer is picked up widely, as the Government hope, I find it difficult to believe that they are not drawing an arbitrary line in fixing that figure. I press the hon. and learned Gentleman to give us the arithmetic by which he arrived at the Â£2 million. I have done calculations of my own, but I shall not weary the Minister with them now although I might want to weary him with them if I am not satisfied with his response.
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
I find it difficult to reconcile the figure of Â£2 million with any sort of widespread take-up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking, incidentally, about the Â£2 million figure, not about the initial take-up. The Minister has, understandably, put that at a lower figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I apologise for interrupting the hon. Member, but I suggest that it would be more appropriate to discuss matters concerning the sum of money involved during the debate on clause stand part, unless it is anticipated by hon. Members that we shall not have one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, Mr. Goodhew, but as this issue had been raised by a number of my hon. Friends I thought that it might be appropriate to raise it now. Naturally, I bow to your decision, unless the Minister chooses to respond quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A question has been raised concerning work-place ballots and whether these would be eligible for funds. There seems to be a misunderstanding here. I have here the document issued by the TUC only yesterday after its conference of national union officers. There were 220 officers from 73 unions at Congress House. This document was issued, and the comment on clause 1 is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The scheme will apply to a wider range of ballots than was envisaged by the original working paper, which was concerned mainly with the calling of strikes and certain elections and with postal ballots. Workplace secret ballots will qualify as well as postal ballots, subject to any requirements as to the level of secrecy specified in a statutory instrument. The extension of the scheme to cover ballots on amalgamations is a particularly important addition to the scope of the scheme and is clearly intended as the 'carrot' to the trade union Movement to gain acceptance."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That still leaves one hiatus, does it not, namely, ballots of the branch?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. I intended to say rather more about these aspects when we came to the next batch of amendments, but because the subject of work-place ballots had been specifically raised I thought it appropriate to mention here what seems to me to be a discrepancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The TUC's understanding, which, presumably, reflects the consultations it has had with the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State, in its latest consult-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0516">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
ations in particular, is that work-place secret ballots will qualify as well as postal ballots. The notes on clauses which the hon. and learned Gentleman has helpfully supplied us with say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The clause does not refer to 'postal' ballots but the Government intend that the regulations will provide only for this type of ballot to be covered initially with power to bring in non-postal ballots later."</p></blockquote>
Will the Under-Secretary clarify this? It seems to me that perhaps the TUC has a genuine misunderstanding of the position. We should be clear about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman kindly ask his friends in the TUC, if he has any influence with them, whether they could make available that red-covered document to Members on the Government side of the Committee? I am sure that we would benefit from their advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure we can do that, though, obviously, their response will be a matter for them. The document reached us on the Opposition side only this morning, so it may be, if the hon. Gentleman has not looked at his post, that he even has it. But we shall certainly consider that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At a price of 30p.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is great merit in the Government giving careful consideration to the amendment and to the views, in particular, of my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker). He said that it would not be in order to say much about the steel strike. I hope, Mr. Goodhew, that you will find it in order if I make a passing reference to it, because there is a relevance. At the moment, ACAS is directly involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought it might have been out of order only in the context of the amendment that I was moving. I hope that neither you, Mr. Goodhew, nor other members of the Committee will assume that we shall not seek to allude to it when we have, as is inevitable, further discussion about the role of ACAS, since it illustrates precisely some of our thinking at the time ACAS was conceived.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the right hon. Gentleman that the Chair would not rule
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
out of order any allusions to it which were relevant to the amendment or clause under discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to ensure that my remarks are in order in that respect and, in any event, I want to be brief on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
ACAS is engaged in the present difficult and delicate discussions on the steel industry dispute, and it seems to me that the Government have to some extent undermined the role of ACAS anyway because, if Mr. Mortimer and his colleagues at ACAS can conjure a settlement out of the present situation, given the straitjacket that they have been placed in by the Government, it will be an act of incredible ingenuity on their part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accuse the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State for Employment, of conniving in that way, but I think he has problems with his colleagues. f the Government are minded to undermine the role of ACAS in this wayâ€”I think that that is what is happening in the present situationâ€”it will be no bad thing, if for no other reason, although we have had a lot of other good reasons, if ACAS is given a vote of confidence in the Committee this morning and the amendment was accepted. As my hon. Friends have said, ACAS has great expertise, great knowledge, great depth of understanding of industrial relationsâ€”more so than any other single body we can think of.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to take up one point made by a couple of hon. Members on the Opposition side with regard to the making of consultation with ACAS mandatory. This would be entirely wrong, as I am sure my hon. and learned Friend will agree, because ACAS must be a neutral party in all these matters, and to make it mandatory to go to somebody who does not have an entirely neutral remit at least on one matter, namely, trade union recognition, which is still to remain enshrined in section 1(2) of the 1975 Act. I believe, especially if the Committee were misguidedly to accept amendment No. 4 or No. 5, that these could well be a ballot on the subject of recognition. If the Minister had to go madatorily to ACAS to seek guidance about a ballot, I think that he would be going to a party which was not entirely neutral.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0517">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, having said that, I accept the view of those who say that ACAS does an excellent job in terms of arbitration and conciliation and is genuinely objective about that. I should have thought that with its experience it would be perfectly reasonable to expect it to be consulted in the normal course of events by the Secretary of State on these matters. It is entirely another matter to require him statutorily to go to a body which is not entirely neutral, however.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In what sense does the hon. Gentleman say that ACAS is not neutral? In one sense it is not neutral because Parliament has given it certain obligations. I was talking about those earlier. It is therefore no criticism of ACAS to say that it is carrying out those obligations, but I do not see how consulting ACAS takes away its neutrality. I should have thought that that was something which both sides of industry would think was good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member must be well aware that its remit is itself a matter of controversy and has brought ACAS into the centre of controversy. It has been a matter of controversy in many fields, apart from the one referred to. I think that it is therefore reasonable that it should be kept at arm's length, rather than be the subject of a statutory requirement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that independence is not necessarily neutrality, and certainly ACAS has been involved in a controversial way in controversial matters. I think that that is inescapable, given the controversial nature of many industrial relations problems. However, we are careful about making comments about the judiciary, but many judicial figures find themselves involved in controversies and make controversial decisions. I sometimes have doubts about their neutrality, but I doubt if the hon. Gentleman would say that High Court judges were other than neutral, even though they get themselves involved in controversy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman seems to question the independence of ACAS, but I cannot think of any other body that has its independence written down in statute in
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
such an absolute way. We constructed it in that way in response to demands from the Opposition as the Conservatives then were, when the Employment Protection Act was in Standing Committee. Schedule I of the Act says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The functions of the Service and of its officers and servants shall be performed on behalf of the Crown, but, subject to paragraph 35 below,"â€”</p></blockquote>
which is the obligation on the Secretary of State to provide their pay and rationsâ€”
	<br><blockquote><p>"the service shall not be subject to directions of any kind from any Minister of the Crown as to the manner in which it is to exercise any of its functions under any enactment."</p></blockquote>
I cannot think of any way in which one could more categorically establish the independence of an organisation. May I also ask the hon. Gentleman, in the light of what he said, if we can expect from him an amendment to clause 2? It provides for codes, prepared by the Secretary of State which may beâ€”as we can now see, we shall be returning to thisâ€”on ballots on virtually any subject within the ambit of the Bill, and in it the Government are imposing, the mandatory obligation to consult ACASâ€”a proposal which the hon. Gentleman is saying is wrong in the context of clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was only in the interests of brevity and not wishing to impose myself too much on the Committee that I did not refer to that aspect originally. I was tempted to ask the Under-Secretary why he thought it right that there should be a mandatory obligation to consult ACAS on codes, the contents of which are not revealed but not on a specific matter like this. That is a contradiction to which the hon. and learned Gentleman must address himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very glad to respond to the hon. Member by putting a question to him. If he is so convinced of the neutrality and objectivity and independence of ACAS, perhaps he will very kindly give support to an amendment which I should like to see the Committee make, namely to remove the remit from ACAS to pursue collective bargaining as part of its requirement under the statute.Then I should be very happy to support all the other matters which he has mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am looking forward to debating precisely that area when we come to clause 2. The hon. Gentleman may well have noticed that in fact we have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0518">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
an amendment which relates to the specific and precise point to which he has alluded and I look forward very much to his contributions to the debate on that amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the way in which right hon. and hon. Gentlemen have addressed their arguments in this debate. It has been a useful opening, and one which has set a hopeful tone for future proceedings. Many of us over the past few years have sat opposite or beside one another on measures connected with industrial relations, whether the Bill of the hon. Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Radice), other Private Members' Bills, the Employment Protection Bill or others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is encouraging that we should have embarked in these proceedings on a clause which is in principle generally welcomed. I say that it is in principle generally welcomed, although I perfectly well understand the suspicions which right hon. and hon. Gentlemen on the Labour benches have felt necessary to voice, because I believe that most people who believe in democracy think that it is desirable that as wide and accurate a sampling of opinion as possible in the electorate should take place. Nothing that I say in advising my hon. Friends to resist these two amendments is intended to denigrate in any way the activities or integrity of ACAS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the amendment is of course to require the Secretary of State to consult ACAS in the two functions to which the amendments relate. The first is in the making of the scheme and the second is in adding to the purposes which are set out in subsection (3).As the right hon. Gentleman said when he opened the debate and moved the amendment, ACAS does not have a monopoly of experience in these matters. It would be the first to acknowledge the truth of that. I can at once say that of course it is the intention of the Secretary of State to consult ACAS in each of the functions that the clause seeks to impose upon him; but not only ACAS, for the Very reason that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned. It is equally his intention to consult the TUC, the CBI and any other bodies which have the very necessary experience which is required before a right and properly balanced judgment in these matters can be formed. I entirely agree that there are matters here which call for wide experience. Nobody supposes that
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
the trade union movement is a homogeneous body. We all know that each union has its different history, customs and practice and different arrangements. That is why not narrow but wide consultation is needed. The problem which is involved in accepting the amendment is that it singles out ACAS for this statutory duty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely there is a distinction to be drawn between on the one hand the bodies that the Minister has mentioned and obviously in particular the TUC, and these are important bodies with a wealth of experience in the matter. Clearly, any Secretary of State who has a head on his shoulders will want to consult the trade unions. There is a distinction, however, to be drawn between them and ACAS. ACAS, though an independent body, is an official body, and that is why my right hon. and hon. Friends have put down this amendment. The Under-Secretary ought to address himself to that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it is a legitimate distinction, but again, ACAS is not the only totally independent body with which it would be appropriate for the Secretary of State to hold discussions when he is considering how to implement, and exercise the powers that clause I will confer upon him. The certification officer is, of course, entirely independent, and since the certification officer will have the duty of satisfying himself that the conditions laid down in the regulations are complied with before he reimburses the union for the expenses, it would be entirely proper for the Secretary of State to consult him. Therefore, we see dangers in specifying this one body that the Secretary of State should consult. That is our principal reason for resisting the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been asked a number of questions and I want to do my best to answer them within the rules of order without taking up too much of the Committee's time. I will try to take them, for convenience, in more or less the order in which they were asked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) began by asking how widely the funds will be available. Subsection (3) sets out the purpose for which reimbursement can be made, for which ballots eligible for reimbursement can be taken They are fairly specific, but the important point is that the clause provides for regulations to be made by the Secretary of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0519">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
State which will describe and comprise the scheme. The Secretary of State is not obliged, of course, to draw up a scheme that comprises all of the purposes set out in subsection (3), nor all of the respects in which any single purpose set out in subsection (3) can be implemented. It will thus be a matter for the regulations, that the Secretary of State intends to make, but not before the consultation has taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the intention is that the costs shall be limited to postal ballots and their expenses, and not of a work place ballot. That is indicated in the explanatory note. That is the present intention. There is nothing in the clause that would preclude the Secretary of State at a later date, if he were so advised, from widening the provisions to cover a work place ballot. As the hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) mentioned, we are entering uncharted waters, for that reason we think it right to begin in a modest and limited way, and see how we get on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must ask the Minister to urge his right hon. Friend to think carefully about the inevitable inequities that will arise from a scheme that follows the line that the hon. and learned Gentleman has suggested. I am hesitant to trespass on the territory with which my hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) is much more familiar than I, but one instant example is the way in which officials of the National Union of Mineworkers are elected. They are elected by a work place ballotâ€”a pit-head ballotâ€”where the ballot papers are put in the box under the supervision of the Electoral Reform Society, an excellent, widely respected independent body. I ought to make it clear, in case there is any misunderstanding that, I am a sponsored member of the engineering section of the AUEW. As my hon. Friend the Member for Newton reminded the Committee this morning, we have ballots about almost everything in sight, and we have postal ballots for the election of our officials. I understand the hon. and learned Gentleman to be saying that when the Bill is enacted, and the scheme having been approved by the House becomes operative, my trade union will be able to go along to the certification officer with an open palm, and probably get some cash to defray the cost of the election of its officers. In the
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
case of the National Union of Mineworkers, which I do not believe is any less democratic in its electoral procedures, presumably, in the light of what the hon. and learned Gentleman has said, it will not be eligible for money. That is a thoroughly inequitable approach to these matters, particularly in the use of public funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge that here will be distinctions, but whether they are iniquitous is a different matter. The expenses of running a work place ballot are very much less than the expenses of running a postal ballot, but, as we all know, there are unionsâ€”and, in some cases, very substantial unionsâ€”that already have postal ballots. We shall have to see how we get on, but for the reasons I have indicated we intend to start in this limited way. If there is a break-up, then we shall see what the expense is and we shall try to learn, not only from consultation in advance but from experience of the scheme as it starts to be operated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me to the questions about the cost of the scheme, and I bear in mind, Mr. Goodhew, your injunction about trespassing on the clause stand part debate. Since I have been asked, may I answer in a very curtailed way by saying that we have taken the advice of the very body to which the right hon. Gentleman has paid such well-deserved tribute, the Electoral Reform Society. We have asked it for its views on the likely costs of postal ballots and our estimate, which is necessarily a very wide one and possibly more of a guesstimate than anything else, is based in part upon its advice in that regard. We have also taken estimates of the Various other costs that are likely to be generated under the purposes set out in subsection (3) and we have come to that conclusion. But, again, it has to depend upon the take-up and if we find that it is more than we anticipate then we shall acknowledge that we have been wrong, but we shall be rather glad to acknowledge that case because it will show that there is a need for the provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Under-Secretary would prefer to deal with this matter on clause stand part, I should be quite happy, but I asked him for the arithmetic. It may just be that he does not have the figures to hand but surely he could give us the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0520">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
cost per thousand votes that he estimates will be incurred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I think that that would be more appropriate on clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I bow to your ruling, Mr. Goodhew. The hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) expressed the fear that we were to have some risk of confrontation with the unions over providing funds for ballots. There are, I know, some people for whom every path is beset by tigers, but it seems a very alarmist View of a clause the sole purpose of which is to provide funds for those unions that may wish to have ballots for any of the prescribed purposes. It seems an unduly alarmist view that this will result in confrontation and one which we would certainly wish to avoid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Minister is passing rather too glibly over this aspect. I accept it is not a situation which will arise daily or even weekly, but because there is such a wide area of electing or voting for positions and people within trade unions there is a possibility of conflict.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the Minister will recall that we have been round this course before on previous Acts. May I quote the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers? As he is well aware, some five or six years ago we introduced postal ballots, but he will also recall that there was tremendous controversy within the union itself on their introduction. Apart from the propaganda which came out of the Tory party, the real reason for the controversy was that those who believed in members participating in the activities of the trade union pointed out that if ballots were held at the trade union branch at least it then encouraged members to come along and vote at the trade union branch and participate in all the other affairs of the union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure the Minister is well aware that ballots are not the only aspect of trade union life and that using branch ballots would attract members to the branch who would then play their part in all the other activities of the trade union, whereas, as has happened, ballots have now removed the need for members to attend the branch and there is a danger that all the other affairs of the union will
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
be concentrated in one or two hands at the branch. I am sure the Minister will appreciate that this creates problems and sometimes trouble. It was in that fashion that I was addressing myself to the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member. I understand the point. It was one which was canvassed by Lord Donovan in his Royal Commission in I968, when he drew attention to the fact that the focus of union activity had really left the branch and gone to the work place but that none the less elections continued to take place at branch level. Lord Donovan said that one of the ways to alter that would be to resort to postal ballots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are all matters, it seems to me, that will be properly considered when we consult over the regulations, but I thought it fair to tell the Committee that our present thinking is that this provision should be limited in practice at this Stage to the costs of postal ballots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman properly, and helpfully, drew attention to the situation of unions that cover more than one industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister happy that, if he restricts the scheme solely to postal balloting, he will be excluding a number of unions? Will he accept that there are other forms of voting and balloting which are equally Valid and genuine? When we have a general election, for example, we do not carry it out by postal ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My union uses a procedure similar to that used in general elections. We have ballot boxes at the places of work. We have elected scrutineers whose job is to see that everybody receives a ballot paper. The ballot is open for a certain period; the ballot boxes are then Sealed and taken to the union offices where selected scrutineers count the votes, very much in the same way as in general elections. It is not a postal ballot. Is the Minister happy that a union such as mine will be excluded from his Scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I beg hon. Members to bear in mind that if we cover too wide an area on this narrow amendment about ACAS, we shall be in the position where it is in doubt whether we shall have a debate on clause stand part. That is something I should not like to deny the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0521">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to reply to questions and at the same time to comply with your directions, Mr. Goodhew. It is a difficult task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the point made by the hon. Member for Newham North-East (Mr. Leighton), but the purpose of the clause is not to invent some goody and distribute it equally among everybody. The purpose is to encourage secret ballots. I accept that there are other valid methods of Voting which are equally useful, and if a union wishes to continue with such a method, well and good. It is no part of the Government's intention to encourage one rather than another method of secret balloting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to encourage secret ballots as a whole. If, for perfectly good reasons, a union wishes to continue with a method of secret balloting which is not a postal ballot, that will be a decision for that union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the point that some unions cover more than one industry. In the view of the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther), this would lead to many ballots, but the clause deals only with the election of a person to any post which he will hold as an employee of the union. That does not mean an official or officer of the union. An employee of the union is what is intended to be covered here. We shall be discussing this when we reach a later amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friends and I would be grateful if the Minister would enlarge a little on the point that he has just made. To us, it is extremely difficult to distinguish between an officer and an employee since officers clearly are employees of the union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister must not be too tempted, because we have a group of amendments dealing with that topic to which we shall come shortly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was next asked by the hon. Member for Rotherham what is meant by the committee of management. I was asked whether, in the case of the Transport and General Workers' Union, that would include regional management, that is, management at regional level, and in the case of the National Union of Journalists whether it would include industrial councils representing the provincial press.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
The advice is this. What is intended by the clause is the principal committee or the executive of the union and not other and subsidiary committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not say so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Should not the clause say so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that properly construed it does say so. That is the advice the Government receive. The reference to the "committee of management" means by implication, the principal committee of management. It is a matter which can be looked at, but that is the understanding of the Government on the advice they have received at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. and learned Gentleman be prepared to state categorically that the courts would put the same construction on these words?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Naturally, the Government do not put forward an understanding of the wording of the clause that is in conflict with what they think the courts will consider it to be. We do not do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next question I was asked, again by the hon. Member for Rotherham, was: what kind of pressure will be exerted on trade unions to take this up? The answer to that is simple and short, you will be glad to hear, Mr. Goodhewâ€”none whatsoever. Whether pressure will be exerted by their members to take it up is another matter. I must confess that I hope that their members will exert pressure on the committees and executives of their unions to take advantage of this provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next, I was asked what is meant by a reasonable amount of explanatory literature. That comes from the explanatory notes. I am glad they have been thought to be useful. This will be a matter for the discretion of the certification officer, who is completely independent. What is envisaged and hoped for by the Government, and we intend shall be eligible, is any relevant material of reasonable quantity which goes out in the same envelope as the ballot paper. It must be relevant to the question which the ballot is concerned with, it must be of reasonable quantity, and it shall be within the discretion of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0522">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
certification officer as to whether that shall or shall not qualify. These are matters which can be spelt out in much more detail in the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The most recent and publicised ballot was the one at British Leyland. I think that there was a letter from the chairman which went out with the ballot paper. Would Mr. Robinson's pamphlet have qualified to go out, with the use of taxpayers' money, under these arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not helpful for me to go further than I have already gone, save to say that the certification officer will doubtless look at the question with which the ballot is concerned. He will look at the literature which the union has sent out to its members and he will ask himself the question "Is this literature (	<i>a</i>) relevant to the question, and (b), is it reasonable in amount?" If the answers to both those questions are "Yes", no doubt he will wish to certify that it is eligible, and if to one or other or both the answer is "No", he will not'</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been going on at some length to assure us of the independence of the certification officer and the type of job that he would do. Am I right in assuming that the Secretary of State will appoint the certification officer, and has there not been a long record of doubt about the political integrity of those appointed by Secretaries of State over a wide variety of fields? In other words, is there not grave doubt about the certification officer being truly independent, and is there not even more doubt about his independence than there is about ACAS?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that for the hon. Gentleman everything must be beset by phantasms. I would never cast doubt upon the integrity of any official appointed by the previous Government whose function it was to exercise an impartial jurisdiction. I would never do so. I hope that the hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) is not casting any aspersion of that kind upon my right hon. Friend in respect of any person whom he has to appoint. In any event, the Secretary of State appoints a certification officer only after consultation with ACAS. Perhaps, if the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
Gentleman thinks that any reassurance is needed, he will draw comfort from that. I do not propose to take further time answering that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was then asked whether the Government were really serious and whether Â£2 million would be enough. I think that I have dealt sufficiently with that. I hope that I have conscientiously dealt with the issues that have been raised, and, in advising my hon. Friends to resist the amendment, I emphasise that I do so not for the reason that the Government cast any doubt upon the ability of ACAS to carry out its function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst), when he perfectly properly drew our attention to the fundamental purpose that ACAS has to observe in its terms of reference. He drew attention to circumstances in whichâ€”we know that this has been a matter of debate for over several years nowâ€”the ability of ACAS to steer a middle course has been called into question. I understand that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would only say to my hon. Friend that we do not believe that the same considerations arising out of the conflict that can be seen on occasion between the general and certain particular functions of ACAS can be seen in any way to devalue such advice as it might give on the matters arising under the clause. I repeat that my right hon. Friend certainly intends to consult ACAS, but not only ACAS, and it is because it is suggested that only ACAS should be consulted that I must advise my hon. Friends to Vote against the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee will be somewhat astonished by the Under-Secretary's reply. In effect, he says to the Committee is that it is perfectly all right to have consultations with ACAS and other bodies but he does not want a duty laid on the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that ACAS, in the vocabulary of some members of the Conservative Party, is a quango, and I dare say that some of the new Conservative Members, when they were fighting the election in May of last year, announced how they would get rid of some of these things. We have seen what has happened so far. But I know that the Under-Secretary would not share that View, and others of his hon Friends, with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0523">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
the probable exception of the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst), would not share that View, either. ACAS is a properly representative body, and, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) said in moving the amendment, it is highly respected and highly regarded. We would do well to listen to my right hon. Friend a great deal during the course of this debate because, for most of the past 12 years, he has been an employment Minister and he knows a great deal about these subjects. I know that he will be a tower of strength in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the independence of ACAS is now seriously questioned. Its reputation is very high. It is respected by both the CBI and the TUC. It jealously guards its independence. When the last Government, of which I was a member, had a Voluntary incomes policy, ACAS said that it would have nothing to do with any of the interpretation of that and would not try to enforce it but would maintain its independence completely. As my right hon. Friend and some of my hon. Friends said, it provides a good deal of free advice and deals with cases all the time. The point was made Very forcibly by my hon. Friend the Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Radice).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many problems will arise as a result of the Government's intentions on ballots. There is no doubt about that, and, of course, we shall want to return to the cost of these ballots, quite properly, either on later amendments or on clause stand part, because it is fundamental. Suffice it for me to say at the moment that we find it extraordinary that the Government are prepared to give money to finance ballots when the Chief Secretary to the Treasury is shooting his mouth off every weekend talking about hospital charges and the rest of it, only to be fired down by the Prime Minister when she comes round to the question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be many practical problems arising. I should have thought that, if a scheme was to be devised, since there is an independent body such as ACAS it ought to be consulted, and the Secretary of State ought to have duty placed on him to consult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I find astonishing in the Under-Secretary's reply is that the Government have not even asked ACAS, as far as I know, whether it would like this duty
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
placed on the Secretary of State. There is no reason why that consultation could not have taken place. The consultative documents came out in July of last year and the Bill was produced before Christmas, so there has been ample time for Under-Secretary of State and his right hon. Friend at least to find out from ACAS exactly how it felt on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not quite catch that intervention from the Under-Secretary, but perhaps he will tell us, because we cannot let this go by without the hon. and learned Gentleman having a further opportunity of reconsidering the Government's position on whether, during the past few months, they have consulted ACAS about its role in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I say, many practical problems can be cited. I am astonished that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Cadbury) has not taken part in this debate since he represents car workers in Long-bridge. One has only to look at the organization there to realise the difficulties which could arise as a result of ballots. Secret ballots have been held and we know that it is a multi-union concern. I think that that is the description of the place. Mr. Robinson is, I believe, the convenor of the combined shop stewards. There may, however, be a circumstance where one trade union, for example, within that plant wants to avail itself of the secret postal ballot and another trade union does not. A situation can be envisaged in which the AUEW, perhaps, would say that it would have a secret ballot and the Transport and General Workers' Union would say that it would have nothing to do with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How would the scheme apply to situations like that? Would it not be an extremely good thing for the Secretary of State, in trying to operate his scheme, and the certification officer in trying to adjudge whether it came within the framework of the scheme, to go to a body such as ACAS and ask how it would advise about it, how it would play it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That situation can be translated into many work places throughout Britain. In fact, it is quite the most common situation which exists. There are very few unions like mine, the National Union of Mineworkersâ€”an industrial union with about 95 per cent. of those engaged in the mines in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0524">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
one organisation. Most other employers have to deal with several trade unions, or in some cases with teams of trade unions. Therefore, I am sure that ACAS would have very good advice to offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not satisfactory to confine the scheme in the first instance to postal ballots and not to envisage at this stage work-place ballots. There is a common belief, certainly in the Conservative Partyâ€”I am sure that ACAS would have something to say about thisâ€”that if only one could have ballots one would get a better a result. "Moderation takes over", I think is the language used from time to time. It is not necessarily the case at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fact, if one wants to test that theory, it would be much better to start not with postal ballots but with work-place ballots. For example, the AUEW has a system of postal ballots now. It is true that in the election of officers and some of the other matters in which it invokes this system, there is a turnout of about 20 per cent. to 30 per cent. That is the sort of response to the ballot. That is an improvement, it will no doubt be said, on the branch meeting ballots, which, I think, get a response of only between 8 per cent. and 10 per cent. Even with postal ballots the response is not that good. On the other hand, in the National Union of Mineworkers, for example, in which there are secret workplace ballots, there is a turnout of some 70 per cent. or 80 per cent. Not only that, there is the single transferable Vote, proportional representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that ACAS would have some Views on the method of going about this. It is astonishing that by the method of work-place ballots and a response of some 70 per cent. to 80 per cent. the National Union of Mineworkers elected Communist general secretaries, Very distinguished people such as Arthur Horner and Will Paynter. The great ogre of the Conservative Party, Mr. Arthur Scargill, was elected by a 70 per cent. turnout in Yorkshire on a single transferable Vote. Nobody could question that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Conservative Party really believes that secret ballots are the best way of going about it, it had better see how it gets on and what kind of take-up of money there will be. The Government would do far better off by looking at the work-place secret ballot and asking ACAS for its View on that rather than by going straight
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
for postal ballots alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Under-Secretary will reconsider this matter. I hope that he will tell us whether there has been any consultation, formal or informal. I should not want to go into all the details if the discussions have been off the record, but I am sure that the Committee would like to know what consultation has taken place. Our attitude, quite frankly, could be influenced if the Under-Secretary could tell us, for example, that ACAS had been consulted in full council and had said "No", that it did not necessarily want the Secretary of State to have that duty placed on him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say only that our attitude could be influenced by that. So far, the hon. and learned Gentleman has not given any indication that such consultation has taken place. The independence of the members of ACAS is beyond question. We want to enhance the role of ACAS. That is our main purpose in seeking good industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly, over the next few months, and probably over the next few years, we shall have more industrial disputes. It is a common fact that industrial disputes occur more frequently with Conservative Governments than they do with Labour Governments. One only has to trace the record from I945 to know that in every year, roughly, there have been about 7 million days lost at work when a Conservative Government have been in office as opposed to about 5 million to 5Â½ million when the Labour Party has been in office. Of course, that will increase dramatically. So ACAS would certainly have views on the way this scheme should be conducted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has put a powerful case forward this morning to which, one hopes, the Minister has listened. Did my right hon. Friend note that the Minister stated on two or three occasions that ACAS was not the only independent body, whereas in fact the only one he cited as potentially another independent body was the certification officer, who, he admitted when questioned by me, is appointed by the Secretary of State? As the Minister has not been able to instance any other independent bodies, would my right hon. Friend care to address himself, out of his wide experience, to who might be the other potential independent bodiesâ€”the Church Commissioners or who?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are certainly lots of independent bodies whom the Secretary of State will probably wish to consult. I do not dispute that at all. It makes a good deal of sense on occasion for the Secretary of State to consult independent bodies. He would certainly consult the TUC, the CBI, chambers of commerce and many bodies like that. But we have ACAS and it is broadly acknowledged now as having independence. It has a great deal of experience, and the Secretary of State ought to have this duty placed on him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will reconsider his position and tell us particularly what discussions have taken place with ACAS about this clause. Let him tell us at least that he will think about it again, perhaps with a view to putting down an amendment when the Bill returns to the Floor of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended intervening in the debate, largely because I thought that my hon. Friends had marshalled all the arguments and all the questions that arise on the two amendments. I am, however, induced to get upâ€”I promise that it will not be for longâ€”by some observations of the Under-Secretary which deserve comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin by expressing my gratitude to the hon. and learned Gentleman for what he said about the effectiveness and independence of ACAS, and for performing the necessary task in so doing of exposing the nonsense of the rather pathetic vendetta pursued against ACAS by the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst). I was delighted when I discovered that the hon. Member for Hendon, North was to be on this Committee. I think that he has an important role on this Committeeâ€”the role that was fulfilled at Greek dinner-parties by the skeleton sitting at the table, the role of warning one of what can go wrong if one is not careful. The hon. Member, who, I suppose, has been responsible, in his own way, for as much ill feeling in industrial relations as anybody else in this country on either side of industry, will fulfill that death's-head function very well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What surprises me is that, on the one hand, we have the Under-Secretary paying his well deserved tribute to ACAS and, on the other, there is the whole thrust of several early clauses of the Bill. I must not
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
go too far into anything beyond the two amendments before us or I shall incur your displeasure, Mr. Goodhew, and you know that I should not want to do that, but the whole thrust of the early part of the Bill is to devalue ACASâ€”I do not say to denigrateâ€”by removing into the hands of the Government functions which we thought ACAS was designed to carry out, and some of which we know it does carry out extremely well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will want the scheme to be taken up when it is made. I am sure that the Department of Employment, if the Bill goes through and the clause in this form or any form near it goes through and the scheme is made, will watch closely the take-up of that scheme. It will judge, and will be right to judge, the success of this operation by whether there is a substantial take-up or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State wants to have a high take-up, he must devise a scheme which is acceptable. If he wants to devise a scheme which is acceptable, he ought to find out from people who know what sort of scheme is likely to be acceptable to those whom he wants to take up the scheme. He ought to be sounding out with great care. I was glad to hear the Under-Secretary say that it was the Secretary of State's intention to consult not only ACAS and the certification officer but the CBI, the TUC and the rest of them. All he did not want was to have his intention made overt in half a line in the Bill. That puzzles me Very much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With great respect to them both, the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary could have found out when they started their operations something which has been made evident by many of the speeches of my hon. Friends that the whole business of balloting is a great deal more complex, a great deal more involved, and a great deal more heterogeneous as between one trade and another and one union and another than they had thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My impression is that Ministers have not thought this matter through at all. They have got hold of what they thought was basically a good idea and they said "We shall go for it". They have not thought it through; nor have they, in order to give the subject proper thought, asked enough people what might be the likely consequences. The Government will run into many difficulties concerning definitions. It is all very well for the Under-Secretary to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0526">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
say "the committee of management" means the top committee of management and not any of the others. But I do not know which is the top committee of management of my own union. Is it the elected national executive committee or a lay body which is elected and which has total power to reverse the decisions of the national executive? In that case, which is the committee of management. The Minister will find all sorts of difficulties arising out of this matter. We have already heard a great deal about the different sorts of ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say at once that I share the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Chester-le-street (Mr. Radice). I am not against the clause in principle because I think it will do my union a lot of good, and I shall explain why. There will be a number of unions which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) said, will look with an eye that is jaundiced and suspicious at this gift being held out to them. They will be tempted to amend the classic phrase and say 	<i>"Timeo Toraos"</i> instead of 	<i>"Timeo Danaos"â€”"we</i> fear the Tories"â€”"Timeo 	<i>Toraos et dona ferentes."</i> I am not worried about that, because I can tell the hon. and learned Gentleman exactly what will happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that the object is to encourage people to have secret ballots. I give him a guarantee that there will not be one more secret ballot as a result of this clause than already takes place. The limitation on the number of secret ballots that take place is not a financial limitation. It is always a conscious decision on the part of union executives whether a certain posting shall be done in this way or not done in this way. I know of no case throughout the trade union movementâ€”and I have been in the movement a long timeâ€”in which an executive said "It would be nice to have a secret ballot" on a particular issue "but we cannot afford it, we do not have the money."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the hon. and learned Gentleman what will happen. All those unions that already use ballots, and there are many which have many ballots which fall within the ambit of this clause, as we have heard, will go to the Minister and say "Give us the lolly". I know mine will. So the Minister will be paying for the fulfilment of a function which was fulfilled anyway without his money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
I shall be delighted, because that means that the amount of money which formerly had been spent by my union can now be devoted to other purposes, such as giving better services to members or providing a bit more strike pay. That would allow some of our members to be more militant about taking industrial action than they otherwise would. This will be a blessing in disguise so far as I am concerned. Whether Conservative Members, realising that the effect of clause I will be to make more money available for strike pay, will think so is another matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole matter requires to be looked at more carefully, and in the course of looking at it more carefully one needs to take advice. I found it difficult to follow the Under-Secretary's argument. He said that, of course, the Government would take advice from ACAS but they do not want to be bound statutorily to do so. Of course, he said they will take advice from others as well and that it would be invidious or in some other way wrong to have the amendment which mentions ACAS without mentioning all the other bodies. I am quoting not his actual words, of course, but the import of what he was saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For goodness' sake, why? Is the Under-Secretary really saying that it is a logical position that unless we reel off the whole list of bodies we cannot include any? ACAS is 	<i>sui generis</i> That point has been made over and over again. It stands in a different relationship from the CBI and the TUC, of course, because they are both interested bodies, and it stands in a different relationship even from the certification officer and other public bodies because the area in which ballots will take place if they do not already take place or ballots will be paid for if they already take place is precisely the area which ACAS was set up to cover. It is 	<i>sui generis</i> It has a special, particular, discrete claim to be looked upon in this matter as the Government's natural, obvious and principal adviser, with not merely an ex-gratia right to be consulted but a real right to be consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the Under-Secretary worried about? The amendment asks only that he consult; it places no obligation on him to take any notice of what ACAS says. It places no obligation on him to do what it recommends or even to take a blind bit of notice of anything that it has said. So what is keeping him awake worrying at night
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0527">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
about putting into the Bill the obligation to consult ACAS?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman beganâ€”it was very kind of himâ€”by paying a tribute to the way we had started our debate. I hope that all our debates, however hard-hitting, will be mutually respectful, friendly and constructive. We have a job to do in the Committee and I hope we shall do it in the best possible way. In the course of that, we shall express some great differences of principle, shall bash away at each other, and in the end we shall decide by Vote. Why on earth does he want to have a controversy over a little thing like this?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to find out what grave disasters would be caused, how much extra overtime would have to be worked at the Department of Employment, how many resignations he would get from horrified officers at his Department appalled by his willingness to accept this tremendous amendment. What sort of disasters would there be, I ask him, if he accepted the amendment? We shall be fighting over things that matter. Why do we fight over a thing like this? I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman to think again about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a matter of courtesy, I should reply to the question I have been asked by the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) as to what consultation there has been with ACAS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since July the working papers were sent to ACAS, as well as a very large number of other bodies and individuals whom we thought it right to consult, and it will be within the right hon. Gentleman's recollection that they set out the present suggestion as to what the scheme should cover and also rehearsed the possibilities of postal ballots and of non-postal ballots. In July ACAS replied through its chairman that it did not wish to comment at that stage on any of those proposals but it wished to be kept in touch with the developing views of the Government on the proposals regarding codes of practice. That indicates that we did seek the views of and consult with ACAS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to what has been said, very entertainingly if I may say so, by the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo), our objection to this is that it would put an entirely misleading cast upon the wording of the clause and give rise to the suggestion, which others might wish to use at some
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
later stage, that it was only with ACAS that Parliament intended that the Secretary of State should consult. It is quite unnecessary, and I do not think that I shall assist the Committee by repeating the arguments which I advanced earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that we shall now have to proceed to a Division. When last evening, we discussed how we would conduct ourselves this morning, I said to my hon. Friends that I thought that after I had moved it the Under-Secretary would get up and instantly say "I readily accept this amendment on behalf of the Government." That was what I told my Friends. We never envisaged that we would spend the whole of this morning debating the matter. But, to my astonishment we have, and I am bound to say that the Under-Secretary's reply, which rests essentially on the point that if we specify ACAS, by implication we shall exclude others or not consult them is in contradiction to the provisions in the clause to which I have already referred and which we shall next be debating, where there is precisely such a mandatory obligation to consult ACAS in respect of codes as we are suggesting is relevant and right in the present case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I alluded right at the outset of my remarks to the fact that when we were dealing with the Employment Protection Bill in Standing Committee it was the then Oppositionâ€”now, the hon. and learned Gentleman and his hon. Friends in officeâ€”who then urged us not merely that ACAS should be consulted but that ACAS should be given the responsibility of drawing up a code of practice on ballots and subsequently supervising them: That is much further than we now wish to go. They went so far then that we had to resist their blandishments. Then they tried another tack when the Employment Bill came to Report and suggested that there should be an obligation to consult the TUC. If the hon. and learned Gentleman had suggested that to us this morning, we should have taken him seriously. But he has not suggested that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid that I shall have to urge my hon. Friends to do what I thought would be quite unnecessary, that is, to vote on the issue. But before I sit downâ€”I should never dream of trying to challenge the erudition which my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0528">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
(Mr. Mikardo) always brings to our proceedingsâ€”may I just say this? The word "Tory", apart from having a Latin origin, has its origin in an Irish Gaelic word used by the Irish bog-trotters and bandits who held up travellers saying 	<i>"Toiridhe, toiridhe"â€”Give,</i> giveâ€”and passed into popular parlance as a word describing an Irish bog-bandit.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of these points have been touched on during the previous debate, but I fear I shall have to go over part of the argument again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, may I try to anticipate, at least in part, the reply that we may receive from the Under-Secretary? One suspects, on the evidence of the preceding debate, that he will say to us, as he said then, that we have to learn from experience, that the Government will be making regulations to deal with these matters, putting forward a scheme after consultation and learning from experienceâ€”a phrase, I may say, which does not sit too happily with the Conservative Party because much of the burden of our argument as we go through the Bill will be that in so many of these matters they have failed to do precisely that. They have flouted their experience,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
	<p>have that on record.</p>
	<p>It has been a useful debate in so far as we have a number of matters now on record which will give us cause for reflection and perhaps stimulate further debate. I had thought that such further debate would have been unnecessary, but that is a matter for another day and other amendments. I can only urge my hon. Friends to show their displeasure with the Under-Secretary's reply by voting on the amendment before us.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:â€”</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided;</i> Ayes 9, Noes 12.</p>
	<p>particularly the experience which they had between 1971 and 1974.</p>
	<p>What worries me particularly about this clause and the suggestion that we should await regulations is, of course, that we know that in much legislation there is provisionâ€”I suppose that it could be called permissive by which, after an Act is passed, regulations may be made. But this is a special situation. We have heard already this morning of the grave suspicions within the trade union movement in particular, and this Committee, about the Government's intentions.</p>
	<p>Trade unionists are worried about this provision. They are worried that it may lead them down the road towards mandatory ballots. I know that the Under-Secretary will say that that is not to be the case. He has said that already, but it will not alter the fact that there is anxiety. We are being asked in this clause to buy what some of us would feel is a pig in a poke. We do not know what the regulations will say.</p>
	<p>I say again that some of the arguments which the hon. and learned Gentleman used earlier give us serious cause to doubt whether the Government have thought this thing through. I know that they will have consultation. That is one thing. But when one goes out to consult one should have a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0529">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
pretty clear idea of what one is consulting about. By the time one comes to the Committee on a Bill one should have a pretty clear idea in one's mind, to put it at its lowest, just what it is that one intends to propose. But on a number of these points, relating particularly to these two amendments, the Under-Secretary seemed to be in a state of considerable doubt.</p>
	<p>The first amendment deals with the word "employee". We suggest that "employee" is not sufficient and that it should be replaced by the term "office-holder".</p>
	<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman himself cast some doubt earlier on what was meant by the word "employee". Does it include officials or not? As I understood it, he was saying that it did not include officials of trade unions. That seemed an extraordinary definition, putting an incredible limitation on the way in which this whole scheme would operate.</p>
	<p>Are the Government satisfied that subsection (3)(	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) will cover every elected full-time officer? Or is it the intention, as the hon. Gentleman seemed to imply, that it will cover none of those people? I am quite confused now. I should have assumed that the aim was to cover all the elected full-time officers, but, again does that cover them at national or at regional or at local and district level, plus all the elected national office holders? For instance, are all those people elected to the committee of management covered? Is the hon. Gentleman sure that an elected lay president of a union will always be covered by these proposals? It is difficult to think of examples on at least one interpretation of the Bill where that would not be the case, but I am not sure. We need a clear explanation.</p>
	<p>I referred earlier to the TUC document about work-place secret ballots and whether they would qualify. The Under-Secretary replied, and it would seem from what is said in its document that the TUC has misunderstood the Government's intentions. I do not know whether the Under-Secretary can throw any light on why that should be. I imagine that he was with his right hon. Friend at the last round of discussions and consultations when they met the TUC committee. It would be
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
helpful if he could give us some indication as to what was said at that meeting and why the TUC has taken that view of this clause. There seems to be some confusion. I should appreciate it if he would clear that up, and it would be helpful if we knew how it arose.</p>
	<p>We are in a dilemma until we hear the Under-Secretary in some detail on these matters. As I say, we want to know whether the legislation is aimed at covering ballots for full-time employees of the union or the management committees. Does it cover, for instance, shop stewards' committees? It is difficult for us, on the basis of what we have seen before us, to work this out.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) has already mentioned the trade group structure, for instance, in the T&GWU. In the union which sponsors me, the EETPU, in addition to the national executive committee there are industry-based committees and there are elected shop stewards. I think I am right in recalling that the Under-Secretary has ruled out paying for ballots in those cases. He has talked about the principal body. Again, one of my hon. Friends asked "What is the principal body?"</p>
	<p>To take again the example of the AUEW, is the principal body the national executive committee or is it the policy-making national committee of 52 delegates? Would that committee be regarded as the principal body? It is, after all, the policy-making committee which really holds the power. The national executive committee is the interpreter of the decisions of the policy-making body. This goes for most of the trade unions with which we are concerned. With some of those trade unions, I realise that there is a dilemma for the Governmentâ€”</p>
