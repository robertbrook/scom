<p><i>Question proposed</i> [<i>this day</i>] That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned at lunchtime, I was addressing myself to the complaint that there was no evidence to show need for any change in the existing law's provisions regarding the giving of notice or the confirming of intention to come back to work, to exercise the reinstatement. rights. I had made a passing reference to the rather extensive evidence to which I had referred on Tuesday, and I was reading a letter which by chance came to my desk—sent to me by a colleague—which I thought bore directly upon the point. [<i>Interruption.</i>]I find it impossible, Mr. Leadbitter, to compete with the eagerness of the hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans). I was about to say that I have the authority of the hon. Member concerned to read the letter, but I have not been able to secure, or even to ask for, the authority of the letter's author, and therefore it would not be right for me to identify the school. However, I can say that the letter is from the headmaster of a comprehensive school in England.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Eton?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, another one—not quite so ancient a foundation, but another one. No doubt, the point could as well be made by the headmaster of Eton, but perhaps it will carry more weight coming from the headmaster of a more modern comprehensive school.<br><br>
May I remind the Committee of the point that I had reached? I had said that the author of the letter was complaining
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1206</span>
of the notice provisions and of the very wide gap between the preliminary notice and the ultimate notice which, under the existing law, need be given only a week before the date of intended return. This headmaster says that a woman in his school—I presume that she was a teacher—left for maternity leave. This is an important point so I think that I am justified in repeating it. She
<br><blockquote><p>"left for maternity leave on 28 September 1979, her confinement was (a fortnight late) on 31 December and the adjusted leave with protection does not expire until 21 July 1980. I am, by law, unable to advertise the vacancy for a permanent replacement until after 21 July since the law does not allow her to abdicate her rights.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"I am sure that you can see the implications for staffing in my school. Two years have to pass before the disruption caused by this event work themselves out of the system. I am unable to replace her adequately until 1 January 1980, and because I cannot advertise her replacement until September (effectively) I shall not be able to appoint until January 1981".</p></blockquote>
I think that he refers there to a permanent replacement.
<br><blockquote><p>"It is well known that good staff are rarely acquired in January. We are unlikely therefore to be properly suited until April 1981. Meanwhile, seven classes of 20–30 pupils have had a disastrous educational experience over two years.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"It does seem to me that the priorities have gone sadly astray."</p></blockquote>
Here, he expresses an opinion which is against my own:
<br><blockquote><p>"I should have thought three months following a confinement were sufficient for a mother to make a rational decision about whether she wished to return to work. Her position could still be protected for her for a further three months, but at least if she wished not to return to work she could indicate the fact and allow the school to do something constructive about the matter. This, at least, would confine the disruption to a more reasonable interval of time.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"This kind of obligation does not inspire anyone with the confidence to appoint young married women to positions of any status, let alone those of responsibility, when the whole edifice can collapse in this manner."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And he is a headmaster?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He is a headmaster.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Giles Radice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Which school?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is such a pity—I am always desolated when the hon. Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Radice) is not with us—but I have already explained that it is a comprehensive school—not Eton, but a newer comprehensive school—and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1150">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1207</span>
I regret that I do not have the authority to identify the author, because I have not yet asked for it, but I have the authority of the hon. Member who sent me the letter, which I received in the course of my duties in the Department of Employment, to use in Committee without the attribution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the sake of completeness, I shall finish the letter, and then I shall give way to everybody in sight to enable them to try to retrive something from the ruins.
<br><blockquote><p>"I am writing therefore to suggest that an amendment to the Bill is timely and wonder whether there is any chance that you might press the matter."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman, as a matter of urgency, obtain permission from the Member of Parliament concerned to disclose the name of the school? In view of the appalling contents of that letter, it is essential that some of us be given the opportunity to contact members of the staff of that school, particularly the female members of the staff, to get a view on the headmaster that we can read out to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is precisely because intimidatory remarks of that nature are now unknown to those who support hon. Gentlemen opposite that we have felt it necessary to introduce some of the other provisions of the Bill. I certainly will not in those circumstances seek to obtain the authority of anybody to disclose the identity of the school.[<i>Interruption.</i>] I hope, Mr. Leadbitter, that we are not about to spoil our enviable record in this Committee for dealing with each other in a civilised way, and that it is not suggested that I seek to mislead the Committee by reading a letter that is not genuine.<br><br>
We all know the rules of good manners in this place, and we do not indentify without permission the authors of documents that are sent to us as Members of Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to intervene in a civilised way. The hon and learned Gentleman has at last produced a letter from someone who appears to support
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1208</span>
this clause. If it was a village school headmaster with a staff of three, one could understand it, but we are told only that it is a comprehensive school—with, perhaps between 1,000 and 1,500 pupils. There would be a staff of 50, 60 or 70 teachers, so it should not be too difficult for that headmaster to make arrangements to replace a teacher who is away having a child. Would it not also be fair to canvass the women teachers for their view on this clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One can readily visualise the inconvenience that follows not only for the staff but for the pupils when a temporary replacement is taken on. One infers from the letter that it proves not to be satisfactory, and yet a permanent replacement cannot be engaged until the length of time described in this letter has elapsed, the reason being that the headmaster has to wait until the end of July 1980 before it becomes apparent that the lady is not proposing to return, contrary to the earlier indication that she had given.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman may now be regretting his commitment to give way to everyone in sight. Is it not clear that this headmaster is unaware of the normal system that operates within an education authority, namely, that in every authority there is a pool of people known as supply teachers who are available for posting to a school—not for a day or two but for longer—in order to fill a gap created in precisely those circumstances?<br><br>
It happens when people are taken ill, and not only for reasons of maternity. In such cases it has been the system for at least half a century that every authority has supply teachers to be posted in to fill those jobs. I cannot understand how a head teacher can write a letter in those terms if he is aware of the way in which the system operates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I dare say that we can give the head teacher credit for knowing that supply teachers are available. A supply teacher may not be capable of filling, with the same distinction, the post of a specialist teacher of considerable seniority who has taken maternity leave. It needs no effort of imagination to see that that is likely to be the case.<br><br>
I have been assailed for not producing evidence, when I have referred to inde-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1151">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1209</span>
pendent surveys, and producing the latest letter—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One letter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—the latest letter to come before me. I do not wish to suggest that the Opposition are interested only in the evidence that suits their case, but I am entitled to try to assist the Committee by pointing out the mischief that the present very wide gap between the dates of notice brings about. The letter refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"the confidence to appoint young married women to positions of any status".</p></blockquote>
It is because the Government wish that more young married women who wish to work are offered employment that we are introducing the reform contained in the clause. The reason for the comment made in this letter is that the woman had said, possibly 14 or 16 weeks before her confinement, that she was intending to come back. Yet it was not until 29 weeks after confinement that it was apparent that she was not to do so.<br><br>
The question for anyone who is anxious to get the right balance of the law must be: in what proportion of cases of those who take maternity leave does that occur? If it is just aberration, there is no need to change the law. But we must ask ourselves that question if we are to consider the matter seriously. Unfortunately, there are no national statistics of the proportion of those who take maternity leave who indicate in their preliminary notice that they will return and who ultimately do not do so.<br><br>
We are very fortunate in having the advantage of the independent surveys to which I referred on Tuesday. They were referred to in the EOC report, and that is their relevance. Hon. Gentlemen opposite seemed to indicate that there was no relevance, but it is to the proportion of cases in which that can be expected to occur.<br><br>
The survey of the Federation of Scottish Bank Employers showed that two out of three failed to return. That is 66 per cent. The Barclays Bank survey revealed that 85 per cent. of those who had said that they would return failed to do so. The <i>Industrial Relations Review and Report</i>showed that over in 7,000 of its subscriber organisations 75 per cent. failed to return when they had said that they would.<br><br>
Therefore, we may reasonably assume that that is the kind of proportion—60
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1210</span>
per cent. to 70 per cent. of cases—that we may expect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me just pursue this point because it is serious, to judge by the time taken on it. The nature of the mischief is evidenced by the letter that I have read. The scale of the mischief is indicated by the surveys to which I have just referred, which are considered sufficiently important to be reproduced by the Equal Opportunities Commission and by the Low Pay Unit.<br><br>
Therefore, to describe the policy of this clause as mean, petty, spiteful or despicable—</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a better word.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To describe it in any of those terms does not do justice to the argument. To dismiss the clause as being simply mean or petty is to fall short of the persuasive. It must be plain to anybody following the argument that the existing law, which permits so long an interval of silence, can be a significant disadvantage. It can be a disadvantage to the employer, and through the employer a disadvantage to women generally, because in practice, though we have the Act, women are very far from being assured of equal employment opportunities, unhappily. We can at least agree about that.<br><br>
The question has to be: must we continue with the law in this form, or can we improve it without injustice to women or harming their employment opportunities? The answer that the Government give is that we can improve it. We can provide for confirmation to be given a reasonable time after confinement, and we <i>say—pace</i>the Equal Opportunities Commission which said six or seven weeks as a minimum—not as a duty in every case but only if it is asked for in writing by the employer in response to a written request. If she confirms and later changes her mind, in practice absolutely nothing will happen to her—we all know that—though something will to her employer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Radice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely, that very point destroys the argument and learned Gentleman's argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said on Second Reading not that I expect anybody to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1152">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1211</span>
remember it—in response to those who made the point just made by the hon. Gentleman, that nobody will pay a blind bit of notice, that is to take a much lower view of human nature than I am prepared to accept. Most people receiving a request in these circumstances will do their best to answer honestly. There will be some who change their minds for perfectly good, not blameworthy, reasons and in practice nothing will happen to them.<br><br>
If a woman fails to respond to that request, her rights to reinstatement will fall away, but because I have accepted the amendment in principle that has been put forward helpfully, the request will have to set out the consequence of not responding, so there is no injustice there. If she says No, I shall not come back", her rights will fall away.<br><br>
But it must be significant that the Equal Opportunities Commission report contains a recommendation that the confirmation should be obtained after confinement and that six weeks is a reasonable period.<br><br>
The arguments that have been addressed at considerable length and with considerable passion to attacking the clause do not stand up to rational analysis. The principal of giving notice is conceded in the 1975 Act, and is continued in the 1978 Act, both Acts passed by the Labour Government.<br><br>
I could understand if right hon. and hon. Gentlemen were saying that nobody should be obliged to give notice and this is an infringement. But if the principle of requiring a woman to give notice in order to claim her rights has been conceded, surely the important thing is to see that that notice is given at sufficient intervals to ensure that the purpose of giving notice in the first place is achieved.<br><br>
The purpose and principle of the clause is to ensure that notices are effective to meet their purpose. Their purpose is to remove unnecessary obstacles in the path of employers to employing women who wish to work. If the notices are insufficiently effective under the present law, it is the duty of the Government to put that right. If we were to allow them to continue to be insufficient, that, indeed, would militate against the interests of women.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the whole, I like the hon. and learned Gentleman better when he is not whipping himself up into a lather of synthetic indignation. When he
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1212</span>
brings his normal calm, judicial mind to our proceedings he does better for us.<br><br>
The Minister's last few words were a repetition of something that I have heard him say more than once. His general thesis is "Let us not have the best possible conditions of work for women because that is not in their interests. If you insist on employers giving them decent conditions of work, employers will not employ women and they will be worse off."<br><br>
I beg the hon. and learned Gentleman to give a moment's thought to what would be the effect of carrying that argument to its logical conclusion. We could create a much greater demand for women's employment, and it would be, to quote his words " in their interests " if we insisted that no woman was to be paid more than a third of the proper rate for the job. There would be a great demand for women's work, and it would be "in the interests" of women. The demand would be buoyant.<br><br>
It just will not do to say "We really want to make life a bit harder for women and easier for employers, because then employers would employ more women and women will be better off." However much the hon. and learned Gentleman works himself up, he will not get away with that sort of specious argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee for long, but I must come back on the hon. and learned Gentleman's arguments. He produced three alleged pieces of evidence in his favour. The first—to which he has returned several times during our debate on the clause—is from the Equal Opportunities Commission. I conceded previously, and concede again, that there is one point in what it had to say which is in favour of his argument. But it is one point only, and I think that the commission was misled in offering him that hostage to fortune. It was at an early stage when it was talking about the consultative document and not about the Bill, and a good deal has changed since then.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman has sought to imply that in some way th Equal Opportunities Commission i broadly in favour of the clause. That i not so, and we must repeat that it is not.<br><br>
I quote briefly from the Equal Opportunities Commission's own newspaper. I may have quoted it before, but it has to be repeated in view of what the hon. and learned Gentleman has said:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1153">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1213</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission finds little or no evidence that employers, large or small, have faced significant problems in operating the maternity provisions of the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act and adds that it would be unwise as well as undesirable to propose or embark on substantive changes in the rights of working women and women intending to return to work in the absence of convincing evidence."</p></blockquote>
That sums up the Equal Opportunities Commission's overall view of the situation and the clause, and I do not think it in any way unfair of us to suggest that the Equal Opportunities Commission would—I should think unanimously—want us to oppose this clause standing part of the Bill.<br><br>
The second piece of evidence which the hon. and learned Gentleman produced was that curious letter from an unnamed headmaster. One understands that he has had difficulty in raising the particular Member of Parliament, who, by a strange quirk of coincidence, managed to produce the letter in the nick of time to come to his aid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman says "No," but he certainly gave no indication of that sort of evidence previously. I am sure that he would have been tempted to quote it earlier in our discussions on the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will not want to mislead or suggest that I have been misleading. He knows, because he has held office in my Department, that very large numbers of private office cases come across one's desk every night. They are letters on constituency cases that have been sent by Members of Parliament. That letter happens to be one of those, and I had to deal with it last night. It is dated 15th February.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a timely coincidence then. I accept the hon. and learned Gentleman's point. However, I think that the argument was substantially demolished, particularly by my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) when he talked about the pool of supply teachers and so on. Anyone knowing anything about education and comprehensive schools and how they operate could only come to the conclusion that that headmaster is, to say the least, a trifle quirky.<br><br>
I would have suggested, were it not that the date that the hon. and learned Gentle-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1214</span>
man has given me proves otherwise, that it could have been from the former headmaster of a well-known comprehensive school in my constituency, namely, High-bury Grove.Itread very much as though that particular hon. Gentleman might have written it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for having missed a part of the debate this afternoon. But did the hon. and learned Gentleman disclose what sort of a queer school it is in which the headmaster appoints the staff? I do not know any school which does not have either a local education authority or a managing body which appoints the staff. Did my hon. Friend manage to solve the mystery of what sort of strange school that was?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I have to tell my hon. Friend that we did not get into that sort of detail. I shall readily give way to the hon. and learned Gentleman if he feels able to amplify his remarks about the letter, but one realises his difficulty and I fear that we shall never know. I shall have to be content with what he has told us—inadequate once again though it may be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Wackford Squeers. That is who it was.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The third piece of evidence that the hon. and learned Gentleman fell back upon, yet again, was the surveys referred to in the Low Pay Unit report. No one can dispute that the figures he quoted are there, but once again, I submit, he has drawn the entirely wrong conclusion from those figures. He did not seek at any stage—again, I shall willingly give way if he would like to do so—to deal with the point that I made earlier on clause 10 that he will be creating two classes of women workers in terms of their rights.<br><br>
The first class—this is particularly relevant to the survey—will be those who understand the law and, to safeguard their position, will make certain that they write back and say that they are returning. I suggest to the Minister—I think that this is the implication of the Low Pay Unit's remarks—that the percentages that he so fondly quoted will rise and there will be more women suggesting they are coming back, even though they are not. Therefore, one creates greater uncertainty.<br><br>
I do not think that on any one of the

points that he made the hon. and learned Gentleman's evidence is really worthwhile. He said that our arguments fall short of the persuasive. I can only say that this afternoon he has graced us with his eloquent worst.<br><br>
The Minister finished by saying that the Government's view is that the Act unamended would remain a disadvantage to women generally and particularly to their employment opportunities. My hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) raised an important matter when he pointed out that, if we were to take the view that the hon. and learned Gentleman takes, all sorts of other legislation would be scrapped, to the detriment of working people. I think particularly of the wages council legislation, of which one sometimes hears criticism for the same reasons that the hon. and learned Gentleman is giving us in justifica-</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly agreed to:</i></p>
<p><i>Clause</i> 10, <i>as amended,</i> ordered to stand <i>part of the Bill</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Lead bitter. Perhaps I could at this stage raise a matter with regard to clause 14, which we have not yet reached, and seek your guidance. Certain matters in relation to clause 14 raised with the Attorney-General in a Select Committee brought from him a letter which I shall quote. It concerns the legal immunities of trade unions, and in it the Attorney-General says:
<br><blockquote><p>"My duty as a Law Officer to provide advice to the House does not extend beyond the giving of advice in relation to … the meaning and effect of proposed legislation … I discharge my duty by intervening in debate on the Floor of the House or in Standing Committee on a Bill where by Standing Order 63 I have a right to take part in the deliberations of the Committee."</p></blockquote>
The Attorney-General declined to explain the law with regard to clause I4 to the Select Committee and indicated, obviously correctly, that he would be able to inter-</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1216</span>
<p>tion of this clause. I do not think that even the hon. and learned Gentleman would suggest that that legislation should be swept away on the basis of the same arguments that he has presented to us today—at least, I hope not.</p>
<p>I do not believe that the Minister's arguments hold water. I do not understand how they could in the face of the various representations that he has had and that we have heard from those who represent working women. Surely, their voices ought to be of paramount importance. They know best—perhaps better than any of us in this Committee. In view of that, it is not unreasonable for us to suggest that the Government have got it wrong and that clause I0 should not stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p>5 pm</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 12, Noes 9.</p>
<p>vene in a debate in the Standing Committee on the matter.</p>
<p>I should like your guidance, Mr. Lead-bitter on what would be the procedure for us to invite the Attorney-General to come and explain the implications of, to use his words, the meaning and effect of clause 14, which has been the subject of widespread misunderstanding—not with regard to its desirability, which, of course, is a matter for inter-party debate but as to its actual interpretation once it is passed.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are two principal matters arising from that point or order. First, the House charges this Committee to proceed with the Bill. What happens in another place does not affect that responsibility. Second, and more precisely, neither members of the Committee, nor the Chair can invite a Law Officer, but Standing Order No. 63 lays down clearly that a Law Officer
<br><blockquote><p>"may take part in the deliberations of the committee, but shall not vote or make any motion or move any amendment or be counted in the quorum."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1155">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1217</span>
Therefore, unless a Law Officer seeks of himself to come to the Committee, the Committee is obliged in the ordinary way, to proceed with the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. The last Standing Committee of which I was a member, which was a Standing Committee on a Private Member's Bill, derived great advantage from the attendance at its proceedings at one stage of both—though they came separately—the Solicitor-General and the Solicitor-General for Scotland, for there was in that case a rather special question about Scottish law.<br><br>
Those Law Officers did exactly as the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) has said. They did not speak about the merits of what was before us but merely told us what would e likely to happen in the courts as a consequence of the clause we were considering. Both sides of the Committee agreed that great benefit was derived from that.<br><br>
I understand your ruling very well, Mr. Leadbitter. The presence of the Attorney-General in the Committee must spring up like an early crocus from the earth. It has to be utterly spontaneous. But, for all the great regard that I have for the right hon. and learned Gentleman, I cannot think how the Attorney-General can conceivably know where we are in the Bill and whether we have reached the stage where his advice to us would be helpful—as I profoundly believe it would be.<br><br>
Would it not, therefore, be in order to suggest that the Secretary of the State, who is a member of the Committee, or the hon. and learned Gentleman, might drop a quiet, friendly—I almost said comradely—word into the ear of the right hon. and learned Gentleman and suggest that, if he were spontaneously to spring up out of the ground, his presence would be greatly welcomed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Radice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I also am a member of the Select Committee to which the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) referred. It is clear from that letter that the Attorney-General sees that he has certainly a right—you have confirmed that—to advise this Committee on a point of law. Following what my hon. Friend has just said, it may be that we could use not the usual channels but legal channels—one
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1218</span>
lawyer to another—to get the Attorney-General to the Committee for clause 14. It would be very helpful for all concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. There was a point in the Attorney-General's letter which I did not quote which may help, if an invitation were somehow spontaneously accepted. He says:
<br><blockquote><p>"With regard to those of your particular questions which relate to the meaning and effect of proposed legislation, the Standing Committee on the Employment Bill would be the proper place for me to advise, if necessary. There, however, I would be speaking in debate and not attending as a witness subject to cross-examination."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. What my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) said about precedent and practice in the House is amply supported by my own experience and that of the hon. and learned Gentleman himself. He will recall, for example, that when we shared Committee duty on the Health and Safety at Work etc. Bill, we had the Solicitor-General along to deal with a particular point. Before that, I recall, when the previous Conservative Government's counter-inflation measures were taken in Committee, we had the then Solicitor-General along.<br><br>
More significant than that is the fact that the Attorney-General has already commented on the Floor of the House recently on the effect of clause 14 on the law on picketing. In reply to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Lyon), he said that clause 14 extended in some minor way the scope of the criminal law on picketing. I had it much in mind that we should have to ask the Attorney-General to explain that to the Committee, in the light of the insistence of the Secretary of State on Second Reading that it did nothing of the kind.<br><br>
That is another important reason why we ought to have the Attorney-General come to the Committee, at least to explain the guidance that he has already offered, notwithstanding his letter to the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listed with care to what has been said. The view of the Chair must conform with the Standing Order. Neither this Committee nor the Chair can invite the Attorney-General but, if there is need to have an early crocus
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1156">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1219</span>
spring from the ground in the form of the Attorney-General, I assume that someone can do the cultivation in the ways open to hon. Members. I can only advise that, should an hon. Member or Minister, outside this Committee seek somehow to have the Attorney-General consider that he should come himself to the Committee, that is the only way in which that objective can be achieved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Leadbitter.Itdo not wish to delay the Committee, but if such a metamorphosis of information were to get across to the Attorney-General and he arrived, would he be able only to address himself to clause 14, or would it be in order for him at the same time to refer retrospectively to clauses with which we have already dealt?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Attorney-General himself would be fully appraised of his responsibilities and the extent to which he could address the Committee. We should not anticipate or seek to condition what he might be expected to say, if he should consider that he would like to come here, before he arrives. The Attorney-General will have sufficient legal and procedural experience in this House to come along—if he should decide to do so—and tell the Committee what he feels it prudent to say.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 154, in page 12, leave out from beginning of line 6 to end of line 20 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2) The size and the administrative resources of the employer's undertaking shall not be considered when determining the reasonableness of a dismissal under this section."</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 145, in page 12, line 13, leave out "not reasonably practicable "and insert "impracticable".</p>
<p>No. 147, in page 12, line 13, leave out "reasonably".</p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1220</span>
<p>No. 149, in page 12, line 13, after "practicable, insert "—
<br><blockquote><p>"for a reason other than redundancy and other than that her job has been filled by an employee engaged to do her work during her absence on maternity leave".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 146, in page 12, line 23, leave out "not reasonably practicable "and insert "impracticable".</p>
<p>No. 151, in page 12, line 23, leave out "reasonably".</p>
<p>No. 152, in page 12, line 24, after "redundancy", insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"and other than that her job has been filled whether by an employee engaged to do her work during her absence on maternity leave or by any other employee".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We had a wide debate on clause 10, during which, on more than one occasion, my right hon. and hon. Friends and I had cause to tell the hon. and learned Gentleman that we felt he had not produced any worthwhile evidence to back his case. As fat as one can see, and in advance of hearing the hon. and learned Gentleman, the same situation will prevail again here with a vengeance. Even the Under-Secretary, on clause 5, I believe, said that, when we reached clause 11 where we were talking about a two-tier system, our arguments would have more validity—though he hastened to assure us that he would still have to reject them.<br><br>
I hope, however, that, in rejecting them, he will put on a better display than he could on clause 10.<br><br>
In dealing with clause 10, the hon. and learned Gentleman made extensive use of the Low Pay Unit's evidence, as well as the views of the Equal Opportunities Commission. He will understand if I take a leaf out of his book on clause 11 and myself quote extensively from the Low Pay Unit on these amendments. The paper with which the unit has supplied us is extremely helpful. I shall try to bury the hon. and learned Gentleman under the weight of evidence. I suspect that he will not be able to offer similar weight on his side.<br><br>
The Low Pay Unit, in referring to clause 11, says:
<br><blockquote><p>"This clause has received widespread criticism from, among other bodies, the Equal Opportunities Commission,"</p></blockquote>
to whose views I shall come presently—
<br><blockquote><p>"the National Council for Civil Liberties, the Conservative Trade Unionists"—</p></blockquote>
I confess that I have no details of what the Conservative Trade Unionists has to say about the matter, but I have no doubt that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1157">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1221</span>
the hon. and learned Gentleman will have a chapter and verse account of that which perhaps will be able to give us, as its members are his own party supporters.<br><br>
The Briefing also mentions criticism from the Institute of Personnel Managers. It states that:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is potentially the most damaging of all the proposed amendments to existing maternity rights, and … deserves the strongest opposition."</p></blockquote>
It is not difficult, looking at this clause, to subscribe to that view and, therefore, to explain why we seek to amend the clause on the basis of the group of amendments that we are now debating.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
The Low Pay Unit's evidence covers the ground again in relation to the ORC study which we have talked about <i>ad infinitum</i> in Committee. I shall not therefore weary hon. Members by going over it again unless the hon. and learned Gentleman would like me to do so. I doubt if he would, although he may choose to refer to it himself in which case we can return to it.<br><br>
In dealing with that matter, the Low Pay Unit makes it clear that in its opinion the findings of the Department of Employment's survey come down against these proposed changes in the law. It then talks about evidence from employers' associations which it describes as "even less conclusive ". It states that:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Association of Independent Businesses submitted a paper to the Department of Industry on June 26th entitled ' Effects of Existing Legislation upon Recruitment, employment and the conduct of business '. Nowhere in the 4½ page document is any mention made of maternity provisions. The Forum of Independent Business conducted a small survey in April 1979, and produced no evidence that maternity provisions were damaging their firms. The National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses published a survey of 1,000 of its members (out of a total membership of 50,000) in July 1979. No specific mention of the maternity provisions appears in the report."</p></blockquote>
In fairness, one should add that the Low Pay Unit also states:
<br><blockquote><p>"(In its submission to the Government last June, the NFSE commented that ' the right to time off, with pay, for maternity and reinstatement is objectionable'. But no basis for this statement appears in the survey report.)"</p></blockquote>
The unit gives only one instance of supporting evidence for the Government, which is from the Small Businesses Bureau survey. Again, it points out that the questions asked there were of a leading nature and that, as we have heard in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1222</span>
Committee, the organisation is very closely linked to Conservative Central Office. It can, therefore, hardly be descried as an independent survey.<br><br>
The unit continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"In short we could find no evidence to support the proposed exemption of small firms. It is clear from a recent Parliamentary Question that the Government believes that this exemption ' should encourage employers to empty more women.' (<i>Hansard,</i> December 18). But we would argue that it is quite possible that the exemption would have the opposite effect."</p></blockquote>
We argued that on the previous clause. The briefing goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"This is the view, for example, of the Institute of Personnel Management which is totally opposed to the exemption of small firms from maternity provisions: ' Small, far from being beautiful, would become synonymous with disadvantaged.' (IMP New Release, November 19, 1979). Similar criticism was made by the EOC in its response to the proposed amendments: 'Women of childbearing age might be reluctant to work for small employers and some small employers might not be able to recruit from as wide a range of potential employees '. The EOC also pointed out that in order to justify a decision that it was' not reasonably practicable ' to reinstate all employees".</p></blockquote>
That phrase "not reasonably practicable" is one that we seek to amend in this group of amendments—but in that situation:
<br><blockquote><p>"small employers might be faced with Industrial Tribunal hearings in order to justify their actions".</p></blockquote>
So it goes on. I do not want to refer to further points from that document at this stage.<br><br>
I wish to refer again to the Equal Opportunities Commission, because the hon. and learned Gentleman has referred to it. I shall therefore quote in a little more detail for his benefit what it has had to say about clause II. The EOC's recent briefing paper—I am sure that the Minister has had a copy—suggests the following questions, and I shall content myself with posing them. The Minister has cited them in his favour on the previous clause, so I am sure that he will give them full weight.
<br><blockquote><p>"Are the terms 'suitable alternative employment ','not substantially less favourable 'and' not reasonably practicable' clear enough to allow industrial tribunals to make consistent judgments in cases of dispute?"</p></blockquote>
It is clear from the form of the EOC 's question that it does not think so and, of course, being a body of considerable experience of industrial tribunal hearings—it represents people at such hearings—it knows what it is talking about.<br><br>
The EOC asks:
<br><blockquote><p>"At what point would the employee be informed that she is not to return to the same job? During
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1158">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1223</span>
her maternity leave or on the day she returns? Will the employee, given her absence, have enough information to decide whether or not it was possible for the employer to reinstate in the original job? How far will employees be discouraged from taking a case to a tribunal because of the other problems associated with returning to work and caring for a young baby? Will some employers be tempted to use this provision to discourage the employee from returning or to place her in a job with, for example, less promotion prospects?"</p></blockquote>
Then we turn to the small firms' aspect of this. Again, the EOC makes clear that it is not in favour of that exemption and poses several questions, as follows:
<br><blockquote><p>"Given a lack of evidence to demonstrate that small employers are experiencing great difficulties, is it justifiable to create two classes of employee, those working for small employers, and others?"</p></blockquote>
We have touched on this matter previously.<br><br>
It continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"In view of the fact that many women seek local work, often with small firms, with this change affect a disproportionate number of female employees?"</p></blockquote>
The paper finishes by saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"The changes in maternity rights put forward in the Bill erode the principle that the maternity rights package was intended to protect women from disadvantage in employment, when they took time off to bear children. This principle has been breached by allowing employers to offer women returning to work jobs when could be less favourable than their original jobs."</p></blockquote>
There we have the views of the EOC, so, whatever the hon. and learned Gentleman may have said previously, I do not think that he can be in any doubt on this clause. I have further quotes from Lady Lockwood, the chairman of the EOC, with which I shall not weary the Committee but which back up and endorse the views that I have expressed.<br><br>
As for small firms, I should like to refer to another piece of what one might call negative evidence. I have here the recent report on small businesses of the Greater London council's planning and communications policy committee dated 11th March. That committee carried out a special survey of small businesses. A consultative document was circulated, and the comments were received back. Incidentally, this is the Conservative-controlled GLC.<br><br>
The document states:
<br><blockquote><p>"A wide range of valuable points emerged in the responses to the discussion paper. Those that seem to be particularly worthy of note are summarised in the following paragraphs:"</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1224</span>
I shall not read through the paragraphs, but I shall give the headings, which are: "Taxation", in which respondents criticise the tax system for working against the healthy development of small businesses; "Finance", which deals with the problems of and limited possibilities for raising finance and which has generated considerable comment; "Information", which deals with information, advice and training for entrepreneurs; "Premises", which identifies a major difficulty as being a lack of suitable premises of the right size and at the right price, and so on; "Planning"—major simplifications of planning procedures are advocated—and" Bureaucracy and other issues ". Under that heading, it says:
<br><blockquote><p>"A number of suggestions were made regarding the removal of onerous form-filling tasks and restrictive legislation."</p></blockquote>
In the more detailed paragraph under the heading "Bureaucracy and legislative constraints" on page 7, the council comments:
<br><blockquote><p>"In the same sphere the Council recognises that legislation in fields such as employment protection is required to protect the basic well-being of Londoners as employees. It is the case, however, that these laws are often confusingly presented to the small employer and enforced in an insensitive manner."</p></blockquote>
The one thing it does not suggest is that any of the legislation should be scrapped, and there is no evidence from the survey that any of the small firms had any concern for maternity rights. If it is such a problem, surely the largest local authority in the country—no doubt with thousands of small companies in its area—would have uncovered that degree of concern in its survey. Once again, we find that the evidence does not show up in surveys.<br><br>
I think it was my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) who mentioned the Royal College of Nursing when we were discussing clause 10. The Royal College of Nursing has expressed a view on clause 11, too. It believes
<br><blockquote><p>"that it is premature to introduce provisions which would weaken the rights of women to return to work after confinement. It considers that no grounds exist, in equity, for denying employees of small firms the right to return and suggests that arrangements about suitable alternative work could normally be left to be agreed between employer and employee."</p></blockquote>
I have, too, the views of the Equal Pay and Opportunity Campaign. Again, it is opposed to the Government's proposition.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1159">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1225</span>
I come now to the detail of the Amendments. The Bill provides exemption for a firm of five or fewer employees, and the employer has to prove that it was not "reasonably practicable" to offer the same job or one "not substantially less favourable". In that respect, there are three main arguments against the clause.<br><br>
First, as I have already said, the Department's own survey revealed no evidence of small firms experiencing difficulties, and I have quoted a whole series of documents from organisations showing that that is the case. Secondly, there is this need for the employer to prove that it was not "reasonably practicable" to offer the woman back her job. This will lead to difficulties at industrial tribunals, and comes back to the question that the hon. and learned Gentleman will find in the EOC briefing, whether the phrases "reasonably practicable" and "not substantially less favourable" are sufficiently clear to avoid inconsistent judgments at tribunals in cases of dispute.<br><br>
I am sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman will tend to say that tribunals deal with this sort of thing all the time, but at the same time, he has been telling us that he wants to create more certainty. That is the purpose of the Bill and the primary purpose of the changes in maternity benefit. It is highly questionable to say the least whether the clause will create more certainty. My view is that it will create more uncertainty and difficulty and, almost inevitably, more inconsistency in cases which actually reach tribunals.<br><br>
The third and perhaps the most important argument on amendment No. 148 is that the creation of any special categories of employment involving employees' rights is undesirable—this brings us back to the two-tier argument which the Government's own consultative document conceded was undesirable. How they square their decision to go ahead in this way with that consultative document is not easy to understand. I suppose the hon. and learned Gentleman will argue that the balance has to be struck and that it is best struck by the Bill. I submit that that is not the case and that this is a highly undesirable change which is not proven in any way.<br><br>
We do not know the numbers who might be affected by it. But certainly if the Government accept amendment No. 148, that will set our minds at rest to a considerable degree. I fear that is not much of a runner.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1226</span>
5.30 pm<br><br>
Amendment No. 154 would improve the position of a woman exercising her unfair dismissal rights under section 56 of the 1978 Act. The hon. and learned Gentleman may be able to help me here. There could be a drafting error involved which might make the amendment unnecessary.<br><br>
The Bill amends the definition of "reasonableness" in the 1978 Act, but it does not amend the definition in schedule 2. That is the provision that applies to unfair dismissal actions relating to maternity rights. If there is a drafting error in the Bill and this paragraph of the schedule has not been altered, along with the section in the main Act, I think that the amendment is necessary. f it is the Government's intention to leave unfair dismissals relating to maternity rights to be taken under the old "reasonableness" definition, the amendment is not necessary.<br><br>
On the basis that it is necessary, the new definition of an employer acting reasonably in a dismissal takes into account the size and administrative resources of the firm. The Government agreed that in clause 5.<br><br>
There is already a small-firm exemption introduced by section 56, and it is apparent that the new definition would allow small firms with more than five employees to dismiss fairly. So a woman exercising her maternity rights must now clear several hurdles. First, there is what I think one calls the pre-trial review of an industrial tribunal case. I can refer to the working paper in that respect, but I think that is the phrase used. That means that a woman will be disadvantaged in arguing at that stage without the discovery of documents about the size and administrative resources and the reasonable practicability of the offer of the same job. One goes back to the arguments about precisely what is meant by "administrative resources", and we can have all sorts of arguments again about reasonable practicability. That is a hurdle that a woman will initially have to meet.<br><br>
Secondly, although the employer has the burden of proof if he is using the section 56A exclusion provision, the employee has to argue "reasonably practicable," "unreasonable refusal" or "substantially less favourable", before she can argue that it is an unfair dismissal within section 56. That is a second and quite formidable hurdle for a woman to have to clear.<br><br>
Thirdly, the reasonableness of the dismissal is then judged on the firm's size and administrative resources. So one way
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1160">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1227</span>
of easing the difficulties for a woman bringing a case of unfair dismissal under section 56 would be to exempt those cases from what one could call the new and harsher test of reasonableness.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 145, 146, 147 and 151—I think that they can be bracketed together—are aimed at placing a higher degree of care on the employer to permit a woman to return to work.<br><br>
The Bill lays down that an employer does not have to give a woman her job back if it is not "reasonably practicable "and if she is offered an alternative job and refuses it. The conditions for judging whether or not a job is suitable seem to me to be very broad, loose and ill-defined. It is not unfair to suggest that in those circumstances any woman must feel apprehensive, to put it at its least, about leaving work to have a baby and still feeling secure that, if her job still exists, she can go back to it.<br><br>
There is an insecurity built into the Bill in that respect. It would be assisted by acceptance of those amendments.<br><br>
Amendment No. 149 is straightforward in seeking to protect a woman's job and in ensuring that an employer takes on a maternity replacement only for the period of time that the woman is to be away. The same argument applies to amendment No. 152 with which I have not dealt.<br><br>
The Government's proposals create two groups of working women, those with statutory reinstatement rights and those without them in the smaller firms. It conflicts with the Government's aim, as expressed in the consultative document, of not having a two-tier system. They seem to be saying that they do not want a two-tier system, but that here and there, where it suits their convenience, they will have one.<br><br>
The option of suitable alternative employment rather than giving the original job back diminishes women's rights, not just in small firms. The present option is strictly limited to redundancy.<br><br>
So far we have had—the hon. and learned Gentleman may be able to help us, but I rather doubt it—no real guidance on the phrase "reasonably practicable", and I think that will create uncertainty and doubt. The likely outcome is that employers may put less effort into keeping jobs open or finding temporary replacements.<br><br>
If that is so, I believe that would present a real and severe setback for working
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1228</span>
women whose rights in this respect have been won gradually as the result of a long, hard struggle for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Needham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With regard to very small companies, with which I have been associated, what about the rights of the person who comes to replace the lady who is pregnant? In a very small company, one cannot just take somebody for a temporary period of six months to do the wages or the bookkeeping. That is quite impossible. Surely one has to make sure that when the temporary person is employed, he or she comes on a permanent basis. One cannot get people otherwise This problem crops up time and again with small companies.<br><br>
If it happens, it will result in taking on somebody that the company will have to con by saying that the job is permanent, when in reality it is for only six months. If one does not say that the job is temporary, one will get nobody and the company may go out of business if there is nobody to pay the wages or do the books; a key function in a small company. What does the hon. Gentleman say to that? What about the rights of the person involved?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member could not have been in the Committee room this morning when we discussed this, because his hon. and learned Friend raised the same matter about the rights of the temporary workers. I should have been rather more impressed with what he had had to say if he had seriously suggested that rights should be given to these people, instead of which the Government in their recent legislation, which has already been approved by the House, have made it much more difficult for people to qualify for rights, particularly in respect of unfair dismissal. It clearly is crocodile tears. But, of course, the hon. Gentleman has a point. No one is pretending that there will never be difficulties. We have to strike a balance here in deciding whose interests are best served.<br><br>
But if his argument is pursued to its logical conclusion, he will put out of business many employment agencies which supply full-time temporary workers. They make a good living out of doing so. Many small employers use the services of those agencies and find it a suitable and convenient way to operate.<br><br>
No one says that there will be no difficulties at all on the basis of what my hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1161">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1229</span>
Friend said, but it is a question of balance, and we are convinced that the Government have got the balance utterly wrong. On that basis, I rest my case on the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is unfortunate—although perhaps not from our point of view—that throughout the debates on the Bill the Government are exposing their dedication to the notion that all citizens are equal, but some are more equal than others. This has come up continually and now we are being asked once again to approve the notion of first-class and second-class citizens. I have described the notion as abhorrent before, and I do so again.<br><br>
We are being asked, once again, to make arrangements for people who work for small firms to have less protection than those who work for larger firms. I see no reason in natural justice why people who work for small firms should have fewer rights than those who work for large. A large number of people work for small firms, and we are often told that the future of the country largely depends on small firms and their ability to expand and grow into big firms. I do not understand why we should be asked to provide positive disincentives to firms to grow. We have done this in a previous clause—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Who provides the employment—the employer or the employee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Employment is provided by the economic conditions in which firms operate. No one snaps a finger and creates employment. It is there if the demand for it is there. Obviously, a small firm wishing to expand if the demand for its goods or services is present has an incentive to do so. But schemes which create different conditions according to the size of the firm produce a disincentive if, as we are told, the conditions which will apply to larger firms create problems for smaller ones.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) pointed out that there was no evidence to support the view that this created a problem. But the Minister cannot have it both ways. He cannot argue from both points of view at the same time. If, as he tells us, the provisions relating to employees of larger firms create enormous problems for small
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1230</span>
firms and therefore must not apply, there must be a disincentive to a small firm to become larger.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Radice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter of simple logic. Why does the party which claims to speak for small businesses wish to discourage them from expanding and becoming more successful and profitable and taking on more people? That is the key question. I hope that at some stage we shall receive an answer to it.<br><br>
During a previous debate, the Minister assured us that he did not wish to take away existing rights. This is precisely what this clause does. I do not see anything in the clause which says that the new provisions will apply only to new employees. That concession—if concession it be—was made in the clause relating to small firms and unfair dismissal. The existing employees of small firms, in that case those with fewer than 20 employees, were to retain their existing rights, and only the new employees would have a lower level of protection. In this clause, there is no such suggestion. Existing employees of firms employing five people or fewer will have existing rights taken away from them if this is carried.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
That brings me to a question I raised during our debate on clause 10, which was not answered and which is equally, perhaps even more, germane to clause 11. Is it fair and equitable to take away, at the moment the Bill is enacted, rights which have existed for pregnant women? At the date when this measure becomes law, those rights will be lost.<br><br>
Women who are expecting children before the Bill becomes law will lose the rights they are entitled to expect to apply to them at the time their children are born. It is a matter of much importance, and I wish that the Under-Secretary of State would deal with it. To remove from women the right to expect a certain set of provisions to apply nine months after conception seems grossly unfair.<br><br>
The point goes much wider. The Government are proposing to remove existing rights for firms employing five people or fewer, and there is a clear discouragement. It is not true that this will encourage people to employ more women. On the contrary, if an employer now has five
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1162">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1231</span>
people on his staff of whom, possibly, only one is a woman, and he then sets on one more person, whether a man or a woman; he has taken himself out of the category covered by the clause. So there is a positive disincentive, not merely to set on more women but to set on more people, either men or women.<br><br>
I should like to hear the Under-Secretary of State explain how that kind of provision will create more employment opportunities either for women or for men. It seems to me to have precisely the opposite effect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Needham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might make some brief comments on amendment No. 148. It is important for the Committee to understand the problems faced by small businesses, not only for those with five employees or fewer, but perhaps those with 10 or fewer. I should like to quote some personal experience in that regard because it has some relevance.<br><br>
Let us suppose that there is a business that employs, say, two ladies out of a total of 10 people, one of whom does the bookwork and the other, say, running one of the printing machines. In these days of equal opportunities, that might very well happen. One of the ladies, perhaps the one doing the books, then becomes pregnant. It is a crucial job for a small business, a job on which the business depends, obviously not to paying only the employees' wages, but also ensuring that the company's financial figures are available at the end of every month. When times are hard, it is difficult for a business to keep going unless the affairs of the company are presented regularly to the workers and management. The lady who becomes pregnant may have been in that job for many years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can quite see the point. Could the hon. Member tell me what he does when that lady takes her month's holiday?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Needham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A month's holiday is not six months' absence. As the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) might know if he had ever been involved in small businesses, it is difficult for anybody in a small business to take a month's holiday on the trot. Few small business men can do that. What happens is that the holiday is taken over two weeks, then another two weeks, or three weeks and one
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1232</span>
week. In some small businesses, including mine, I am delighted to tell him, it is not one month's holiday, but five weeks' holiday, negotiated, no doubt, with the help of the unions. It is taken as two weeks, two weeks and a week, and so on. Small businesses have to adapt to that kind of problem.<br><br>
I return to the point that I am trying to make. When that happens in a small business, it cannot then not get someone from an employment agency to do the crucial job. There are vast numbers of such agencies in Yeovil or Crewkerne, the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) may be surprised to know. The employer cannot ask someone to do a job that requires responsibilities so crucial to the business and take her on for only six months.Itprobably takes three months to learn the ins and outs of the job.<br><br>
I have listened in astonishment to some of the arguments advanced by the Opposition. They do not seem to have had any experience of that sort of thing. One cannot get someone in for a month and teach her a job. If one could, there would be strong argument in favour of such a proposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Radice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All that the hon. Gentleman has been saying is just an argument against employing women in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Needham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not; that is absolute nonsense. We are talking about the sort of job that women, because they are neat and tidy, do very much better than men. Because of that, they deserve to be paid more than the men who would otherwise do the job. I am all in favour of employing such women.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not also a fact that when an employer takes on temporary staff, he probably has to pay them more than he would a permanent employee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Needham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the point, but it is not really a question of staff being temporary and having to be paid more. It is a question of knowing the business. The same would apply in the case of the printer. It is not very easy to find a printer to replace for six months a lady who is pregnant. I cannot conceive of circumstances in which a lady printer would be employed in those conditions. Having been trained to run a KORD or Thompson machine, she could not be told
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1163">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1233</span>
after six months "I am terribly sorry; you must leave".<br><br>
What happens in practice? These things are often more a matter of practice than of principle. If it is a question of practice, one sits down with the lady concerned when she becomes pregnant—[<i>Laughter</i>]—which I assure you, Mr. Leadbitter, is by far the best thing to do, for the lady's health as well as one's own. When the matter has been discussed—in the case of my old company, the lady was called Marjorie—one asks "How can we come to an arrangement about this? "Marjorie, being a sensible girl, understanding and happily married with two children, turns round and says "I shall not take up my rights in these circumstances. It would be grossly wrong for the company and the person whom you bring in if I were to do so." In that case, the Act would not apply. If it did, it would be grossly unfair.<br><br>
Is it, therefore, not much more sensible, in these days, when there are five or six people in a small company in which every job is crucial to the company's future, to accept the realities of the circumstances and let those concerned work it out together, which is what happens anyway?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure, when the hon. Gentleman referred to speaking to that lady "when she becomes pregnant", that he meant some time after she became pregnant. I do not imagine that he was there at the time. But, on a more serious note, may I ask him what he would do about that same lady when she became ill or what he would do about a male employee who was taken ill? Would he say "I am sorry, my firm is so small that it cannot stand people being off and, therefore, I am afraid that you will have to be sacked so that I can replace you"? Pregnancy is not the only reason for people to be off work. What kind of test would the hon. Gentleman apply in other cases—possibly of prolonged illness?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Needham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a very good question. We have an insurance policy for those who are ill over a long period, so that the company can withstand such losses. An insurance policy helps the company get over the period. But if the person is ill for longer than six months, once again it is in the contract of employment that he or she is fully paid for the six months, but that thereafter, if somebody else has been found to do the job, again
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1234</span>
that would be quite wrong. The worker understands this, having trained the person to do the job.<br><br>
This is the sort of problem that small companies face every day. Somebody may get a serious back injury and be off work. One may have no idea how long he will be off work, so somebody else is taken on for six or nine months. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that at the end of those six or nine months we fire the people whom we have taken on? That is intolerable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a substantial clutch of amendments, which enables us to discuss fairly comprehensively the philosophy of the clause and the steps that have to be taken before those who are intended to benefit from the protection given by the clause can establish their claim. The need for this protection is established by what has been said to hon. Members, I do not doubt, on both sides of the Committee on the part of and on behalf of those who have to carry on business, particularly in the country's smaller businesses.<br><br>
What the clause achieves is that in the case of a very small firm there is no right to return, if the firm's employees do not exceed five and if the employer finds that it is not reasonably practicable to offer back the old job or to offer a suitable alternative. In the case of all firms, the clause establishes that if a firm, for any reason other than redundancy, finds that it is not reasonably practicable to offer the old job back, but the employer offers a suitable alternative which the employee accepts or unreasonably rejects, in that case there shall be relief from the obligation to pay compensation for unfair dismissal if the person is not reinstated in the old job.<br><br>
It would be tempting to go over all the ground that we covered in our lengthy debates on clause I0 on need, demand and so on. In relation to the Opinion Research Centre survey I think that I said when we were debating clause 7, that there was something of a bran-tub and something for everybody. In this case, I must concede that the views, for example, of the Equal Opportunities Commission differ from those of the Government on what is desirable. But among the many responses that we have had to the working paper in which we set out the nature of our proposals and our thinking back in September, there is wide support for what we propose in the Bill.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1164">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1235</span>
Indeed, we would not have set it out in the working paper nor foreshadowed it in our manifesto had we not been well aware that there was evidence of need.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
In our manifesto, we said that we would reform those aspects of the employment protection legislation which were operating in such a way as to harm employment prospects. Going back to the days when Lord Lever held responsibility for small firms in the previous Labour Government, it will be recalled that in November 1978 the noble Lord said that we must take care to see that the Employment Protection Act did not become an Employment Destruction Act. We foreshadowed this, because we had and still have our ear fairly closely to the ground as a party on employment matters. We recognise—there is plenty of independent authority for this—that it is particularly in the area of the small firms that we can most hopefully look for the creation of new jobs.<br><br>
The reason is not difficult to find. A small firm working within a small locality is much more easily able to spot a new market opportunity and move in quickly than can the manager of a much larger firm with more widely delegated areas of responsibility. A small firm is able to move quicker; it is a frigate as compared to a capital ship. That is why the Massachusetts Institute, for example, reported that in America by far the greater proportion of new jobs were to be found created by the small firms sector.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it is not right, I shall be corrected, but if it is not Massachusetts Institute, it is Mr. Birch. At any rate, it is the experience across the Atlantic and here that the small firms sector is more volatile and more able to react to new market opportunities.<br><br>
Here, I have to acknowledge that in the case of those who work for very small firms as defined in the clause we are diminishing certain rights. I have to acknowledge that and I acknowledge that it is not our intention to create to any significant extent two tiers. We do not like it, and we do not want to do it, But, as so often is the case, there are desirable objectives which pull us in opposite directions. Surely it is common ground in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1236</span>
Committee, and in the whole House, that a desirable objective is to diminish unemployment and to encourage the creation of new jobs.<br><br>
On the other hand, it is a desirable objective not to prejudice the opportunities of women to find work. That is equally desirable. But those objectives pull in opposite directions If it be the case—and I know that this is challenged—that those provisions of our existing law whose purpose is to protect the employment opportunities of women are working in a way which serves to diminish the amount of employment that they are offered, that calls for a judgment on the part of Government on what, if anything, ought to be done.<br><br>
When we set out our thinking in September, we have it in mind—and said so—to provide especially for firms which employed 20 or fewer in this regard. However, we took account of views expressed that that was going too widely, and in the Bill we have reduced this part of the clause's provision so that it shall apply to firms which employ five or fewer. But we did not think it right to abandon the concept altogether. We are absolutely satisfied that in this very small sector there is a need for this special relief from the reinstatement provisions of the Act.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) speaks with great experience of the small firms sector, from his knowledge of the printing industry. The hon. Member for Newham, North-East is not alone in the Committee in his knowledge of the printing industry. The reasons for that need were convincingly expressed by my hon. Friend. He said that if a female employee takes maternity leave, she has to be replaced. If one is a small employer one cannot say "All right, I shall not use that machine," for that may result in 20 per cent, of one's turnover being lost. One has to find a replacement.<br><br>
Who will that replacement be? I quite understand that if one's experience is only of the Metropollis or one of the great cities, one supposes that temporary replacements can be obtained quite readily. I do not criticise hon. Members sitting for London or major city seats for supposing that temps are found easily, but small employers are not to be found exclusively in the great cities, and it is by no means easy to find temporary replacements for skilled jobs, even in the great cities.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1165">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1237</span>
It is the skilled job that we must not lose sight of, as well as the unskilled job. Taking my hon. Friend's example of somebody operating a printing machine, many of which are operated by women, for reasons which are scoffed at—because women's fingers are neater, slimmer and can do some of the delicate jobs more readily than ours can—if an operator of one of these machines goes off, a replacement has to be obtained. It is very difficult, and in many cases quite impossible, to persuade someone to take on this job and do the training for it on the basis that "You will have to go when Marjorie comes back."<br><br>
People will say that they are glad that Marjorie has had the job and that they would like to have it, but are not willing to have three months training only to hand it back to Marjorie and not to have compensation for unfair dismissal at the end of it. Section 61 of the present Act provides specifically for people who have been taken on as temporary replacements for those having babies.<br><br>
One must look to see whether that is something that very small firms can reasonably be expected to bear.<br><br>
The example given by my hon. Friend was terribly in point and very timely, because it indicated that if one is looking at this sensibly and reasonably, one cannot expect the small employer to put up with the application of the law as it applies right across the board. The employer knows that he will have to say to whoever replaces Marjorie "All right, come in on a permanent basis," otherwise he will not get a replacement for Marjorie. But what happens when Marjorie comes back? There will be the most frantic difficulty and embarrassment, not to mention expense.<br><br>
If it is to be said that there is no real difficulty and that the employer can get rid of the replacement, what about his feelings on that matter? What about the effect on his industrial relations, because, if he is like my hon. Friend, he will say " Thank you very much, but I have promised this lady that she will be taken on on a permanent basis and I am not going to go back on my word when Marjorie comes back and so you are out. That is not how I run my business." If he were to run his business like that in Chippenham, Crewkerne or Yeovil, I do not doubt that everybody would get to know about it very quickly and that would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1238</span>
not serve his interests. But knowing my hon. Friend, he would not want to do that.<br><br>
This is the difficulty which has to be looked at. I hope that we can discuss this a bit more rationally than those who dismiss this policy as being mean and petty. This is very much what we had in mind. Accordingly, it leads us to make this special provision.<br><br>
I shall come to some, but perhaps not all, of the questions that the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) asked, because, for some reason or another, we do not appear to be on the mailing list of the briefs for the EOC. I knew of its report on the last clause because of the Low Pay Unit briefing. But I have had a brief look at it and shall answer as many of the hon. Gentleman's questions as I can.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) said that if it is true that large firm provisions create a disincentive for small firms, why do we make a disincentive to small firms to become larger. He says that we are making life easier for small firms—of five and under—and asks whether that will not operate against the Government's declared objective of stimulating employment because they will want to stay small. That is not our belief.<br><br>
Not long ago in our proceedings the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo), who speaks with a lot of experience and authority, said that it is the objective of everyone with a business to make it bigger. Of course, that is right. We all want to do that. But a very small firm can be precarious, unable to stand shocks and fluctuations of fortune and needs protection. The Government have been advised, and they believe, that this change will not create so special and cosy a regime for very small firms that they will not wish to come out of the womb. I do not believe that that will not happen.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether existing employees would retain existing rights. Would it be fair to take away the rights of women expecting children before the Act takes effect? Clause I8 of the Bill deals with transitional provisions, which will cover this situation. Our intention is that the changes brought about by the clause shall apply only where the employee has not, at the operative date, already started her maternity absence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How about someone who is pregnant, who conceived last

night and may be caught by the provisions of the Bill when enacted?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says "caught by the provisions of the Bill when enacted." As I have said, it is our intention that the rights of those who have not started their maternity absence at the date when the Act takes effect, shall not be prejudiced, but it is not our intention, I am afraid—nor do we regard it as practicable-to take account of everybody who has just become pregnant.<br><br>
I shall deal with the individual amendments without spending long over each. Amendment No. 148 is all but a wrecking amendment because its effect is to remove from the clause the provisions which relieve firms with five or fewer employees from the obligation to reinstate an employee after her maternity absence where this was not reasonably practicable. I have already dealt with that question in what I said about the Government's thinking.<br><br>
I now turn to amendments Nos. 154 and 145. Amendment No. 154 deals with the definition, and adds to section 56(1)(b) of the 1978 Act
<br><blockquote><p>"The size and the administrative resources of the employer's undertaking shall not be considered when determining the reasonableness of a dismissal under this section.".</p></blockquote>
We added those words in the positive but not the negative sense when we dealt with clause 5, and the hon. Member for Islington, Central asks what the position is here. The answer is to be found in paragraph 20 of schedule 1, which I shall read:
<br><blockquote><p>"In the subsection set out in paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 2"—</p></blockquote>
to which the hon. Member for Islington, Central referred—
<br><blockquote><p>"to the 1978 Act, for the words from the employer can' to the end there shall be substituted the words ' in the circumstances (including the size and administrative resources of the employer's undertaking) the employer would have been acting reasonably or unreasonably in treating it as a sufficient reason for dismissing the employee if she had not been absent from work; and that question shall be determined in accordance with equity and the substantial merits of the case '."</p></blockquote>
I think that that meets the point properly raised by the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
6.15 pm<br><br>
I turn to amendments Nos. 145, 146, 147 and 151, which the hon. Gentleman
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1240</span>
understandably took at a gallop. They enable me to deal with the questions of interpretation. Amendment No. 145 seeks to substitute for "not reasonably practicable" in section 56A(1) the word "impracticable". Amendment No. 146 would substitute "impracticable" for "not reasonably practicable" in line 23. Amendment No. 147 seeks to leave out "reasonably" from line 13, so that it would read "it is not practicable".<br><br>
Amendment No. 151 seeks to leave out "reasonably" from line 23.<br><br>
The amendments hark back to some of the questions asked by the Equal Opportunities Commission. "Suitable alternative employment" is a concept that is well understood by the tribunals under the existing legislation. Indeed, it is defined in section 45(3) of the 1978 Act. The section refers to the right to return to work. Subsection (4) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The new contract of employment must be such that—(<i>a</i>) the work to be done under the contract is of a kind which is both suitable in relation to the employee and appropriate for her to do in the circumstances; and (<i>b</i>) the provisions of the new contract as to the capacity and place in which she is to be employed and as to the other terms and conditions of her employment are not substantially less favourable to her than if she had returned to work in accordance with subsection(1)."</p></blockquote>
That formula has been lifted straight and imported into the Bill. The tribunals are well familiar with it. If not lifted straight, it has been reproduced.<br><br>
On the question whether "not reasonably practicable" should be turned into "impracticable", the concept of what is reasonably practicable is part of the everyday bread and butter of the tribunals, just as it is of the civil courts and the law of negligence or employer's liability. It is what the tribunals are about, certainly on the subject of unfair dismissal. They take into account—as I have said at wearying length already—all the circumstances.<br><br>
If we substitute "impracticable", I suppose that that would not put too great a burden on the tribunals, because "impracticable" can only mean" not practicable". There are certainly illustrations of that test, "not practicable", to be found in the 1978 Act and the 1975 Act before it. We do not want to do that, because the key criterion is the concept of reasonable practicability. That is what we want to go for. "Not practicable" is a tougher standard. We do not think that we would be justified in going for that.<br><br>

I think I have said enough on those amendments to cover the issues raised by the hon. Gentleman. But there remains amendments Nos. 149 and 152. Amendment No. 149 seeks to remove the reason of redundancy from the scope of the very small firms exemption, so that an employer will have to rely on the current provisions dealing with redundancy.</span></p>
<p>6.20 pm</p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
<p>6.35 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We were dealing with amendments Nos. 149 and I52. I believe that I can best help the Committee by saying that the purpose of amendment No. 149 is to reflect anxiety that the mere fact of the employer taking on a replacement should not on its own constitute a sufficient defence that it was not reasonably practicable to reinstate the woman in her original job. It is extremely improbable that a tribunal would ever accept this standing by itself as a sufficient defence, particularly as the basic principle in the maternity provisions on reinstatement is that the woman will get back her original job and also because it would be rare for there to be any financial constraints on the employer dismissing the replacement.<br><br>
That is supported by a commentary on the Bill by the Industrial Relations Legal Information Bulletin, which said:
<br><blockquote><p>"There is an express burden of proof on the employer to show that he comes within the terms of the exception and it will be noted that the standard required to show that it was 'not reasonably practicable 'to offer the women back her old job is higher than a standard of 'reasonableness 'It is virtually inconceivable that it would be held not reasonably practicable for an employer not to give the woman her original job back on grounds that a temporary replacement had been engaged. The whole structure of the maternity provisions is built on the premise that the women will normally get her original job back and that temporary cover will be arranged. This is why there is special provision in section 61 relating to dismissal of replacements."</p></blockquote>
The provision in the Bill is intended to allow an employer who genuinely finds it not reasonably practicable for some reason connected with a replacement to argue the case, for example, that he had no opportunity to engage a temporary replacement and that he had to replace the woman with a permanent replacement.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1242</span>
If the effect of the amendment were merely to emphasise that the fact of a replacement was not a sufficient defence for an employer, that would not be so objectionable, though it would be effectively superfluous. But the effect would be to remove from; consideration anything to do with that replacement and the whole provision would thereby be undermined because the facts surrounding that replacement are crucial to an employer's successful defence in such a genuine case as that to which I have referred.<br><br>
The tribunal can be left to consider what is reasonably practicable without the amendment, and it is to be expected that the employer would have to show, where appropriate, that it was not possible to make other arrangements. In other words, what we are looking at under amendment No. 149 is the position of a very small employer of five people or fewer. He has to show not only that he employs five people or fewer, but that it is not reasonably practicable for him to offer back to the woman her original job and, further to that, that he cannot offer suitable alternative employment as defined. But we are concentrating on the original job and we believe that it is important that the tribunal should not be prevented from looking at questions that turn upon the engagement of a replacement, because it is a proper matter for the tribunal to consider.<br><br>
If the employer says "I had to take on a permanent replacement because I could not obtain a temporary replacement", that is a proper matter to consider. It by no means follows that the woman will be denied her reinstatement right in those circumstances, but one can visualise circumstances in which the tribunal would certainly want to take that into account.<br><br>
One option for the employer is to shift the replacement, but there are difficulties if the employer has promised permanency in the job. An alternative is to continue the replacement in the job that has been promised on a permanent basis and to offer some suitable alternative job to his original woman employee. But we believe that matters have to be left as flexible as possible, and the right way to go about that is to leave the tribunal to determine whether it was reasonably practicable for the original job to be offered back and not to exclude from its consideration questions turning on the engagement of a replacement. We believe that amendment No.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1243</span>
152 can be dealt with in that way.<br><br>
Section 56A(2), which is the second subsection that we are considering, covers all employers, not merely those who are very small and to whom section 56A(1) applies. There is already provision in section 45(3) for an employee not permitted to return by reason of redundancy. I should like to remind the Committee of that section:
<br><blockquote><p>"If an employee is entitled to return to work in accordance with subsection (1),"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the section of the 1978 Act which deals with the right to return to work—
<br><blockquote><p>"but it is not practicable by reason of redundancy for the employer to permit her so to return to work she shall be entitled, where there is a suitable available vacancy, to be offered alternative employment with her employer (or his successor), or an associated employer, under a new contract of employment complying with subsection (4)."</p></blockquote>
It continues, in the terms that I have already quoted, to say that the new contract of employment should be suitable in various respects.<br><br>
Therefore that provision already exists in section 43 concerning an employee not permitted to return by reason of redundancy. It was felt that there was no need to disturb that provision. Accordingly, section 56A(2) deals with all cases other than redundancy when it is not reasonably practicable for the employer to permit return to the former job.<br><br>
Although I appreciate that it is not easy to follow this rather complicated clutch of amendments and the arguments about them when we are dealing with them all together, and although, plainly, it is convenient that we should do that, for the reasons that I have given the Government do not feel able to accept any of them. We believe that in no case is any of them needed. When they are matters other than of drafting, we believe that the purpose of the clause, which I explained earlier, does not permit us to accept the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In considering this retrograde legislation, the Opposition believe that, when the Under Secretary makes his bland assertions, it is reasonable to ask for his evidence. On clause 11 he has not even attempted to give any evidence. Previously he relied on the Low Pay Unit. I am certain that he is sorry that he did so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. Facts, not opinions.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1244</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman may have given a hostage to fortune. As my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) showed when he quoted quite extensively from the unit, it made a relentless and remorseless case against clause 11. I shall read only the first two lines, which sum up its attitude:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Employment Bill's proposed changes in maternity provisions constitute a serious weakening of existing rights, particularly for women working in small firms."</p></blockquote>
So its view is absolutely clear.<br><br>
The Under Secretary said that he was not on the mailing list for briefs from the Equal Opportunities Commission. But I am certain that he saw its popular publication with the large headline, "Government told: 'Women in small firms must have same rights'." So its position is clear, too.<br><br>
When the hon. and learned Gentleman referred to the ORC poll, he skated over it by saying that it was a bran tub. I assume that he means that there was something in it for everyone. That was rather glib, because on this point ORC was specific. It drew attention to the fact that very few women availed themselves of the right. In fact, during one year, out of some 10 million working women only 11,600 availed themselves of the right. That is less than one-third of 1 per cent. of women of child-bearing age. So we are talking about only a few cases.<br><br>
The ORC report said that, of those polled, only
<br><blockquote><p>"4 per cent. had experience of holding a job open for 40 weeks for a pregnant woman and 2 per cent. had given maternity pay. None of these respondents said that compliance with these provisions had caused them difficulties."</p></blockquote>
6.45 pm<br><br>
Where is the evidence? There is no evidence at all. We have all heard about the emperor who wore no clothes. It seems to me that the Under Secretary is standing before us stark naked, save for a minuscule anecdotal figleaf. I find his pose completely unconvincing.<br><br>
I am glad that the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) has returned. He very bravely stepped into the breach and provided some anecdotal evidence. The Under Secretary referred on Second Reading to his postbag, but he has not managed to dredge up a single letter in relation to these provisions. I invite hon. Members opposite to read out
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1169">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1245</span>
any letters that they have received. I have allowed a solemn, pregnant pause, but there seems to be no response. I do not believe that there are any letters. There is no evidence at all.<br><br>
I turn to the hon. Member for Chippenham who bravely tried to pose as some kind of villainous Victorian employer, the kind of chap who, if one of his girls—Marjorie, by name, I believe—came to him and said " Please, Sir, I have become pregnant", would say, " Right, that is it. You have the sack. Never darken my door again".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Needham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I never suggested anything of the sort. It is a matter of the greatest concern to me if any of these ladies ever becomes pregnant because the whole company comes to a grinding halt. Believe me, that is the point to which the hon. Gentleman should apply his mind. But he refuses to do so. It is absolutely crucial importance that the relationship between the lady concerned and the company is as amicable as possible and continues for as long as possible, because the lady concerned has to hand over to somebody else. She is unlikely to do that if she is to get the sack and be thrown out. Of course, that does not happen. The whole thing is done on an amicable, reasonable basis. The hon. Gentleman will no doubt be pleased to hear that Marjorie actually had shares in the company. She came along and discussed the matter with us. That is the practical basis on which these things happen. It has nothing to do with Queen Victoria.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that reassuring intervention. I was sure that the situation was not as we imagined. Having listened to the hon. Member for Chippenham, and having got to know him to the extent that we have, any suggestion that that would be his response is quite ludicrous.<br><br>
We understand that there are difficulties with small businesses. The hon. Member for Chippenham was praised by the Under Secretary for his experience in that area. We understand that if one person is missing, the firm might come to a grinding halt. One wonders how the firm has got on without his good self. Presumably, it has not actually ground to a halt. That is the evidence for the value of Marjorie. Clearly, she is far more important to the firm than the hon. Member for Chippen-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1246</span>
ham. I am therefore quite certain that he would value Marjorie. The idea that he would treat her in so cavalier a fashion is clearly far from the truth. If he really were some kind of Victorian villain, with moustachios twirling, and so on, Marjorie would never have taken up employment with him in the first place. She would have known that she was entering a dangerous area, and that should she become pregnant, she would get the sack.<br><br>
I hope that I give no secrets away, but during the Division in the House, I saw the hon. Gentleman sitting outside with a lady of child bearing age. Despite the construction that could have been put on some of his previous remarks, I am sure that that would have had no biological effect upon her. However, I believe that she is employed by him. Jam quite certain moreover, that if she were to tell the hon. Gentleman that she had become pregnant, he would not sack her. That piece of anecdotal evidence was not at all convincing. As my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) said, it is a question of balance.<br><br>
A few firms in Crewkerne and Yeovil—I used to go to Yeovil market years ago to buy and sell cattle, believe it or not—and other areas where there are not many agencies may have difficulties. But the vast majority of small businesses are in cities. The question before us is whether we should deal only with the tiny percentage of small firms in obscure parts of the country where they have never heard of temporary agencies, and where there are villainous employers. Are we to legislate across the board merely for the sake of that tiny percentage, thus taking rights away from working women throughout the rest of the country? It is a question of balance. I do not think that there is enough evidence to justify the law being changed in this reactionary way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I get away from these country matters, and ask the hon. and learned Gentleman whether I heard him aright or misunderstood what he said about amendment No. 154? I had the impression that he was suggesting that it was superfluous or redundant because of the provisions of paragraph 20 of the schedule. I may be mistaken. However, I should like to make it clear that paragraph 20 does the very opposite of what the amendment seeks to do. It inserts into the Bill that which we consider should be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1170">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1247</span>
left out. The amendment says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The size and the administrative resources of the employer's undertaking shall not be considered when determining the reasonableness of a dismissal under this section",</p></blockquote>
whereas paragraph 20 of the schedule seeks to import in respect of the special parts of the I978 Act dealing with maternity and unfair dismissal the words that the Government put into clause 5—we objected to those words at the time—which deals with the change in the onus of proof.<br><br>
If the hon. and learned Gentleman says that I have misunderstood him, I shall readily accept that. It is a rather technical and complex matter. However, if he sticks to what I understood to be his point, I am bound to say that I consider that he has got it wrong</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This seems a convenient moment for me to deal with that question. Perhaps I was less clear than I ought to have been when dealing with amendment No. 154. I do not criticise the right hon. Gentleman, certainly.<br><br>
Paragraph 20 of the schedule is material here. The intention of the amendment is to add a new subsection, subsection (2), to section 56 of the 1978 Act. The effect of that new subsection would be to create an exception to the new provision in section 57(3) of that Act made by clause 5 of the Bill and by schedule 1(20).<br><br>
May I expand a little on that? The amendment would remove from the clause the provisions which relieve very small firms with five or fewer employees from the obligation to reinstate an employee after her maternity absence where this was not reasonably practicable. In addition, it would require industrial tribunals to take no account of the size or administrative resources of the employer when deciding the reasonableness of a dismissal where an employer refused to allow a woman to return to work after maternity leave.<br><br>
The amendment would remove one of the purposes of the clause. It would also limit the effect of clause 5, which requires industrial tribunals to take into account
<br><blockquote><p>"the size and administrative resources of the employer's undertaking"</p></blockquote>
when deciding the reasonableness of a dismissal, by expressly preventing industrial tribunals from taking those factors into account when the dismissal is a refusal to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1248</span>
allow a woman to return to work after maternity leave.<br><br>
The amendment would make an insertion to the same effect as amendment No. 134, which we discussed earlier. It partly removes the drafting error in that amendment, but it still fails to reconstruct the remaining parts of new section 56A. I hope that that explanation, and the consultation that the right hon. Gentleman perfectly properly had with those who advise the Government, have served to make the matter clearer than I did in the course of my remarks on the group of amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I wish to refer briefly to the remarks of the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham). I should not have dreamt of suggesting, as I think my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) did, that he was in any sense a wicked Victorian employer. I think that the complaint against him was rather that when the fair Marjorie became pregnant his attitude was rather paternalistic.<br><br>
However, the hon. Gentleman seemed to suggest that employers take on temporary members of staff in these circumstances without explaining to them that they are temporary. If they do so, one can only say that they are behaving in an irresponsible and even dishonest way. But, equally, there is no reason why the employer and the employee should not come to the cosy arrangement that the hon. Gentleman described. The employer and Marjorie can sit down together and come to an amicable arrangement. If that is so, why should the law be changed? There is no need for change. Everything is perfectly all right.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman pointed out that there is a substantial difference between what the Government are now proposing and what they proposed originally in the consultative document. We recognise that that is so. The figure has dropped from 20 to five. One would be churlish not to acknowledge that that is a considerable advance. But, despite that, I must say that, when the hon. and learned Gentleman talks about wide support, we are left in precisely the same position we have been in throughout our debates on these two clauses. That support simply is not evident.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman referred to what was said in the Con-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1171">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1249</span>
servative Party's election manifesto about employment prospects and employment legislation. The point is, of course, that nowhere in the manifesto did the Conservatives spell out the changes that the Government propose to make in respect of maternity benefit. The hon. and learned Gentleman knows full well why they did not spell them out. They did not do so because they were worried about the women's vote. Quite dishonestly, therefore, they hid their intentions from people who otherwise might not have supported them at the polls. It was as simple as that.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman mentioned the Massachusetts research. I do not want to dwell on that. I say only that this is a matter of interpretation. I do not think that the interpretation he placed on that research is now acknowledged as correct. It was only the initial reaction to the research.<br><br>
I suggest to my tight hon. and hon. Friends that there is no reason whatever why we should not maintain our position on these amendments. I do not think that anything that the hon. and learned Gentleman has said has suggested that we should change our view. He talked about the two tiers. He himself acknowledged that that was not desirable, but he said that when one was seeking particular objectives they sometimes pulled in opposite directions. We appreciate that.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman talked also about employment opportunities as being the Government's preferred choice in this matter. I understand the difficulties here, but he has not at any stage been able to give us any assessment of what all this really means in terms of employment opportunities. I accept that that would be a difficult thing to do. But there is no piece of research of any sort that the Government have been able to refer to, so far as I am aware, which gives us any indication of what the effect on employment opportunity might be. There are no estimates of any kind.<br><br>

I am indebted to my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker)</span></p>

<p>for passing to me a document which he says it is perfectly reasonable for me to quote. It was advice that was given to my right hon. Friend at the time of the Employment Protection Act which put the legislation on the statute book that the Government seek to amend.</p>
<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman has made much of the advice that he has received, the same advice that we were given as a Government by the Department of Employment. That was when the present Government, then in Opposition, were proposing to exclude from the requirements of the Act, employers with fewer than four employees.</p>
<p>The paper that my right hon. Friend has passed to me says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The right is an individual one and it would be wrong to deprive an employee of these rights just because she happens to work for someone who has very few employees. To apply such an exclusion could deprive a large number of women, perhaps as many as half a million, of those rights."</p></blockquote></p>
<p>There is an estimate of how many people may be effected. That was half a million based on the exclusion being four. It would, presumably, be that much more because the exclusion is now five.</p>
<p>The advice concludes by saying that there is no evidence of a small firm's exclusion in any of the EEC countries which operate reinstatement provisions. There is no suggestion that those countries have experienced any great difficulty in operating the provisions.</p>
<p>Whether the same advice is reaching the Under-Secretary now is a matter which he perhaps would not wish to go into. Certainly it is difficult to see why those who are giving advice within the Department should now be taking a different line about the effect. So it seems that the hon. and learned Gentleman is not only out of tune with the weight of the evidence on that matter but is almost certainly overriding the advice he is having from his own departmental officials.</p>
