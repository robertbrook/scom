<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>COMPANIES BILL [LORDS]</h1></div>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Companies Bill [<i>Lords</i>] the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.—[<i>Mr. Parkinson.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis), may I say that there are several hon. Members in the Committee, and gentlemen among the Minister's advisers, who have been round this course before. I hope, therefore, that we shall be spared too much repetition of what took place on the previous Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with your predicament in that regard, Sir Stephen. It was a predicament that I was spared, as I was dealing with another Bill at the time, when a number of hon. Members who are present today were rehearsing a series of arguments with which you are now wholly familiar.<br><br>
It is not the Opposition's intention to oppose the sittings motion or to hold up the Bill. We do, however, have a number of anxieties about the Bill, and the sittings motion provides me with an opportunity to rehearse those problems and to seek some particularisation from the Government on how they intend to deal with these issues.<br><br>
We face an extraordinary situation, embarking on the Committee stage of a Bill that is far removed, evidently—certainly as regards many important issues—from the Government's intentions. We have been promised that the Government propose to introduce a substantial number of amendments dealing with the duties of directors, conflicts of interest and so on, and, most importantly, the issue of insider dealing. However, none of those proposals is yet before the Committee. I can hardly recall a situation during the nine years I have been in the House when a Committee has been presented with a Bill in this shape.<br><br>
The truth is that the Government have got themselves into a mess. Originally,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
they were contemplating a truncated form of the Labour Government's Companies Bill, which would incorporate parts I, II and III of that Bill, and they were adamant on not shifting from that position. In another place the Government then resolved that they would make some amendments which met points raised by the Opposition in another place but which clearly did not go far enough. However, there they stood at that stage, determined not to move an inch from that point.<br><br>
We then had the debate on Second Reading. The Minister of State and the Under-Secretary made certain important additional observations about the Government's intentions at that stage. It was dressed up with the excuse that they had intended to have a Bill later in the Session in 1980 which would have incorporated many of the issues that both sides of the House regard as important.<br><br>
That did not square with the statements made in another place by Government spokesmen, because they were then talking of a Bill in the 1980–81 Session, but it is for the Government to address themselves to the excuses that they want to proffer to Members of the House and of the Committee. It is not for me to embark on a major debate on that aspect at this stage, because I welcome the Government's change of heart.<br><br>
I pay tribute to the Minister of State for the way in which he has caused his Department to rethink its original stance. I have already made certain comments on that on Second Reading, and I believe that the Bill as we eventually see it should be a substantial improvement on the present text.<br><br>
Therefore, I say at once, for the reasons that you have already anticipated, Sir Stephen, that the Opposition see little cause for debating at any length the Bill as presented to us now because it substantially incorporates parts I, II and III of our own Bill. But there will be some interesting debates. I am delighted to see that the hon. Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) has successfully tabled amendments and new clauses to be debated shortly on the question of audit committees and non-executive directors. We welcome that because it will provide the Government with an opportunity to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0010">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
say something more about the state of their consultations on the issue—a matter to which I alluded on Second Reading.<br><br>
I should like to know at what stage the Government propose to put before the Committee the amendments on the vital issues of insider dealing, duties of directors and so on, because it is right that the Committee should have an opportunity to consult about these matters, just as the Government have taken that opportunity. This is not just a one-sided transaction. We therefore demand the maximum possible time within which to carry out those consultations.<br><br>
If it is clear that we are likely to have a fairly short Committee on the Bill as it now stands, do the Government propose to introduce the amendments on Report? If so, it is essential—I am not making a party-political point because we all want to see the right company law reforms enacted—that the Government should permit hon. Members on both sides of the Committee to have a sufficient gap between Committee and Report to undertake further research and take advice on the propositions which the Government are advancing.<br><br>
At the moment the Opposition are handicapped in tabling amendments. I do not want to put down needless amendments if I achieve only a duplication of what the Government intend. Therefore, I shall wait until the Government put forward their proposals in the main, save that, as the hon. Gentleman indicated on Second Reading—this is at col. 61 of <i>Hansard—that</i>he did not propose to bring forward clauses dealing with the codification of duties of directors, we shall do so and provoke a debate on that interesting topic.<br><br>
I wish to refer to insider dealing at this stage, but without going into the merits of the Government's consultative document. How long do the Government now envisage that the consultation is likely to take? What prospects are there of bringing forward amendments within the period of our sittings in Committee? The Minister of State indicated on Second Reading that he hoped to be able to bring forward proposals during Committee. I am doubtful that he will succeed in that, particularly if the Committee stage is not of long duration.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
It would be helpful also if the Government were to spell out now their intentions on other matters of significance so that we can consider separately, or with them, further ways of improving the Bill. I was interested to note from the Under-Secretary's speech that the Government have abandoned the idea of a standing advisory committee to undertake a continuing review of company law and to provide the Secretary of State with both general and specific advice. I am sad that it was abandoned because it was a proposal widely welcomed in financial and professional circles. The proposal that the Government are now putting forward is infinitely less satisfactory, that is, for a departmental panel of advisers. While I applaud the choice of Professor Gower to advise the Government—I can think of nobody better—my doubt about the mechanism chosen by the Government is that our proposal would have enabled a public debate to take place following the proposals for reform that the standing advisory committee would have produced. That now seems to have been thrown out of the window.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend suspect that this may be done possibly for partisan reasons, as part of an attack upon bodies which savour of quangos rather than for any good technical reasons on the nature of the advice that might be given?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I made that point on Second Reading and the Under-Secretary sought to resist it with this other proposal. However, I do not believe that I should embark too much upon that because I want to invite the Government to be constructive in their response, and if I twit them too much about quangos they may not be.<br><br>
I want to know from the Government—this is very important in determining the attitude that we take in Committee on this particular issue—whether they envisage that they will make public, through reports to be tabled to the House of Commons or through some other way, the advice that is tendered on company law reform by the panel of advisers. If they do not go so far as that, we shall have to consider putting down amendments.<br><br>
I want to know also whether the Gov-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0011">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
ernment have any plans to amend the long title of the Bill. I say that because a rather extraordinary position has developed. The long title is very wide and it enables extensive debate to take place, of course. It is to deal with company law reform at large. Our Bill had a different long title in that it enabled a consideration of the amendment of
<br><blockquote><p>"the law relating to companies"</p></blockquote>
and also amendment of
<br><blockquote><p>"the law relating to the fees chargeable in respect of the registration of business names."</p></blockquote>
I find it extraordinary that that fairly innocuous part of the long title of our Bill should have been omitted from this, because there would have been no controversy about that. We welcome a strengthening of the business names registry as a way of assisting small business men, consumers and others who have an interest in prosecuting claims or defending actions, and I believe that the possible abolition of the business names registry would constitute a passport for fraud on a substantial scale. Therefore, we should like to know whether the Government—they would have our full support in this regard—contemplate the possibility of introducing further amendments which, I understand, would require an amendment to the long title of the Bill, to accommodate that objective.<br><br>
After all, as I said on Second Reading, it is absurd that the business names registry should be involved in continuing loss simply because the fees which were established—in 1916, I believe—have not since been amended. It costs 25p to register a business name and 5p to carry out a search. For a Government who believe in saving money to accept that continuing loss for no good reason is palpably absurd.<br><br>
Another matter that I hope the Government will be able to comment upon is the practice of window dressing. Do they propose to put forward any proposals here in Committee to deal with something that has become an appalling abuse? It is in the main a practice designed to subvert the purposes of the Companies Act in ensuring a true and fair view of balance sheets and profit and loss accounts, and it is a practice which has been highlighted in a number of reports as being thoroughly disreputable.

fidence in the City and our financial institutions, and I want to know whether the Government have any plans to check that abuse by legislation. If they have, it is vital that they publish those plans soon so that the Committee and the House of Commons may consider them. If not, what are their proposals? Are matters to be left solely to the accountants' profession to devise a better and higher standard? If so, we shall want further particularisation of the grounds for resisting legislative action.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
Another matter which I raised on Second Reading, and about which I should like the Government to provide us with further and better particulars of their intentions, relates to something that was raised by the present Secretary of State when we debated the Second Reading of the Labour Government's Bill. Talking about minority shareholders, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We need to give a prescriptive opportunity to shareholders to vote in general meeting when the directors seek to dispose of substantial assets without reference to the owners of those assets"—[<i>Official Report,</i> 20 November 1978; Vol. 958. c. 951.]</p></blockquote>
I have a good deal of sympathy with the view then expressed by the Secretary of State, and I think that our proposals fell short of what was required. I should like to know whether the Government have any plans to act on what is, as far as I can see, the only positive contribution that the Secretary of State has made in the debate from November 1978 until the present, and whether on this occasion he will not be resisted by the Minister of State.<br><br>
It will be interesting also to ascertain from the Minister when he replies whether he or his officials have studied the proposals of the Ontario Select Committee on company law which dealt with that specific issue, and which seemed to me on balance to provide a rather better way out of the difficulties affecting minority shareholders than either we or the current Government have so far devised.<br><br>
I think it most unfortunate that the Government could not make up their mind much earlier on the sort of the Bill that they were to propose to the House of Commons. Instead, as I have said, they went through a whole series of mental somersaults. In the end we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0012">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
may arrive at a far better Bill than they had contemplated, but while some progress appears to have been made I feel that the Committee is terribly handicapped at present. I am sure that the Minister of State will recognise the force of that argument because he is a reasonable man—as, indeed, is the Under-Secretary and all hon. Members on the Government side of the Committee—perhaps not quite so reasonable as those on this side, but never mind. While we look forward to having some interesting debates on a number of other important topics, I think it right to take this opportunity to probe the Government's intentions further, and I hope that their response will not disappoint us.<br><br>
The last question that I raise is of a much more mundane character. It is to take up a point that the Minister of State made, either about the sittings motion or very early on in the debate on the Labour Government's Bill, relating to the Christmas Recess. I hope that, if it looks as though we shall not be able to complete our debate before Christmas—I trust that that can be avoided—it will be possible for the Government to indicate at an early stage, so that hon. Members may make their arrangements for that period, that the Committee will not sit during the week immediately preceding Christmas.<br><br>
I hope that the Government will give a positive response to the points that I have made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that I can keep myself in order, Sir Stephen, by thanking you and your advisers at this early stage, though not because I want to cull your favour later, for the form in which your very helpful statement of proposed selection of amendments has been produced. We frequently find at the top of such statements the phrase " all Government amendments", without any grouping of them.<br><br>
The list that you have put before the Committee is extremely helpful, Sir Stephen, in that it groups the Government amendments and enables us to follow what is happening. It will thereby speed up the proceedings, and therefore I am in order in speaking about it on the sittings motion.<br><br>
Sir Stephen, I hope that you and your advisers will continue this extremely helpful practice.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can be brief, Sir Stephen, because most of the ground I hoped to cover has already been covered by my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis). He adopted a helpful and conciliatory tone, and I hope that the spirit in which he opened this morning will be reflected in the Government's response to our proposals. Clearly, most of the Bill will not be controversial in the party sense. It is a Bill on which all members of the Committee will seek to achieve improvements, and it is in that sense and spirit that we shall address ourselves to the work of the Committee.<br><br>
In following my hon. Friend, I seek to elucidate further certain particulars of the Government's intentions. I accept that is a somewhat unprecedented Bill and that many of its more interesting elements are yet to be seen. All will, we trust, be revealed at stages of our proceedings as yet undetermined.<br><br>
It is interesting to note how unwilling the Government were to accept amendments in Committee and on Report in the House of Lords and to see now that there has been a welcome change of mind, although not nearly as far as we would have liked. I suspect that in part the Government's difficulties are self-imposed in that originally we were told that this was a technical Bill and that a more interesting, and possibly more controversial, Bill would be introduced later in the Session. The Government's difficulties arise in part because they have not indicated to the House the real motive for including in this Bill some of the more controversial elements. The real motive, one suspects, is that of pressure of business in the House, and it would have been helpful if the Government had said that at the outset. But be that as it may; we must accept and welcome the concessions that have been made.<br><br>
Clearly, the question of insider dealing will be one of the more interesting features of our debate. In an astonishingly complacent note, the Institute of Directors has already given a qualified welcome to the draft proposals, so one suspects that these proposals are innocuous in the extreme and that, self-regulation having proved manifestly insufficient, the Government have not risen to the chance of allaying the con-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0013">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
siderable public anxiety at this and other areas of abuse which have been revealed by a succession of inspectors' reports. But we shall turn to those matters later in our debate.<br><br>
The key issue, which was posed by my hon. Friend, is that the Government have made known in the consultative document their draft proposals on insider dealing. Clearly, the consultation process is now taking place, and a number of organisations have already made known their reactions to the draft proposals. At what stage do the Government envisage that we in Committee will have the benefit of those proposals in their final form? It is possible given that we shall meet twice during the week, that we shall make sufficient progress to conclude the Committee stage or be in sight of concluding it by the Christmas Recess. Will the Government then at least accept the difficulty, from the Opposition's viewpoint, of giving a reasoned response to their final proposals? On the information now available, when do the Government expect to give the Committee the benefit of their proposals on insider dealing, given the possibility that the Committee stage might be concluded by Christmas?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As one of the survivors of the long and important Committee on the previous Government's Companies Bill, which bears so many similarities to the present one, I should like to say how pleasant it is to all here this morning, but particularly to myself, to find you, Sir Stephen, in the Chair once again. I believe that your presence will ensure as amiable and fruitful a Committee on this Bill as we enjoyed on the last one.<br><br>
The particular question that I wish to put concerns the Government's intentions. Amendments were moved to the previous Bill which were accepted in spirit by the Government at that time, and promises were given that amendments would be introduced on Report. I fancy that there were a number of cases where concessions were made in Committee on the previous Bill which do not appear to have been repeated in the text reprinted by the present Government.<br><br>
It may have been thought that that was due to shortage of time or lack of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
opportunity for consultation. However, this Bill has been through its Lords Committee stage, where one might have expected that if amendments were on the way they would be introduced in accordance with the all-party agreement reached earlier in the year. Therefore, I would ask my hon. Friend to tell us whether it is his intention during this Committee to introduce amendments which will fully implement the agreements reached during the earlier debates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Trade (Mr. Cecil Parkinson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could my hon. Friend give one or two examples of the sort of thing that he has in mind?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be glad to write to my hon. Friend. I think that within his department there must be records of occasions when concessions were given. I am probably not the best source of data, although I shall be glad to help so far as possible. But if, as I think I can confidently assure my hon. Friend is the case, there are parts of the Bill as it has been reprinted which both sides agreed earlier in the year should be amended, may we have an undertaking that, during this Committee, amendments will be introduced so that the Committee may see the import of them and give them reasonable attention?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I join those who have spoken already and say what a pleasure it is, Sir Stephen, to serve once again under your Chairmanship. It is a pleasure which will, I think, lose nothing for either of us if it is rather less prolonged than the previous one.<br><br>
I thank the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis), who spoke for the Opposition, but I should clear up one misunderstanding that he and his hon. Friends seem to share. There was no mess and no confusion as to how we arrived at our present position. I said quite openly on Second Reading that we had hoped to have a major Bill in this Session, not only to deal with parts IV and V of the old Bill but also to bring in the changes which will be necessary as a result of the EEC fourth directive.<br><br>
We found that the period needed for consultation was longer than we had originally thought. The Green Paper is a very considerable document and the professions want time to think about it.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0014">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
Therefore, we found that it would have been rushing things to introduce a second Bill this Session. After discussion, we came to the conclusion that it would be more sensible to incorporate as much of parts IV and V of the old Bill into the present one as we could manage. This Bill in its present form, as my hon. Friends demonstrated by the number of amendments that they have already tabled, offers us considerable scope for work. There is plenty to be done on the Bill as it was introduced into the House of Lords.<br><br>
We said on Second Reading that we wished to come forward with new clauses and new proposals on a range of subjects.</span></p>
<p>11 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman departs from the alibi part of the argument, will he explain why the Government spokesman in another place gave the clear impression—perhaps he was wrong—that the Government were contemplating a Bill not in this Session but in 1980–81?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government's position is exactly as I have stated it. We had intended to have two Bills in this Session, but that has not proved possible. Therefore, we have decided to go ahead and introduce a number of new clauses. Here I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's position. We had all wondered why he had not tabled any amendments. We knew that it could not be for lack of assiduity, because we know that he is a very hard worker. I am glad that he has cleared up the little mystery of why all the amendments on the Paper were tabled by the Opposition.<br><br>
We accept that the hon. Gentleman, and the Committee, should see the proposed new clauses as soon as possible. We shall therefore introduce the new clauses on loans and conflicts and the other areas of directors' duties next week. They will be tabled and will appear on the Paper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the Minister will clarify one point. I have looked at the Paper, and the amendments seem to have been tabled by the Government, or by Government supporters, not by the Opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am still adjusting to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
our change of position, Sir Stephen. But I find that I am becoming accustomed to it quite quickly. Indeed, I find that I enjoy it, and infinitely prefer it to the other job.<br><br>
The new clauses on loans and conflicts will be introduced next week. Those on insider dealing will be introduced as soon as possible, but that will not be within the next week or 10 days. I assure the hon. Member for Hackney, Central that consultations are proceeding very satisfactorily, that we accept that it is our duty to let him see those new clauses in their final form as soon as possible. We intend to introduce them during the Committee stage. We believe that the proceedings of the Committee will flow quite naturally, and that by the time we have finished our work on the Bill as it now stands and made progress on the clauses that we are introducing, there will be time for consultation on our proposals on insider dealing.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned one or two other matters, including the standing advisory committee. He was sorry that we had not carried out the previous Government's proposals. I can only say that I note what he says. We shall have a panel of advisers. I am glad that the lion. Gentleman shares my admiration for Professor Gower. It is not intended to publish the work of that panel. The panel will be advising the Government, and the Government will be giving their considered responses to the panel's work. The result that will be revealed will be the Government's thinking, in the light of the recommendations of the panel of advisers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a point of great importance. The Minister is saying that the Government will be able to grasp and consider the advice given by the advisers, but the public will be no wiser for it. That is a significant departure from our proposals, which were designed to operate as a stimulus to public debate on a subject which is all too often neglected for long periods. I therefore ask the Government to reconsider their position. It would be acceptable to us if the Minister were to say that, although the Government would rather not have the standing advisory committee that we suggested but prefer to operate on the basis of a panel, the advice proffered by the panel
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0015">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
will be made public so that all may consider it and contribute constructively on this important theme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I add to that? The Minister has said that he will not publish the recommendations of the panel. Therefore, he will not stimulate debate. Perhaps he will say why. Would it be considered potentially embarrassing to the Government? On what possible basis are the Government denying to the public information which could stimulate non-partisan discussion in an area where it is particularly required? What is the motive for failing to give the public the advice which comes from this body?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members should not seek to reconcile our proposals with their own. They are different. There is therefore no point in merely complaining that they are different. We have a different approach. We do not believe that there should be a standing advisory committee. We believe that the Government need access on an ad hoc basis to a panel of advisers, and we have appointed Professor Gower as our special adviser on company law. We are therefore simply making arrangements to have available a panel of advisers who will help with our company law proposals. Hon. Members are right. We have abandoned the previous Government's proposals.<br><br>
I shall think about what the hon. Member for Hackney, Central has said. He has made a fair point. I make no commitment, but we wish to be helpful and to have a useful discussion. I shall think about what he has said and write to him about our thoughts on this matter. I shall explain our decision, whatever it is. I hope that the right hon. and learned Member for Warley, West (Mr. Archer) will find that satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Archer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, and I do not wish to prolong the debate unnecessarily. However, I think that it would help the Committee if he could explain at this stage just what is the mischief attached to publishing Professor Gower's recommendations. What is likely to be confidential, and what will happen if the public come to know about it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Advice has just ar-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
rived from on high, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman noticed. The main point is that the Government are not setting up a body which will produce reports which would be suitable for publication. That is not the intention. The Government are arranging to have access to a panel of advisers. The work of such a panel does not necessarily give rise to written reports on a range of subjects. That is the difference between us. The previous Government wished to set up a standing advisory committee. We want to set up a panel of advisers. As hon. Members know, not all advice is reduced to writing. Advice may be given in a number of ways—round-table discussions, meetings, and so on. But the hon. Member for Hackney, Central has made an important point. We shall give thought to it and I shall write to him.<br><br>
I turn briefly to the matter of the long title. We have no plans to change it. It would be a difficult operation, if it were possible at all. We have no plans to do so. We accept that criticisms could be made with regard to the registry of business names. We are working on proposals for that, but the work is not yet finished. It would therefore be pointless, even if it were possible, to try to amend the long title, because our proposals on that matter are not yet ready.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hackney, Central mentioned window dressing. He mentioned it also on Second Reading. That is an important subject. We have no plans to introduce it into the Bill. However, were a decision to be taken to deal with it, I suggest that it would fit more naturally into the next Bill, which, as the hon. Gentleman knows, will deal with the whole question of company accounts.<br><br>
With regard to the Ontario Select Committee, on the principle that honesty is the best policy I must tell the hon. Gentleman that I do not know of its work, but I shall find out. I thank him for mentioning that. With regard to the Christmas recess, I note what he says. If we work as I believe this morning has shown that we can, that may well be a subject of purely academic interest. I therefore would not wish to give any kind of commitment. But, again, I note what the hon. Gentleman has said.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0016">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) raised the question of clauses and amendments which were accepted by the Committee on the old Bill and which would have been introduced on Report. I shall look into that to see what we can do to accommodate him. I agree that our facilities for doing that research are greater than his.<br><br>
I hope that we can now proceed with consideration of the Bill. The hon. Gentleman opened the proceedings in a constructive fashion, and I thank him for that. I am sure that we can do a useful job with the Bill and that it will result in a better Bill. I hope that we can now get on with that work.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful, Sir Stephen, for your indulgence in allowing me to make reference to new clause 10, which, unfortunately, I was not able to complete for the printer until yesterday.<br><br>
New clause 10 reproduces, almost without variation, clauses which I have proposed in earlier years. Therefore, those who are interested in the subject
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
will not find anything unfamiliar in that new clause—which is starred for this morning's business.<br><br>
I am grateful, Sir Stephen, for being allowed to raise the issue of the classification of companies. We are entitled to ask the Minister to clarify the Government's thinking on that subject.<br><br>
The Bill was introduced into the House of Lords in July, but in September it was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0019">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
followed by an important Green Paper which represents in clear terms the Government's recommendations on classification of companies, which are different from the proposals in the Bill. Parliament will be in a similar position to the troops of the Duke of York if, simultaneously with consideration of a Green Paper which makes specific recommendations on classification, we are invited to pass through Committee, and thence on to the statute book, a classification which is at variance with the Government's own recommendations.<br><br>
Clause 1 as it appears in the Bill is inadequate and unsatisfactory. The thinking of all parties, all experts on company law, people engaged in the work of very large, large, small and proprietory companies, and other groups working together for the creation of wealth, is that company law needs to take note of the special forms of organisation which are quite common in this country. If the Committee passes the clause as it stands, we shall show our ignorance of life as it is. I believe that we should make significant changes.<br><br>
In moving amendment no. 93, I draw the attention of my colleagues in the Committee to new clauses 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, which refer to my proposal that very large major public companies should appoint at least three non-executive directors.<br><br>
New clause 9 refers to a new proposal of mine regarding consideration of the appointment of an audit committee. New clause 10 contains my detailed proposals for the way in which an audit committee might normally operate.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
Colleagues will know that I have made something of a study of company law reform. I have done so for this reason. I came to the House in 1968 after 20 years in industry—much of that time in a large multinational company but also a number of years in a small company that was little larger than a partnership but which provided consultancy services to a very wide range of industrial organisations in this country and abroad—and in the course of that work I became convinced that changes were needed in company law if all the excellent people and resources at our disposal for the creation of wealth in this country were to be put to best use.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
The first question we must ask, however, is whether amendment of the law is the appropriate means of encouraging businesses to improve their efficiency. I strongly maintain, for a number of reasons, that it is. First, if we leave companies to find out for themselves how they can best operate, they may in some cases take an inordinately long time, and we need company law so that the laggard, the ineffective or even the incompetent companies are encouraged to hasten to bring themselves up to the standard recognised and automatic in the best.<br><br>
The background of all our thinking on company law has to be the recollection that we have given the immensely important privilege of limited liability. Parliament owes it to investors and to the people who work in companies to ensure not only that the law affecting companies is competent to deal with fraud but that it should also conduce towards efficiency.<br><br>
As I have often pointed out, there has been in this country in recent years, since the Second World War, something that might be called a managerial revolution. Looking back to the way in which company boards were structured before the war, one generally found a majority of the directors to be non-executive. That is no longer so. In very many companies outside banking and insurance we now find that the board consists of the heads of the departments who are regularly engaged in the business and that the board, therefore, has taken on a predominantly executive character, the non-executive element being either no longer present at all or, as in the majority of companies, a minority element, and a rather ineffective one at that.<br><br>
I am not trying to turn back the managerial revolution, but I think that it has resulted in a gap appearing in company law. The supervisory element in British companies is absent or defective in far too many cases, and this deficiency needs to be rectified. Company law must help the parties to work efficiently as well as honestly.<br><br>
In 1969, I introduced my first Bill on company law, which completed its Committee stage. I do not think that it was controversial in principle, but I had to recognise that, in terms of words to be used, it would get longer and longer if it was to serve any useful purpose, and therefore it was not practicable as a Back-Bench measure. The object of the Bill was to provide shareholders with a relatively
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0020">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
easy way of securing a formal investigation in certain cases where they felt that their company was not operating as efficiently as it might.<br><br>
In 1970, I turned to a different recommendation, which was that all major public companies should have at least three non-executive directors. As I said on Second Reading, had I been willing to stop at that point, my Bill would by now probably have become law but it would probably have done little good if it had. The majority of major public companies in this country have one, two or three non-executive directors, so that one would simply have been legislating to call for the appointment of non-executive directors to make up the complement in these major public companies without giving the men so appointed any particular function or standing. Without some additional responsibility or statutory rights, non-executive directors are unable effectively to function in precisely those cases where the non-executive role is important.<br><br>
Therefore, in my Bill in 1970, and in subsequent Sessions, I recommended a further clause which 1 still think is right but which has proved to be a stumbling-block for many people. Before it passes into oblivion, I should like to read it to the Committee—it is only five lines—so that hon. Members may see the drift of my thinking.
<br><blockquote><p>"The non-executive directors shall make a statement annually of their view of the management of the company and the use of the company's assets, together with such information as they consider material for the appreciation of the efficiency and the propriety of the conduct of the company's affairs."</p></blockquote>
If a non-executive director is incapable of rising to the demands that I proposed, it is, I think, doubtful whether he is serving any valuable purpose on the board.<br><br>
To make such an obligation statutory could be a heavy burden if it were interpreted too literally. Some people envisage that this would start an annual McKinsey-type investigation into every company which had been caught by the classification of major public company. That was not my intention, although, since I have mentioned it by name, I should add that I have the greatest admiration for the work that has been done for British industry by that company.<br><br>
We must find a formula, if not that particular one, which enables the non-executive directors, though in a minority
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
on the board, to carry weight with their colleagues. If necessary, some kind of threat should be voiced that unless their colleagues pay more attention to what they say, they will have to carry out some kind of manoeuvre which will draw the matter to the attention of the shareholders, or have some other consequence.<br><br>
In 1976, therefore, following North American practice, I changed my recommendation and suggested that in major public companies there should be a requirement that at least three non-executive directors should form an audit committee. I was encouraged in making that recommendation by the fact that in New York it was made obligatory for every company seeking a quotation on the New York Stock Exchange to have an audit committee. When I was in New York I read the file of correspondence with the heads of businesses quoted in New York—made available by the New York Stock Exchange—about this proposal when it was still in the preparatory stage. I think it fair to say that the vast majority of those important New York businessmen were in favour of the Stock Exchange move, and many claimed that they were already operating audit committees in their companies and believed it to be good practice.<br><br>
Since the operation of audit committees was made obligatory in New York, and because so many British companies have close affiliations with United States companies, the idea has become much better understood here and a number of large companies are moving towards the adoption of the audit committee as a regular feature.<br><br>
Once again, there were a number of people who sympathised with my intentions but believed that to require every major public company to appoint an audit committee might be running ahead of opinion or might be superfluous in a number of cases. On this occasion I have suggested what I truly believe to be the weakest possible formula which could still make the non-executive directors an effective supervisory element on the board.<br><br>
The statement that I ask should be made is provided for in new clause 6:
<br><blockquote><p>"The non-executive directors of major public companies shall make a statement at each annual general meeting of the company in which they shall express their confidence in the executive direction and management of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0021">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
the company and in the way in which the assets of the company are employed."</p></blockquote>
That statement requires only that a non-executive director who has become uneasy about the way in which his company is operated should act on his anxieties or resign. I do not believe that a non-executive director who is not willing even to comply with that stipulation is able to serve a useful purpose on a board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin Stevens</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very sympathetic to what my hon. Friend is saying, but I put this question to him. In practice—I speak as one who has worked near the top of large organisations and who is familiar with the problem he is discussing—unless the audit committee has statutory power to talk to executives below the level of the main board, it is unlikely quickly and easily to uncover the kind of mistakes and errors of financial management that he is talking about.<br><br>
I remember that in one company £1 million was voted by the board of directors on the basis of their reading the wrong papers which had been accidentally circulated and which related to an entirely different matter. On that occasion I spoke to three members of the main board, none of whom wished to take the responsibility of offending the powerful and autocratic chairman. Such a state of affairs is likely to continue unless my hon. Friend's proposed new clause includes a clear definition of those whom the audit committee would be entitled to consult.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has intervened at precisely the opportune moment to enable me to move from the requirements that I am suggesting should be applied to non-executive directors to consider the suggestions I am making regard to the audit committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before he moves on, will the hon. Gentleman clarify one point? It is not clear why he believes that a non-executive director who has anxieties and proposes to demonstrate them should be required to resign as a condition of demonstrating them. If the anxieties are well founded, it is surely not he who should be doing the resigning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am hoping not to achieve a series of open splits but that non-executive directors, within the friendly
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
exchanges in the board room, should be able to make their voices heard effectively and should not always find themselves either deprived of the essential data on which to form an opinion or unable to carry a majority of their colleagues and focus the board's attention on subjects they think important.<br><br>
The sanction I am offering in the new clause is similar to that which company law gives to the auditors. They are able to say to the managing director or the board, if they find something which raises doubts, "Unless you attend to the point we are raising with you, we shall be obliged to qualify our report." That sanction puts the auditors in the position of being able to command the attention of the company. Fortunately, it is only on very rare occasions that they have to carry out the threat.<br><br>
I envisage that non-executive directors would be able to act in very much the same way, in that they could say to their colleagues "Company law now requires us to make a statement on the balance sheet at the annual general meeting that we have absolute confidence in the direction of the company. However, how can you expect us to say that if you are withholding from us things that we feel are important to know, or if you will not pay attention to us on subjects that we think matter. We insist that you should give further consideration to the matter, so that we can be convinced that what you are doing is right."<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
So it is not so much the threat of resignation that is their sanction, but the threat of having, under the new form of the law, to qualify the report that they make to the shareholders. The reason I mention resignation is that in subsection (2) of new clause 6 I say
<br><blockquote><p>"Each non-executive director shall either sign the statement referred to in the above subsection or resign from the board."</p></blockquote>
So it becomes a resigning matter for the non-executive director who cannot obtain satisfaction from his colleagues. He cannot decide to accept defeat and carry on, without making it known to the shareholders that there has been a dispute which has not been resolved.<br><br>
I have given a great deal of attention to the matter. I have consulted very many people and have also tried to draw on my own experience. I believe that it is a work-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0022">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
able formula, but I think that anything less would be too weak and ineffective.<br><br>
I come now to new clause 9. Hon. Members will be able to see at once that I am not suggesting that the appointment of an audit committee should be obligatory even in major public companies. However, I believe that it is an idea which should be kept fresh in the minds of the board, and that it should know that at least once a year it is a matter which may be discussed with shareholders. It seems to me a practical device.<br><br>
No doubt there will be companies where the idea of the appointment of an audit committee will, quite rightly, be abandoned or postponed. But I. hope that institutional investors, in particular, will recognise that this provides them with an opportunity to exercise their influence in a benign way in obliging companies to improve their internal accounting procedures and to strengthen the resources of the non-executive directors.<br><br>
Were new clause 9 accepted—and I think that it would be very difficult for my hon. Friend to explain why it should not go into the Bill—I believe that within a number of years the majority of large public companies would adopt the audit committee routine.<br><br>
As you have been kind enough to say that I may refer to starred new clause 10, Sir Stephen, I should like to make two points in connection with that. First, I am not making it obligatory for the audit committee to be set up. It is merely a matter for regular consideration. Secondly, although I have tried to set out what might be considered the equivalent of Table A—in that it is a standard form in which I believe that the audit committee should operate—I have provided that companies may, if they wish, adopt an alternative form and be able to incorporate that in their articles.<br><br>
I am aware that incorporating changes in those articles will not be an altogether easy matter. However, I do not think that it should be an altogether easy matter for a company that has been required by its shareholders to appoint an audit committee to do that in such a form that it is a sham, or a completely inadequate version of the ideal.<br><br>
I believe that new clause 10, which is, of course, based on Canadian and American practice, as well as on the advice of experts who have helped me
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
with it line by line, is an acceptable standard form. However, I recognise that the Committee and others will want to look at it again before it becomes part of company law. I do not wish to prolong my comments. The Committee has been very patient in allowing me to dilate upon these subjects for so long.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman concludes—if he is moving to his conclusion; from past experience, I am always a little wary when he appears to be moving towards a conclusion—perhaps I may say that he will know that one of my anxieties, although I do not seek to suggest that it is a compelling reason in the mind of a company considering embarking upon having non-executive directors, is that if one has a compliant set of non-executive directors this can institutionalise fraud, deceit and misfeasance, and I believe that there is a danger of that. That was a point made to me, too, when I visited the United States to discuss this matter. As I understand matters, when the hon. Gentleman was arguing this point when the matter was previously before Standing Committee F, he suggested that shareholders—whether the mass of small shareholders or institutional shareholders—had found it increasingly difficult to exercise any sort of authority in the supervision of companies. What sort of authority does he now feel they would be able to exercise upon the choice of the non-executive directors in the face of—to use the phrase of the hon. Member for Fulham (Mr. Stevens), if I recall it aright—the authoritarian chairman of a company who may wish to select the non-executive directors and may get the say-so to do that of the shareholders at the meeting? That is one aspect that worries me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has touched on a serious point. It is one that I shall aim to cover in another new clause or possibly an amendment which will echo an amendment which I moved during the Committee stage of the previous Bill. Before any meeting at which the election of a director was on the agenda, the amendment would require companies to circulate the names of candidates together with some biographical notes. Therefore, institutional shareholders in particular, but also small shareholders, would be able to take a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0023">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
serious look at the merits of the rival candidates and would not merely find that the process of electing a director was a procedural device manipulated by the chairman to secure the choice of unsuitable or ineffective characters.<br><br>
I believe that we have to leave it largely to the shareholders to protect their own interests by seeing that the board contains suitable people to look after and monitor their interests. If even the institutional investors are so morbid or careless that they allow the company to fall into disreputable hands, then there is little that one can do to save them through company law. Obviously, criminal law comes in at the end. However, the shareholders are an element in the mechanism and they must work. It must be made easy for them to work because I believe that the institutions are nervous of intervening and the small shareholders are unable to intervene in all too many cases. One of the real objects of company law is to ensure that all the parties in the process of the creation of wealth are able to function effectively and harmoniously with the others.<br><br>
The point to which I wanted to draw the attention of the Committee is that my definition of a "major public company", that is to say that it must fall within two of the three criteria set out in amendment No. 93, would, I believe, catch only some 200 firms. Therefore, the problem, for instance, of finding suitable men to fill the vacancies that might be created by the proposals that I have tabled would not be insuperable. We are not requiring a tremendous amount of turmoil and upheaval in company after company across the landscape by my proposals.<br><br>
I believe, by contrast, that the approach in the Government's Green Paper, which is to designate the top tier of companies as those with a turnover of £5 million and above, a balance sheet of £2.5 million and above, or with an average number of employees of 250 and above, makes the mistake of confusing large and medium-size organisations with the very large. Very large companies present special problems to which company law ought to attend.<br><br>
The questions, therefore, which I hope the Committee will consider in deciding its attitude to my proposed amendment are these. Should there be any provisions in company law which apply particularly to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
the very largest public companies? Do the very largest companies present features calling for special attention in company law? Should we take any steps to develop British company law along the lines which are generally accepted features of company law and practice elsewhere?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) for his interesting speech. He and I have had the benefit of taking each other's mind on these subjects for a number of years. I think that the Committee and the House—and many outside the House—recognise my hon. Friend as a trail blazer, as a person who develops good ideas and pushes them through, and never seems to be dismayed when he does not win at the third, fourth or even the fiftieth time. He persists in promoting his ideas and, as he pointed out himself, they are being continually refined as a succession of Ministers point to flaws in some of his proposals. He has made the job doubly difficult for the succeeding Minister by removing those flaws, and I must tell him that it is becoming harder and harder—although it is still possible, he will be disappointed to hear—to find flaws in his proposals.<br><br>
However, I congratulate my hon. Friend on his work in this area and on his very high reputation for that work and in particular, his objective in trying to make sure that non-executive directors are not appointed to the boards of large companies merely for window-dressing purposes, to ornament the board, but are people chosen for their skill and knowledge who have a contribution to make. My hon. Friend has spent a great deal of time this morning outlining one of the ways in which he believes non-executive directors can make a most valuable contribution.<br><br>
My hon. Friend knows that I agree with him. I should like the appointment of non-executive directors to become more widespread, and to see those non-executive directors making a more effective contribution. I declare a former interest. Before 3rd May—a very happy day in the history of our country—I was a non-executive director of a number of companies. I had had reservations for some time about how one could play a more effective role on the board of a company which one visited only infrequently. I believe that I was a fairly hard-working non-executive director but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0024">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
I did feel at a disadvantage, and 1 felt from time to time that I should like a clearer role to play.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend knows, more and more companies now recognise that non-executive directors are important and they are appointing them. Earlier this year, following the debates on similar amendments which my hon. Friend had tabled, the Department circularised a number of bodies and consulted them on his proposals. We asked the question "Should there be a compulsory number of non-executive directors? If you think that there should be, should there be an audit committee and do you think that the non-executive director should work on that committee?"—as proposed by my hon. Friend.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
My hon. Friend will not be surprised to learn that there was general support for the notion that we needed more non-executive directors and a feeling that it would be in the interest of companies to appoint them. There was also general support for giving them a wider role. However, there was general and widespread opposition to the idea that such directors should be imposed on the boards of larger public companies.<br><br>
My hon. Friend suggested a figure of three. There was a feeling that perhaps that would create a requirement for which a need has not yet, in the opinion of many, been justified, to insist that every major company, whether it felt that that was needed or not, must have three non-executive directors.<br><br>
The idea that companies might find it in their interest to have non-executive directors, and that that move should be encouraged, was accepted, as was the idea that they should play a more responsible role. However, there was little support for the notion of a specific number being imposed on the board of every company above a certain size.<br><br>
Speaking not only as a Minister but from personal experience, I must tell my hon. Friend that having given the matter a great deal of thought, I do not find it an attractive idea.<br><br>
Also, the Government of the day had consultations about whether the audit committee should, again, be imposed on large companies. As my hon. Friend explained, he has met that criticism and said that he would not insist on that. He
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
believes that it is a subject which a company in a general meeting should be allowed to consider and that it is a matter which should go on the agenda. Therefore, he has moved away from his ideas of a few months ago of wishing to make it a statutory duty of the non-executive director to work on the audit committee.<br><br>
I now turn specifically to the amendment and to the new clauses that my hon. Friend has tabled and which are linked to the amendment. I was going to say to my hon. Friend at this point how pleased I was that he had abandoned one of his ideas in the previous Bill of defining in great detail the functions of the audit committee, the frequency of its meetings and how it should work. However, when I looked at the notice paper this morning, I saw that my hon. Friend had tabled his new clauses. Therefore, I had to strike that compliment from my remarks. However, I shall tell him now what I would have said had he not tabled his new clause.<br><br>
We believe that a flexible approach to audit committees is more sensible than the rather rigid approach of my hon. Friend of laying down in statute what the non-executive directors should do, how the audit committee should function, how it should hold its meetings, and so on. He mentioned today that in drawing up new clause I0 he had taken the advice of a large number of authoritative people. Again, I must congratulate my hon. Friend on the detailed proposals of the new clause. It is obviously the production of an immense amount of work and the distillation of a lot of advice. A new clause such as that does not find its way on to the amendment paper without an enormous amount of effort. I again congratulate my hon. Friend upon the effort he has made in trying to refine his ideas about how the audit committee should work.<br><br>
My hon. Friend talked about the difference between our approach to company classification in the Bill and the Green Paper, and I accept what he said. In the next Bill there will be further reclassification of companies, but we believe that it is more appropriate to make that reclassification at the same time as one is defining the rules governing the accounts and so forth of the companies which are reclassified. We believe that there is no clash at all between the proposals in the Bill and those in the Green Paper. There will be further reclassification in the next
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0025">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
Bill when we bring it before the House, and my hon. Friend knows that the Green Paper is a prelude to that Bill.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend knows, I find his ideas very interesting. I hope that more companies will adopt the spirit of those ideas and recognise the importance of the non-executive director and, perhaps, the role that the audit committee could play in improving the work of the company. Like my hon. Friend, I want to see strengthened the link between the auditor and the members. I shall not repeat some of the speeches I used to make in the previous Committee but I have always found it absurd that the only contact which the members actually have with the auditor, who is their representative, is through the audit report attached to the bottom of the accounts and a glimpse of a representative of the firm if the members turn up at the annual general meeting. That does not seem to me to be a very satisfactory link and I wish to see boards of directors more responsive to the members, the people who own the company and those who work in it. I wish to see that link strengthened.<br><br>
The difference between my hon. Friend and myself is simply the question whether we impose these things by statute at this time. We cannot accept these new clauses this morning. We believe that, again, he has raised a number of very important subjects that should be discussed further. I believe that this is a subject to which we should return on the Floor of the House so that the whole House should have an opportunity to say something about it. As my hon. Friend knows, had the election not intervened we had intended to return to this subject on Report on the previous Bill so that more than the relatively small number of hon. Members able to serve on that Committee could have their chance to have a say on these important matters.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend will not press his amendment and new clauses to a vote. If he will withdraw them, I give him my assurance that I shall join with him in trying to ensure that we return to the matter on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the final words of the Minister of State were very encouraging. I was beginning to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
wonder whether he intended to deal with the substance of the arguments that had been adduced by the hon. Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams), but I believe that he has dealt with them in the best possible way by saying that he will use his best endeavours—certainly, I join with him in that—to ensure that these matters come before the whole House. They are sufficiently important for that and, after all his diligence in providing us with opportunity after opportunity to debate these matters in Committee, the hon. Gentleman deserves to have the attention of the House directed to these important issues. I warmly welcome that proposition. It will mean that we need have a much shorter debate on these points in Committee.<br><br>
Nevertheless, I think that the Committee would wish to hear from the Minister of State something more about the development of the consultations which began when I was Minister with these responsibilities. I know the general outcome because the Minister of State has announced it to the Committee. There is not widespread support for the concept of legislating as regards the appointment of non-executive directors and audit committees. But it would be helpful if the Minister could indicate—not necessarily this morning but perhaps by circular letter to members of the Committee—who was consulted, because it would be interesting to know the credentials of those who advanced replies to these questions. I cannot remember; indeed, I am not sure that I ever found out. But at all events, it would be interesting to know.<br><br>
It would also be helpful if the Minister could give the Committee more particulars of another point he made. He said that more and more companies were appointing non-executive directors. Would it be possible for him to provide us with some details of the development of the concept of non-executive directors amongst major companies over the course of the last four or five years, so that we can see the scale of the advance being made in this respect?<br><br>
At present, it is not enough for the Minister to say that more and more companies are doing that. It is necessary to be able to measure the response that is being made in the direction of the appointment of non-executive directors, because I should be surprised if the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0026">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
Committee was not at one in saying that the idea ought to be embraced. It was certainly our point of view when we published the consultative document. It seems to be the Government's idea also. But is exhortation enough? That is what it comes to. Unless we can be satisfied that there is an effective response—I made this point in a speech in December last—that exhortation is working, we must look more favourably on the hon. Gentleman's idea of introducing legislation.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will be able to respond—not necessarily this morning; perhaps in answer to a question in the House, if he wishes. The Committee would be happy to accommodate him whichever way he wishes to respond.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also said that boards of directors should be more responsive to those who work in companies, and I think that she has again touched a note with which we all agree.<br><br>
I am a little disappointed at the patronising note that is emerging from the CBI conference about the way in which the CBI sees employees fitting into the process of consultation. One cannot be patronising about it. If one is to advance an argument that qualifies the adversary relationship in industry, one must talk from a basis of being equal, because that is what this is all about.<br><br>
However, I shall not develop that point further now. I turn to other matters on which I hope the hon. Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) will be able to satisfy the House when he comes to his other amendment. I refer to the anxiety I expressed in my intervention about the institutionalisation of fraud, misfeasance and deceit because of a group of compliant non-executive directors who are malleable and are manipulated by an authoritarian, dictatorial chairman or group of people on the board. That would be the worst of all worlds. It would be a way of preventing disclosure of matters about which shareholders ought to know. I shall therefore be interested to see how the hon. Gentleman develops that argument.<br><br>
12 noon.<br><br>
There is another matter to which the hon. Member for Kensington referred
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
and about which the Minister said nothing. I hope that the Minister will be able to inform the Committee on this. During our previous discussions we said that we should seek to ascertain from the Stock Exchange whether it would be prepared to emulate the experience of the New York Stock Exchange and make it a condition of the listing requirement that companies should have non-executive directors. That does not have statutory force, but it has a compelling influence on the matter and would touch on very large companies. It is therefore a feature about which we should like to know more. What was the result of consultations with the Stock Exchange in that respect?<br><br>
While welcoming in principle the proposals adumbrated by the hon. Member for Kensington, the Opposition do not see this as any kind of total commitment to the supervision of companies. The mere fact that there may be three non-executive directors appointed, in whatever way—one would hope that it would be in a sensible way which would meet some of the anxieties that I have expressed—is not enough. The Opposition look forward to the development of industrial democracy and two-tier boards where the worker side is fully consulted and where workers participate fully in decisions affecting their working lives. We remain fully committed to that concept.<br><br>
There are, of course, immense difficulties in working that out. I do not pretend that that is not the case or that it will not remain the case. What concerns me is that the Government appear to have swept that under the carpet altogether. So far as we can see, it does not figure on their agenda for this Parliament. That is most regrettable. British industry needs a new look. It needs a situation in which people work together. In an age of technological revolution, it needs a situation in which the worker can feel that he will play a major part in decisions affecting his job, the length of his working life, his job satisfaction, and so on. We shall return to these issues when we reach the later provisions of the Bill. It is most disappointing that the Government have nothing to say about critical issues which will be forced on this country in any event when the fifth directive ceases to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0027">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 39</span>
be a draft directive, as I hope will be the case in the not-too-distant future.<br><br>
Nevertheless, there will be opportunities later in the Bill to debate that aspect of the development of company law. Suffice it to say that the Opposition are delighted with the Minister's assurance that he will use every opportunity to ensure that we shall return to these proposals on Report. We shall support him in those endeavours.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) on this further example of his sturdy individualism, and on the way in which he has battered against the wall for no less than I0 years in this one of his chosen areas of reform—company law reform—as well as in the area of housing policy, where he has made a number of stimulating contributions. He is my own Member of Parliament, so I can monitor his performance in the House of Commons. I make no pledges about anything else, but I shall watch his performance as a Back-Bench Member in the House, although his own individualism may perhaps prevent his gaining his worth and moving a little further forward on his side of the House.<br><br>
The genial and good-natured response from the Minister of State invites the question: What was its true significance? The tenor of the reply was "We agree the desirability of an increase in the number of non-executive directors. We agree with the development towards increasing audit control. We believe that directors should be more responsive. Indeed, we may even believe that there could be greater moves towards industrial democracy"—whatever that means—"We agree with all these things in principle." I do not want to put a false construction on what was said—that because they believe in these matters in principle they therefore accept that there should be greater discussion.<br><br>
But discussions have been taking place for the past I0 years in the House, where hon. Members have given their own views on these important matters. They are accepted "in principle". What does this mean in practice? It means that the deep gulf which exists between his Front Bench and the hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) will still remain. The hon. Member for Kensington believes that these matters should be dealt with not only in principle but should be enshrined in legislation. The Government do not accept that they should be enshrined in legislation.<br><br>
That basic difference of philosophy will remain no matter how long the discussions continue—even if they go on for another 10 years or more. One is therefore somewhat sceptical when one examines a little more closely the response of the Minister of State to this debate. These proposals will again, after endless discussion, run into the sands if the Government persist in saying that there is no scope for legislation. If they persistently say that, how do they expect progress to be made towards a series of objectives which they accept in principle?<br><br>
We all believe in an enormous number of things <i>en Principe</i>—marital fidelity, participating in democracy, and so on. I am not suggesting that marital fidelity should be a subject for legislation, although the hon. Member for Kensington might have some views about that as well.<br><br>
It would be helpful if the Minister could say in what form he thinks developments should be encouraged towards those desirable objectives. We might otherwise be tempted to conclude that his honeyed words are a substitute for real action.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My constituent has been kind enough to point out in so many words that there is a certain difference of opinion—it might be called a nuance—between my hon. Friend and myself as to whether we should proceed with my legislation. For a grim moment, until his closing remarks, I had a vision of him vanishing into that cocoon prepared for Ministers in the Department.<br><br>
Our company law evolved in the nineteenth century and up to the 1948 Act was an example to the world. But after that Act, it suffered a relapse and entered into a know-nothing, do-nothing period. It seemed almost impossible, but there was a suggestion that the Minister had been absorbed into this old Board of Trade tradition which has not done this country's company law too much
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0028">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
good. However, in his closing remarks, he showed that he was willing to keep the issue alive, and that is as much as I could possibly ask. Indeed, I am delighted that this will not be merely a Committee subject but can be debated more widely.<br><br>
Finally, I make the point that it is not really good enough to hope that people will do right and not actually to spell it out in the law. If my hon. Friend's arguments this morning were extended a little further, it would be a case for abolishing table A, for instance, which is the absolute foundation of our company law, on the ground that if one leaves people to find their own way most of them will probably make a good job of it. But the reason for legislation is not to correct the practices adopted by the best firms but to ensure that those who are less than good match the example set in the better organisations.<br><br>
The code of practice syndrome shows a lack of confidence on the Minister's part. If we rely simply on code of practice, we catch the firms which do not need to be caught because they are behaving as they should, whereas those in which there is trouble or a potential problem are the very firms which are likely to decide that the code of practice does not apply to them.<br><br>
As for outside directors, firms which see the value of a supervisory element have already got effective outside directors. They function perfectly well within the context of the board. They are not a disruptive element but a valued one and, of course, they are found in many companies. But the companies that hit the headlines all too often, because inefficiency has taken its toll or, perhaps, following malpractice or fraud, are the very companies in respect of which some change in the law is the only means by which Parliament can protect the shareholders. My hon. Friend must think further about this, because at the moment his attitude is—I am bound to use the adjective—unconstructive.<br><br>
As for consultation, I realise that a number of people were invited at the instance of the previous Government to express their views on my earlier proposals. But what I am suggesting this morning is significantly different from that which I suggested even a few months ago. I emphasise here not only
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
the point which I dwelt on in my opening remarks, that I have so much weakened the provisions that I have had in mind, but the fact that the catchments area is so much smaller.<br><br>
I have chosen the designation of "major public company" with some care. I may have confused hon. Members and my hon. Friends in my last Bill by having two separate categories of large public company, and the wider of those definitions did, I suppose, catch some hundreds of firms, but the definition that I have chosen here, which is certainly subject to further debate, would, I believe, catch only about 200 firms which obviously would be very large organisations.<br><br>
I wonder whether the consultation which was inaugurated by the last Government was spread into a much wider field. I think that it probably was, and that if the discussion had been aimed simply at the proposal in regard to about 200 very large organisations a different result might have been achieved.<br><br>
I also have to ask myself whether the consultations were held with the right people. If one goes round this country's prisons and ask the inmates whether they think we ought to have a police force, they may well say that they think it could be improved if it was made a voluntary body. or something of that kind. If one asked the executives who, after the managerial revolution of which I have spoken, have taken command in the board room since the war "Do you think your work would be improved if you had more supervision?", obviously there would be many who would feel that their work could not be improved and that, if they are to have non-executive directors imposed on them at least they must be powerless and ineffective people—retailers of smoking-room stories, Stock Exchange gossip and suchlike—and not the sort of people who are likely to make any difference to the way a company is run.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
Therefore, I hope that, if there is to be further consultation about my proposals, shareholders' representatives—the City, the unit trust managers and those who have to dispose of the nation's savings in large companies—will be able to express their point of view also.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0029">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 43</span>
Among that group we should find a powerful majority in favour of some action being taken by the Government on broadly the lines I am recommending.<br><br>
I shall be very glad to use the time between now and Report to improve and amend the recommendations standing on the Amendment Paper this morning. I thank the Minister for his forthcoming conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think it would be polite if I commented briefly on the remarks of the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis). I shall write to him to let him know who was consulted. I hope he will not criticise the list, because I think he probably drew it up.<br><br>
I did have available figures on non-executive directors, but I have probably mislaid them. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman on that matter also, and let everyone have a copy of the figures.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman raised the question of boards being responsive to their workers. I think he was not right to use the adjective "patronising". Everybody wants to find a way of getting labour and management to work more closely together. The only question is, how can it best be done? Is it best done by companies experimenting as they are now in a variety of ways? Should it be imposed by legislation? We prefer to see the experiments. We prefer to see industry go about this problem—which it recognises as a problem—in its own way. It was quite wrong to use the word "patronising".<br><br>
The question was canvassed whether it should be made a condition of listing on the Stock Exchange that there should be non-executive directors and audit committees. Again the answer was "No". On the whole, people felt that it was not a sensible requirement to make.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot simply say that. The New York Stock Exchange is quite as eminent as the Stock Exchange in London, and it has found that it is a perfectly sensible arrangement to make. For the Minister to skate away and say that it is not sensible is really not good enough. He must particularise more about it. Perhaps he cannot do so today because he does not have the information in front of him,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
but I have no doubt that his officials, knowing them as well as I do, will be able to provide further information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point I was making was that the Stock Exchange in London takes a different view from the Stock Exchange in New York. Both are autonomous bodies and our Stock Exchange takes the view that it would not improve the company from the point of view of the members, or be in the interests of the listed companies, if it were to impose that condition.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Swansea, East (Mr. Anderson) said that it was not good enough to agree in principle but not to impose. I remember listening to debates in the House of Commons about trade union law when exactly the opposite view was put forward—that these were not areas in which one could change attitudes by changing laws. It is an argument which, when it suits them, Labour Members use quite often.<br><br>
Progress is being made in this area. If, for instance, someone was in the business of getting round the requirements of my hon. Friend's proposals, he could satisfy the requirement by picking three stooges and putting them on his board. Making sure that every public company had three such non-executive directors would not automatically ensure that all these benefits would flow. It would not necessarily be the protection that my hon. Friend suggests. We are both in the business of making companies more responsive. We are simply having a discussion about how to achieve that end.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I were to accept the criticism and concede that I had been wrong in the past on that subject, will the hon. Gentleman concede something in return? Why does he deny voluntarism in the trade union sector but think that it will work in the company sector?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a good question. It is one which occurred to me as I started to give my example. My hon. Friend the Member for Kensington pointed out that he has refined his ideas even in the few months since the last Bill. He has indicated the immense amount of work that he has done and will continue to do. I thank him for his willingness to withdraw the amendment this morning. I repeat my assurance to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0030">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
him that I shall do everything I can to ensure that those important subjects are debated where they should be debated, on the Foor of the House of Commons.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister was kind enough to intervene after I attempted to withdraw my amendment, in order to prevent the Committee from being forced by pro-</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can be surprisingly brief on amendment No. 94 and new clause 8.<br><br>
The purpose of amendment No. 94 is to allow the Minister to say a few words to the Committee, and the Committee to exchange ideas with the Minister, about the proposal in the Green Paper that a third tier of companies should be incorporated in company law—that is, that we should specify particular rules for proprietory companies. As this proposal was so effectively put forward by my hon. Friends in the Committee on a previous Bill, I thought it would be of service to this Committee to have their amendment reprinted.<br><br>
New clause 8 embodies the principle of my hon. 'Friends' recommendations for lightening the burden which might otherwise fall upon the 'proprietary companies. I do not wish to advocate these</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
<p>cedure to move to the vote, I now beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Willams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 94, in page 1, line 20, at end insert:</span></p>
<p>"proprietary company" means a company limited by shares in which each of the directors is a shareholder, each of the shareholders is a director; and none of the shareholders is a company which is not a proprietary company; and in which two of the following criteria are applicable;
<ol>
<li>the amount of its net assets, as shown in the latest balance sheet at the conclusion of the annual general meeting (taking account of any distribution to shareholders or employees approved by that annual general meeting) together with the net assets of any other proprietary company or companies of which any of its directors is a director, is not greater than £650,000.</li>
<li>the number of its employees other than directors does not exceed 50.</li>
<li>The annual turnover in any of the last three accounting reference periods of the company, did not exceed £1,300,000.".</li></ol></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take new clause 8—<i>Proprietary companies' audit</i>—
<br><blockquote><p>"Where the notice of the annual general meeting of a proprietary company states that the auditors intend to sign a certificate at the conclusion of the meeting in accordance with section of this Act (Proprietary companies auditors' certificate) if the resolutions to be proposed at that meeting are carried, and that one of the resolutions to be proposed is in the form set out below then the auditor's certificate shall be accepted by the registrar in satisfaction of the requirement for an auditor's report in accordance with the Companies Acts, provided that the resolution set out below is passed at the annual general meeting with the support of the holders of not less than nine-tenths of the shares represented at the meeting. The resolution shall be as follows:
<br><blockquote><p>'Resolution: the auditors of Proprietary Limited having given notice to this meeting that they intend to sign a certificate in accordance with section of the Companies Acts, this meeting resolves that no audit report shall be required by the company in respect of the accounts for the year to provided that such certificate is duly signed within one day of the end of this meeting.'".</p></blockquote></p></blockquote></span></p>
<p>proposals personally, as I believe that a number of members of the Committee could do so more effectively than I. I hope that it will be thought that I have served a useful purpose in drawing attention to the Government's Green Paper, to the debate in Committee last year, and to the real and urgent need for something to be done to lighten the burdens on small organisations.</p>
<p>I should point out the only difference that I have made in reprinting the proposal put forward by my hon. Friends in the earlier Committee is that I have changed the classification to conform with the bottom-tier classification recommended in the Green Paper.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must point out to the Committee—even to Ministers—that if no hon. Member rises in his place, nothing stands in the way of my going on with the business.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Reginald Eyre)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Sir Stephen. I thought that my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, East (Mr. Bright) was seeking to be called, but he probably did not realise that he had to rise in his place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They do things differently in Luton.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams), to whom we are all grateful for a brief speech presenting his amendment and the new clause, indicated his support for the idea—it is a most important principle—that the burden imposed upon small companies should be eased wherever possible. In replying as briefly as possible to the points that he raised, I must point out that his proposals would introduce into the Companies Act a more restrictive definition of proprietary company than is proposed in the Green Paper "Company Accounting and Disclosure", Cmnd. 7654, and there is the further extremely important consequence that new clause 8 would enable this proposed new and restricted class of proprietary company to dispense with a full statutory audit.<br><br>
The need to relieve small companies of unnecessary legislative burdens is a central objective of the Government's policy. I cannot emphasise that too strongly. Therefore, we have put in the Green Paper proposals for relieving small companies from disclosing unnecessary financial information in their annual accounts. The options we have put forward go to the limits permitted in the EEC fourth directive on company accounts. I emphasise the importance of that to my hon. Friend. We have defined proprietary companies in a broad manner in order to apply the benefits of reduced disclosure to as wide as possible a range of small proprietary companies.<br><br>
We are, as my hon. Friend knows, asking for views about whether proprietary companies should be relieved of the requirement of a statutory audit. The accountancy profession last week published a consultative document under the title "Small Companies—the need for Audit?", which will help to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
focus the debate on this important issue.<br><br>
My hon. Friend's proposals on proprietary companies are therefore certainly topical, but I do not intend to argue against them this morning because the Green Paper makes clear that the Government have an open mind on the question of suggestions for further measures of company law reform which would help to relieve small companies of unnecessary burdens. Already we are receiving suggestions, including radical proposals for a new form of incorporation for small businesses which would go much further than the ideas for a proprietary company put forward by the Government and by my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington.<br><br>
We intend to consider all these proposals when preparing the next Companies Bill to be introduced in the I980–81 Session of Parliament. The Government will consider my hon. Friend's proposals in the light of the wider response to the debate on whether small companies should be relieved of the statutory audit requirement and, if so, what, if anything, should replace it.<br><br>
The debate on this subject is important. Many people see the statutory audit as a useful and necessary precaution for all companies and their creditors, while others claim that the audit of small companies is difficult and expensive and does not serve the purposes that it is intended to fulfil.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
Up to now, the debate has been largely conducted within the accountancy profession, but I hope that we shall now hear the views of small companies themselves. We are seeking those views and also those of bodies such as banks, other financial institutions and credit agencies which use small company accounts. This wider debate has only just begun and it would therefore be premature to legislate on the subject in this Bill. I hope, therefore, that on the assurance that his proposals will be fully considered in preparing the 1980–81 Bill, and that that Bill will contain a definition of "proprietary company", my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington will agree to withdraw his amendment.<br><br>
I return to the point I made about
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0032">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 49</span>
the definition of a proprietary company. In deciding on a broad definition of "proprietary company", the Government took account of the criticism of the definition that was inserted in clause 1 of the 1978 Companies Bill by the then Opposition. Those criticisms centred particularly on the requirement that each of the shareholders must be a director and each director must be a shareholder, which my hon. Friend has included in the definition contained in amendment No. 94.<br><br>
That restriction eliminates about half the small independent companies which would qualify as proprietary companies under the Government's definition in the Green Paper. I am sure that that fact will affect my hon. Friend's view of the matter, because I know that he shares our enthusiasm for lessening the burdens on small companies and for widening such benefits as much as we possibly can.<br><br>
Therefore, on the ground of that definition and of the assurance that I have given my hon. Friend on the question of audits, which will come forward for serious consideration in the 1980–81 Bill, I repeat my request that he consider withdrawing his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to enter into the merits of the argument at any length. I merely want to elicit some information from the Minister concerning the consultations that he has embarked upon with regard to the issue that has been the subject of this short debate.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman will recognise, of course, that small businesses are not really a homogeneous entity with which one can enter into consultations. How, then, does he propose to solicit their contributions to this discussion? Who will he consult, apart from the professions, the CBI and possibly others? I am particularly interested to receive some sort of response from the Minister on that matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Bright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. We (must recognise the tremendous difference that exists between a company such as ICI and a small family chemist's shop or manufacturing chemist. The requirements are obviously widely different for the two, particularly
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
in respect of auditing and company accounts and reports.<br><br>
Many thousands of small companies force a farcical annual general meeting upon themselves, when perhaps a few members of the family meet, have a drink and then listen to the auditor's report. They are simply going through the motions; all are fully aware of everything that is happening in the company. It is possible that the information that they have to hand is even more up to date—in fact, it must always be more up to date—than when the report was produced.<br><br>
I believe that that makes rather a farce of things. If we can recognise the need to take away some of the burden of legislation from small businesses, we can allow them to get on with the task of manufacturing and creating new jobs for people.<br><br>
Therefore, I welcome what the Minister said in his reply, but I hope that when consultations take place they are with genuine small business people. I hesitate to suggest that the CBI does not represent small businesses, but I believe that perhaps it has more of an ear to the larger companies than to some other organisations. I hope that we shall talk to those people.<br><br>
I do not intend to take more of the Committee's time. I support what is now proposed, and I emphasise that if we are to look further at the matter we must talk to small business men. I have been involved in small business for many years. Although my stature does not mark me as a small business man, that is what I am and I hope that I may lend my advice to the Committee in its further deliberations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Sir Stephen, for giving me the chance to move from my position at the other end of the room during the last Companies Bill Committee to this end of the room and still enjoy the benefits of your Chairmanship.<br><br>
I support the thinking behind the amendment which, of course, is that drafted by the able duo on the last Companies Bill my hon. Friends the Members for Gloucestershire, South (Mr. Cope) and for Maldon (Mr. Wakeham). However, it seems to me that there may be difficulties in the amendment vis-à-vis the fourth directive.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0033">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 51</span>
I have no doubt that the Minister is aware of what I see as a conflict between the two.<br><br>
I wish to deal with two points. First, why I believe we must have a category of proprietary companies, and second, the question whether a statutory audit is needed. I believe that today we regard our company law system too much as a series of preventive rules and that we should apply the test of what is the effect of those rules upon business. I wonder whether it is still true of our company law system, as was said in 1906, that the company system, inaugurated by the Act of 1862 which started us on this road, has given an immense stimulus to commercial enterprise. I believe that that in still a test which we should apply to company law.<br><br>
In practice, there is an enormous distinction to be made between companies where the shareholders and the directors are the same people and other companies, even if they are small private companies, where the shareholders and the management, who are normally the directors, are different. For years we have indulged in bureaucratic overkill in applying far too many rules and by applying the principle this was done by the last Companies Bill—that what is good for public companies should be applied across the board. Therefore, I very much welcome the Minister's remarks and hope that he will carry forward those ideas in the next Companies Bill.<br><br>
My second point concerns whether a statutory audit is needed for proprietary companies. Under the fourth directive we have the option which is set out in the Green Paper. I want to add my voice to stiffen the Government's backbone so that they choose the lowest level of requirements for the smallest categories of companies. Of course, exempt private companies did not file accounts at all prior to 1967, and I do not believe that the law was then changed in response to widespread abuse; nor in other countries are small companies required to file accounts.<br><br>
I believe that there are five essentials to an audit. First, the auditor should have official status. Second, there should be a body of audit practice. Third, there should be a means of verification.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
Fourth, there should be independence of auditors. Finally, there should be a report.<br><br>
The truth is that today many small companies are not properly audited in accordance with that prescription. There is an increasingly used form of auditors' "report" on small companies which reads to the effect that regular accounting procedures have not been followed in a company and therefore the auditors are unable to express an opinion.<br><br>
There is no sanction for such a nebulous and useless comment. In my experience as a solicitor in private practice—an interest I should declare—I have often found that it does not cover up any form of iniquity or anything that is wrong; it simply shows that the auditors have not done the job of auditing. Indeed, for the reasons I have given, I believe that in many cases it is unnecessary for them to carry out that job.<br><br>
What is happening is that a paper with the name "audited accounts" is being filed and we are enforcing the filing of that paper, but the paper itself bears little relevance to what is happening in the company and is not of great use to those who are dealing with the company.<br><br>
Who will be damaged by statutory audits not being prepared or filed? Certainly not the employees. They are protected in many ways which we discussed on Second Reading. The shareholders are generally not affected where they are also the directors. Given the additional rights that they are to get from the Bill, I do not believe that the shareholders would be prejudiced, either.<br><br>
Trade creditors and third parties, such as banks, who deal with companies do not rely on audited accounts. They are published far too late and contain far too little detail. Such people rely on a much closer involvement with the company for their security and the information that they depend upon. Almost invariably they take personal guarantees from the shareholders or directors—or both—of the company.<br><br>
Nor does our friend Her Majesty's Inland Revenue depend upon audited accounts. It is the practice that the Revenue sends detailed questionnaires to the company and its advisers.<br><br>
I conclude by saying that statutory audits are necessary for ICI but not for the tobacconist's shop. We should en-

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 53</span>
courage people to start up businesses, but present requirements are a disincentive to individuals to do that. I welcome the wider definition contained in the Bill. I hope that the Government will apply the minimum of auditing requirements set out in the Green Paper in compliance with the fourth directive. On that basis I, and people who advise small businesses, can have great confidence.</span></p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary's remark that it was a central objective of Government policy to relieve small companies of the burdens of company law shows the justification of my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) in tabling amendment No. 94. I leave for the moment the new clause which is being discussed with the amendment and concentrate on the amendment itself. If we took that amendment alone, it would merely be declaratory that certain companies should be called proprietary companies. That is as far as it would go.<br><br>
I would not go as far as my hon. Friend does in the first paragraph of the amendment, which restricts the term "proprietary company" to those companies where the directors are the shareholders and the shareholders are the directors. As the Minister said, we can extend the definition further than those companies. If we restricted it in that way, that would cut out about 50 per cent. of the small companies from benefiting from the relief.<br><br>
Let us suppose that there were in the Bill a declaratory clause stating what proprietary company" means. As I have said, I would skip the first paragraph and take the criteria proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington in his amendment—which are the same as in the Green Paper, Company Accounting and Disclosure":—and define the proprietary company merely by reference to turnover, balance sheet and the average number of employees.<br><br>
Then we should have a definition of a proprietary company in the Bill. We could then be given, as we continue our discussions, statements from time to time of the items in company law which would not in future apply to proprietary
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
companies. Indeed, there is an indication in the consultative document of those items. It mentions how the fourth directive seeks to relieve small companies by making the distinction between accounts which have to be drawn up and those which have to be published by reference to the abridged balance sheet and abridged profit and loss account, and in respect of several matters concerning disclosure where the proprietary company could be relieved of the technicalities—which in many cases is all that they are—of the whole of company law as it applies to a small company.<br><br>
Mention has already been made of the relief of the requirement for strict audits. However, there are, of course, other matters of which I should hope one could relieve the small company—for example, that they would be allowed to repurchase a proportion of their equity capital. Therefore, if we put in the Bill at an early stage a definition of a proprietary company, it may he that either now or at a later stage we shall be able to introduce at least some of those simple measures, rather than wait another two or three years for them to be put into a Bill that embodies the fourth directive.<br><br>
I should like to make a further suggestion arising from the amendment—that it might not be necessary even to use primary legislation for the relief of small companies, having defined them, from certain items of company law. The House might be prepared to leave the Secretary of State to relieve the small company by affirmative order, which might well be provided for in this Bill.<br><br>
I am trying to put into the Bill as much reform as can reasonably be done at present, without having to wait for yet another Companies Bill. In the not inconsiderable time that I have been in the House I have seen many Companies Bills postponed again and again. We have had them in draft; we have even gone through their Second Reading; and we have seen them go through one House and not the other. I fear that something may yet again happen before the fourth directive is ever embodied in a Companies Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before referring to the many interesting points that were raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0035">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
Crosby (Mr. Page), I should like to mention the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, East (Mr. Bright). As he knows, the Minister of State, other Ministers and I enthusiastically endorse the importance of the point that he made about relieving the burdens on small businesses. We are completely agreed on that approach.<br><br>
I assure my hon. Friend that there will be genuine consultation on the matters he mentioned. We are already advancing along these lines and we are willing to talk to small business men about their aims and objectives. Coming from the west Midlands, I have very strong views on these matters and a close connection with small businesses, so I assure my hon. Friend that he need have no apprehension on that score. The Government will certainly do all they can to engage effectively and genuinely in the consultations with the aim of improving the situation for small businesses.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) asked with whom the consultations regarding small businesses were proceeding at present. The consultations on the Green Paper include the Association of Independent Businesses, the National Chamber of Trade, chambers of commerce at regional and national levels, and with the Confederation of British Industries smaller firms council.<br><br>
Turning again to a point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, East, I emphasise that we are also most anxious that we should listen to the individual voices of small business men and we have had some helpful correspondence in this regard. People have written to us giving their views. Therefore, I assure my hon. Friend that we are intent on making the very best use of the process of consultation with the idea of picking up useful ideas from wherever they may come. I feel sure that he may be absolutely content that we shall continue that process.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Baker) referred to a point regarding the fourth directive, where there is an element of difficulty, which we appreciate. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for the strength of his support for the Government's views on proprietary companies. He went on to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
express some very strong views on the question of audits affecting small companies, for which I am grateful, and I have taken careful note of his points. He referred to the position of exempt private companies before 1967 and emphasised how much extra information is now demanded of those companies.<br><br>
There is no doubt about this. We take the view that a wrong balance has come into existence, and we intend to correct that balance in favour of the small companies. I noted that, from his practical experience as a solicitor, my hon. Friend was able to express views on audits which affected not only companies but credit organisations. I believe that the area into which he began to move is very important, and therefore it is an important part of our process of consultation, for we are anxious to collect views on it, too. My hon. Friend's points are noted with appreciation.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby referred solely to amendment No. 94 and went on to exclude, virtually, the first paragraph. I am grateful to him for accepting the point that was made about the restrictive nature of that paragraph. Having thus heavily amended the amendment, my right hon. Friend went on to ask if it was possible to introduce a declaratory clause with the purpose of defining small businesses based upon questions of turnover, balance sheets and the numbers of employees. I know that my right hon. Friend will understand that I was anxious to say to him "This will be done; this is the process we are following", because he went on to say "On the basis of such a declaratory clause defining the nature of proprietary companies, would it not be possible to provide a framework of company law, and for other proposals affecting small companies, enabling us to look at the situation of those small companies with the aim of improving them?" Of course, my right hon. Friend was perfectly correct in putting forward that point.<br><br>
As members of the Committee will know, those proposals, precisely as my right hon. Friend put them forward, are part of the consultative document published by the Government. There is no doubt that that document, the Green Paper, has given rise to a great list of matters needing consideration. My right
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0036">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 57</span>
hon. Friend strongly expressed aims which the Government share.<br><br>
Let us look at the present difficulties of the state of company law. My right hon. Friend, when speaking in the Chamber a little while ago, mentioned the difficulties and confusion which, in some respects, affect the present state of company law. We should take that into account, for it is undeniably true, and those matters requiring legislation we are preparing to deal with by organised stages. I ask him to accept that it would not be possible to deal with his requests adequately and properly in this Bill, and I assure him that we are continuing the consultative process, the basis of which is set out in the Green Paper, with enthusiasm.<br><br>
We absolutely share my right hon. Friend's aim and the idea of getting this legislative framework, which will enable us to examine all the problems affecting small proprietary companies against a background of past failure. We would certainly seek a number of beneficial measures which would affect very small companies. I emphasise that what I have said does not exclude the possibility of making progress by way of order in the interim period.<br><br>
We have published a good consultative Green Paper; we are enthusiastically following up the process of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
consultation that comes out of the Green Paper; we wish to prepare extremely good and helpful legislation for introduction in the 1980–81 Session, the earliest date on which we would be able to do it in the organised way desired by my right hon. Friend. But in the meantime we may be able to make some progress by way of order, which we have in mind, and which would accord with the points made by my right hon. Friend. On that basis, I hope that my right hon. Friend, too, will agree that it would be reasonable of me to ask my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) to withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
