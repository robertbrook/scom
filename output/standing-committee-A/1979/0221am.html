	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is intended to supersede the procedures that were established by the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Amendment) Act 1976, which recognised that people who were unfairly denied admission to a union or unfairly excluded from a union should have a means of seeking redress. But the view of the then Government and Parliament, reflecting the views of the Royal Commission, was that these were matters best dealt with by the trade union movement itself, either by the individual union the membership of which was at issue, in accordance with its full rules and procedures, or, failing redress there—which should be the first avenue of redress—within the wider trade union movement. Not least because of the sensitivities, the long-standing traditions and the recognised democratic procedures of trade unions, it was recognised that these matters could be better dealt with by those who understood them, thus more likely avoiding problems which could otherwise arise of difficult inter-union relationships, conflicts between trade unions and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of that was intended to deny the right of the aggrieved individual to seek redress in the courts. So we had a system which, first, sought to provide an opportunity for the aggrieved individual to seek his rights as he saw them within his own individual trade union, second within the broader trade union movement through the machinery of the independent review committee of the TUC, and finally in the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government propose in the clause to remove the role of the trade union
	<span class='label label-info column'>530</span>
movement and to give the aggrieved individual immediate access to the industrial tribunal. In the course of our debates, the Government have not at any time established a need for this change; nor have they shown that the existing procedures are inadequate and not working properly. The Committee rightly twitted the Under-Secretary on his inadequate or abortive attempts to provide arguments and examples to sustain his case. He could not do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to us extraordinary that the Government should seek to add to the Bill these needless bits which cannot be beneficial in their outcome and which can only be seen as provocative to the trade union movement. It is for that reason that I shall ask my hon. Friends to vote against the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One matter that we have not so far adequately recognised is the way in which this clause hangs together with the later provisions which further extend the opportunities for individuals to opt out of the obligation to belong to a trade union. It may be difficult for us to continue to avoid that link when we come to discuss the next clause, but I shall avoid testing your patience by exploring that ground now, Mr. Leadbitter. I rest on what I have said and urge my hon. Friends to resist the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker), I shall be brief. We have had a pretty fair innings on amendments to the clause and we are not left with a great deal to say about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall express some views which are, not surprisingly, different from those of the Government, but before I do that I shall restate what I believe to be common ground among all of us. If we are clear about the common ground, we can examine the differences better. If we are clear about objectives, we can examine methods more intelligently. If we have some meeting of minds on the diagnosis, we can examine more clearly why we differ about the prescription.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first piece of common ground has been stated and restated over and over again—that the best way to solve industrial relations problems is by agreement rather than by law, and that the law is only a fall-back to clear up situations in which the voluntary arrangements do not work or do not work fairly. That puts
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0788">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>531</span>
a limit on how far we want the law to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second matter of common ground is that we are all here today to seek industrial peace, to achieve peaceful industrial relations. We may—and do—disagree about how to achieve that objective, but there is no disagreement on the objective. The Government have brought in the Bill to that end, as they see it, and the new measures to be introduced later into the Bill in one form or another will have that same objective, as they see it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third matter of common ground—the second and third can sometimes be in conflict—is that in a democratic society the rights of the individual are of the greatest importance. An individual who is discriminated against unfairly should have redress. No one is a more passionate advocate of that thesis than I. I suspect that no hon. Gentleman has done more than I have over the years to try to provide a defence for the individual against the unfair operations of the Establishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to match our deeds to our words. One area in which deeds are not being matched to words is that the clause does not match the constant protestation by the Government and their supporters of their belief that industrial problems are best settled voluntarily, if they can be so settled. The hon. and learned Gentleman has resisted all along amendments the effect of which would have been to make the law a longstop rather than the wicketkeeper. They are not practising what they preach when they say that they want to encourage voluntary settlements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that there are times when the principle of maintaining the rights of the individual can be in conflict with other principles. They are not when people are reasonable, but we have to face the fact that some are not reasonable. As I said in the House the other day in a different context on another Bill, quoting an ancient text, we have to bear in mind that we live in the world as it is, and we must organise ourselves in relation to people as they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are quite a lot of unreasonable people about in the world. We all know some of them. There are quite a lot of litigious people about. The more unreasonable they are, the more litigious they are likely to be. Every time I am on a
	<span class='label label-info column'>532</span>
Committee or attending a debate on Report and I read a Bill in any sort of detail, one of the criteria against which I read it is to ask myself whether this or that clause provides an opportunity for the sea lawyer, the chap in every factory who knows all the works rules by heart. He knows all his trade union rule book by heart—and some of them do. If one is a member of the AU EW it is quite a feat to know the union rule book by heart, because it is a fair old rule book. He knows it by heart. He knows all the precedents by heart, and he is ready to run up his flag and claim his rights on all occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You would rebuke me, Mr. Leadbitter, if I tried to anticipate a discussion on the next clause, when we shall talk about the levels of compensation, but may I just say that if those levels are such as to make it attractive for a chap to be litigious, the sea lawyer will operate more and more. It is the sea lawyer, above all, who is the irritant in industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid that the clause will not contribute towards the objective of making the law the longstop rather than the wicket—keeper. But—more seriously—I am afraid that it will not contribute to the objective of industrial peace. I know some chaps in my own union who will look at the clause and say "Goody, goody". Some people seek martyrdom or they seek publicity. It is a pity that it should be so, but it is no good pretending that it is not. There will be some chaps who would like to precipitate an exclusion or an expulsion and get themselves made into a hero by the more rubbishy end of our popular press. Anybody who behaves like that is, for some reason that I. do not understand, treated by some organs of the popular press with only slightly less respect than ladies with little clothes and fulsome proportions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A hero will be made of the chap who gets into a litigious situation in the use of this clause, and I am genuinely worried about it. Not only can I not see it contributing to industrial peace but I can see it becoming a vehicle for the creation of industrial disharmony and dispute action, including quite serious dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will carry the clause because they have the majority to do it, but I think that they will live to rue the day. If they live long enough, they may even seek to change it altogether in the light of the results which will flow from it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0789">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>533</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 3 deals with persons who are unreasonably excluded from union membership and grants them the right to appeal to the industrial tribunal. Is there is any need for this extra apparatus which the Government are creating to deal with cases of people who are unreasonably excluded from union membership? Had the Government brought forward cases showing that the TUC voluntary procedures had fallen down, they might have established a case for the clause, but, as far as I gather, they have never said that the TUC procedures have been unfair or unreasonable or that they have excluded from membership of a trade union persons who otherwise should be members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had reference to the case of a textile worker who was not readmitted to the union because 30 years previously he had refused to carry out a union instruction to come out on strike, in spite of the fact that at that time he was a youth who had just left school and had been working for only a month. The whole trade union movement is outraged when unions adopt that intolerable attitude, and when that case came before the TUC committee the union was told that it must take the man back. There are many other cases where appeals have been made to the TUC, they have been considered and an adjudication has been made that has been acceptable to the parties concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have not cited one instance where that procedure has fallen down and it has been necessary to bring in the industrial court. So we have to consider the basis on which this clause is introduced. Why are people excluded from union membership? In the overwhelming majority of cases, it is because members have dropped out of the union voluntarily by not paying their contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many different rules in different unions. Some unions have a rule that a person is out of compliance when his contributions are eight weeks in arrears. Some unions specify 10 weeks or three months. But after a stated period a member becomes oat of compliance if he does not pay his contributions. This does not mean that he is excluded from the union. It means that he is not entitled to the benefits of the union; he cannot receive strike pay, lie cannot
	<span class='label label-info column'>534</span>
receive sickness pay—which is one of the assets of being a member of the union—and he is excluded from taking part in union activities. Some unions exclude members only at the end of the financial year, at 31 December. So a member could become out of compliance in January or February and not until the end of the year would he actually be excluded from union membership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many members who have a grievance against the union, or against the local officials, protest by withholding their contributions. It could happen that people who would normally, under the rules of the union, be out of compliance or excluded would say "True, I broke the union rules. I am out of compliance; I have not paid my contribution." But that is not the real reason. They would say "I had a dispute with the union. They have not taken up my case properly "—"I have disagreed with the attitude of the union "—" I think that the local branch is run by Trotskyists "—all sorts of excuses can be brought forward for being out of compliance, and these would have to be considered seriously by an industrial tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must therefore consider whether there is any necessity for people to have a right to go to the industrial tribunal if they have been excluded from a union through non-payment of their contributions. In many unions there is no dubiety about the rules. I can remember what happened in my time, although it is 40 years since I joined the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers. My hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) is more up to date on the rules now, but in my time, when I finished my apprenticeship, every new member had to appear at a full branch meeting, before the chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chairman read out a catechism which started "Have you read the rules of the union?", to which the young chap had to reply "Yes, I have." "Do you understand that the rules of the union are—" so-and-so, going into a long explanation. The chair man then made a solemn declaration about the principles of the union, how members had to stand together, how they must help each other, how they were trying to enhance the position of working people, and he would say that, in addition to the industrial activities of the union, the members were endeavouring to build a new society—this was made quite clear—on a Socialist
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0790">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>535</span>
basis. That declaration was read to every new member entering the union. When this little ceremony was finished, the chairman shook the chap's hand and he realised that at last he had left his apprenticeship. He had become a man and had joined the union. It was and is still a solemn occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no dubiety about the need to observe union rules. In the light of the deep regard for union rules—rules that have been applicable in many unions for 150 years—we should not set up another authority, an industrial tribunal, to question the motives of union rules. My hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) gave the example of a Tower Hamlets temperance society which discovered that it had a drunkard as a member. He had disobeyed the rules. I do not for one moment suggest that such a person should be accepted back into membership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that clause 3 is setting up an apparatus that will probably lead to further employment for lawyers, calling in the law in odd cases that could very well be decided on a voluntary basis by the TUC. I warn the Minister that he will step into a quagmire if he goes into this area. There is no necessity to set up a different apparatus to consider questions of admission to or exclusion from a union. The present system seems to work very well. This is one more encumbrance that the Government intend to put in the path of trade unions to make it more difficult for them to operate. The clause should be rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, believe that the Government are stepping into a sticky quagmire, although they may not recognise it at the moment. One can well understand the mentality of the Tory Party in seeking to put such a clause into this misnamed Employment Bill and then use the words "unreasonably excluded" or "unreasonably expelled". The Tory Party has always detested the principles of trade unionism and sought to shackle the trade union movement, which, after all, is a voluntary coming together of men and women to protect themselves in what will occupy the main part of their working life. We see here another attempt by the Tories to go round a track that they have been round many times before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking this clause in context with the
	<span class='label label-info column'>536</span>
rest of the Bill, and listening to what has been said by the Minister in reply to some of our amendments, one would begin to form the impression that some trade unions were in the business of actually refusing to accept members and expelling those they have. The facts are patently the other way round. The trade union movement is in the business of recruiting people to its ranks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its growth over the years, and particularly since the war, the trade union movement has been remarkably successful in recruiting men and women into its ranks. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to claim that the British trade union movement has the highest percentage of those who work for their living within its ranks of all such movements in the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is obvious that the trade union movement has been successful in recruiting members. The issue at stake is expulsion from a trade union. There are few cases of exclusions from a trade union, and they will be so farcical that any application to a tribunal under the heading of unreasonable exclusion, unless the members of the tribunal had gone completely off their heads, would be thrown out within seconds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is almost inconceivable that anyone would be "unreasonably excluded" when he applied for membership of a trade union, unless he had a previous record of expulsion or exclusion from another trade union because of non-payment of subscriptions. As my hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher) said, that is the major issue in exclusions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All trade union rule books are quite clear on this. My own union, the AUEW, lays down quite clearly that when a member becomes eight weeks in arrears he forfeits his right to benefit. I am sure that the Under-Secretary will appreciate in his professional capacity the significance of being excluded from benefit. If one is excluded from benefit one loses the right of legal coverage, which is one of the most significant aspects of trade union membership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that hon. Gentlemen, particularly those who have served in Parliament for some time, have had individuals coming to their advice bureaux and surgeries saying that they had had an accident at work. I have no doubt that the first question that hon. Gentlemen ask is, "Are you a member of a trade union?". If the unfortunate individual says "No",
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0791">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>537</span>
I am sure that the response is "You should have been a member. At least, you would then have had a trade union which would have covered you legally and taken up the case on your behalf."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view, that is one of the points that trade unions do not sell hard enough—that one of the great benefits that they give their members is legal coverage in the event of accident at work. I have no doubt that hon. Members, certainly newer Members, will come across this more and more as their career continues. I give them this free advice. Let them encourage their people to be members of a trade union, if for no other reason than that they will receive coverage. They might also advise them to pay the political levy, but that would be outside the terms of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In subsection (5) we come to the heart of the Government's thinking in the clause and their resistance to our amendment to delete the words after "case" in line 32. Trade unions are run by reasonable men and women. I know that from time to time there is the odd unreasonable case. I accept that completely, as someone who has served in the trade union movement all my life since I started in industry as a 16-year-old. There has been the odd case of very rough justice. But all trade union movements have such a structure that the odd case of rough justice can be quickly sorted out, because of the commonsense basis of the union. Unions would not be able to exist unless they were built on a basis of common sense in accordance with the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the men and women who are members. This is another attempt to put shackles upon the trade union movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that hon. Members will appreciate that we are in serious danger of creating here what we have long suggested that the Tory Party is anxious to create—a blackleg's charter. I have no doubt that the clause would be used by the odd "wide boy" who can be found in any walk of life to make some easy money at a tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problems and troubles will start for the Government if and when the Bill becomes law. With luck, it may not become law. The Government may collapse before the Bill reaches the statute book and we shall be free to have a general election. But that is unlikely to happen in the next two or three months—it will take slightly longer than that—and in the meantime there is a danger that the Bill, including clause 3, will be put on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>538</span>
statute book, I have no doubt that there will be sharp lawyers coming into the picture. I am sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman will not mind my saying that there are sharp characters within his profession, as there are sharp characters in the trade union movement, who will be only too willing to leap in under clause 3 to advise people that there are a few pounds to be made under clause 3. No doubt, the lawyers will make more than a few pounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not like clause 3. We have tried to amend it. It should be taken out of the Bill. As an Opposition should, we have looked at it closely and tabled amendments which would at least have made the clause more reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not wish to be unfair. He must be aware that not only are industrial tribunals at risk in the way that he has described but there are often cases in which people without any case that could be sustained in an industrial tribunal, rather than have it rejected, often assess pretty accurately—with some guidance, no doubt—the likely cost to the employer and settle with him in advance for that sort of sum. In my book, that constitutes something like blackmail. I am sure that, in order to set the record right, the hon. Gentleman would want to take account of that in his remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall need your guidance, Mr. Leadbitter, on whether I am free to go down that road, examining the role of tribunals in all circumstances under the heading of clause 3. If I have your permission to take up the hon. Gentleman's point on the validity of all tribunals, the merits of the individual cases that come before them, and the mental approach of the individuals who apply to tribunals on such issues as unfair dismissal, I shall be happy to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have looked at the amendments and considered how far the debate on stand part should go. I have come to the conclusion that the amendments did not cover the whole principle of the clause. Therefore, it would be reasonable to have a general debate of reasonable length. But I urge the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Leadbitter I apologise if I have tempted the hon. Gentleman. I just felt that, as he had gone down one road, he might wish in all equity to go down the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Chair must not put up direction signs to the various roads that hon. Members might take. I leave it to the hon. Member's judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful, Mr. Leadbitter. I accept the generous ruling that you have given me. I should be only too happy to follow the hon. Gentleman down the road that he has opened up before me. It would strengthen my argument. I was not suggesting that all those who sought to appear before a tribunal for, instance, unfair dismissal were genuine. The hon. Gentleman clearly will not appreciate it, but there are often applicants who seek to involve their trade unions in unfair dismissal cases. After examination by the officials—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was just thinking of Mr. Robinson and British Leyland in that context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise the matter of Mr. Robinson, and I shall do so in a moment. What I was trying to get across to the hon. Gentleman, whose knowledge of the trade union movement is somewhat coloured as we have seen from his efforts at Grunwick, is that many unfair dismissal cases in which individuals seek to involve their trade unions are well screened by the trade unions. A union may well decide not to press a case. The hon. Gentleman may find difficulty in accepting that, but I assure him that many of these cases are taken by district or area secretaries, who often have an even heavier case load than do Members of Parliament. The last thing that they want to be involved in is hopeless unfair dismissal cases. That is why they take a hard look at them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that many unfair dis-
	<span class='label label-info column'>540</span>
missal cases—the Minister will help me on this—can be called frivolous. Only a very small percentage come under the heading of frivolous cases. Let us remember that in some 20 per cent. of all criminal trials the arrested person is found not guilty, whether in the magistrates' court or the Crown court. It would be rather odd to suggest that every case that goes before a tribunal for, for example, unfair dismissal has to be a winner. There would be an outcry in Parliament if we were to reverse that procedure and say that every arrest the police make has to be a winner before it goes to court.

I may be straying a little, Mr. Lead-bitter, but let me just mention Mr. Robinson. He is a member of my union, the AUEW, and I should perhaps call him Bro. Robinson. I am not in the least ashamed to call him Bro. Robinson, because I feet that that man has a long and proud record of service to the trade union movement. For my part, I do not think that the trade union movement made any gains from yesterday's events at Longbridge. I feel that what will be required from all those involved in the trade union movement at that plant, including the management, will be a deep study as to where to go—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Wolfson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member feel that the increasingly important question that trade union members will be asking themselves in the future is whether service to the union membership consists of resisting job changes, thereby not providing opportunities for new jobs in the future? I suggest that that has perhaps been Mr. Robinson's role. and it has not been one which has proved helpful to the membership whom he purports to serve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Wolfson) has suitably intervened, and I have heard the point. The hon. Member who has the Floor has developed his point. Perhaps it would be discrete therefore to leave the case of Mr. Robinson. Both sides have had opportunity for reasonable comment upon it, and to dwell on the happenings of yesterday would not be relevant to the debate on the clause or be acceptable to the Committee. That is my judgment. Therefore, may we now leave Mr. Robinson and proceed with the debate on clause stand part?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the generous way in which you have allowed the debate to go on during the last two or three minutes, Mr. Leadbitter. I have no doubt that there will be later occasions on the Bill when I can return to the theme of Bro. Robinson and to the theme of balloting at the work place, including by a show of hands, as took place at Longbridge yesterday. It is significant that the press has not protested about a show of hands ballot at Longbridge yesterday. It may well be that the press, the Tory party and employers only protest about a show of hands vote when the decision goes against their interests. It is significant that yesterday—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must have missed my point. The ballot that took place yesterday on a show of hands at Longbridge in relation to Bro. Robinson—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot have a dialogue between two hon. Members. If an hon. Member wants to intervene, he ought to stand. May I refer to my guidance—not a ruling—a little earlier? It will not be pertinent or acceptable to the Committee as a whole to have an extended debate on Mr. Robinson, but the Chair knows that members of the Committee have sufficient ingenuity to come back to it as a point of reference from time to time. If the Committee will use its ingenuity, perhaps it will not be led into temptation by hon. Members who, from a sedentary position, do not intervene in the proper manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I am extremely grateful and I beg your forgiveness, Mr. Leadbitter, for allowing myself to be tempted. When a maiden interjection has been made by an hon. Member, one is so carried away with emotion that one tends to forget the rules of order, and one seeks to respond to the point, even though it was somewhat out of order. I hope that you will forgive me, and that you will forgive the hon. Gentleman for going out of order in that intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>542</span>
I merely make the point that it is interesting that on a show of hands ballot we have not had screams from the press, from the Tory Party and from the employers about the disgrace of having show of hands ballots with all the intimidation which is supposed to flow there from. Indeed, it seems to me that the only individual intimidated yesterday was Bro. Robinson in the treatment that he received from people whom he has done his best to serve for many years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not only does there not seem to have been any criticism of a ballot of this sort because of the result that was eventually reached, but I have not noticed any criticism from the Conservative Benches against those who actually threw missiles at Mr. Robinson. I should have thought that that was objectionable practice as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend has been very helpful. Again, it appears that law and order has only one connotation for the Tory Party and when violence is offered the other way Conservative Members of Parliament are as silent as the grave.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to respond to that invitation. If missiles were thrown, it was quite shocking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that the hon. Gentleman's comments will be duly noted. I have certainly noted them. I welcome his comments, and I only hope that more members of his Party, particularly at Prime Minister's Question Time this afternoon, will join in with their condemnation of the lawlessness and dangers that must be involved when missiles are thrown in any situation where there is a large crowd.

I apologise again, Mr. Leadbitter—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So do I.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that my hon. and learned Friend need apologise. It was a very useful intervention and I was grateful for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point has to be made that clause 3 is the bones of the blackleg's charter which those of us in the Tribune movement always expect from the Tory Party. It has a long history of seeking to encourage and incite people to blackleg as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0794">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>543</span>
far as their colleagues are concerned. One of the sad points about that is that Tories do not understand the emotions and hatreds which are aroused by people who blackleg and who scab upon their workmates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman quoted the rather sad case of the textile worker who many years later lost his card for a brief period. As my hon. Friends have pointed out, that was a significantly poor example because the TUC appeals machinery worked to get his union card back. The real issue at stake, as Opposition members of the Committee know only too well, is the deep and bitter feelings which are aroused when people walk through a picket line and scab upon their fellow workers. That is something which Conservative Members do not understand. They cannot grasp the deep feelings which are aroused. Coming from the part of the world that you come from, Mr. Leadbitter, you will be aware that there are still men in the north-east of England, now in their 40s and 50s, who will hear comments in a conversation or a club such as "His father blacked during the General Strike". That is how deep and bitter the feelings go in relation to anyone who scabs upon his trade union colleagues. And this is what the clause is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman said during one of the debates on the amendments that we are talking about a closed shop situation, and that is what the Tory party has always deeply opposed. I suspect that when most employers read clause 3, they will say to themselves, "Oh my god, what is that damned Party up to again?". Here we are going round the same track as with the Industrial Relations Act, when the vast majority of employers agreed with the trade unions that they would ignore the Industrial Relations Act completely. I have no doubt whatsoever that the vast majority of employers, irrespective of the outpourings and briefings of the CBI, will look at clause 3 and say "No way. Not under any circumstances." I appeal even at this last moment for the Government to think again about clause 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Giles Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it is common ground that cases of unreasonable exclusion and expulsion from trade unions are very rare. I think that the Minister
	<span class='label label-info column'>544</span>
said that this was a very small problem. But I do not intend to rest my case on that. Our case is that the voluntary system of appeals against this kind of incident has worked very well. if it had not, I might be sympathetic to the clause. If the Minister had proved that there had been a complete breakdown in the trade union appeal system of individual unions, that the independent review committee had been a complete farce and had failed and that the common law had not worked, I might be sympathetic towards the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But those are not the facts. The voluntary system is working well. The appeals systems of individual unions are effective. They have been improved somewhat over the last few years following the TUC initiative after the Donovan commission report. The independent review committee has proved itself, as the Under-Secretary said during our debates on the amendments, and by acknowledging that there may be some case for inserting a period in which the voluntary system can work, the Under-Secretary is tacitly acknowledging that the voluntary system has proved very valuable. In addition, there is the whole common law protection as a back stop for the efforts of trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that in all these circumstances the Government have not proved their case. The onus on those who want to change the law is to prove that there is a case for doing so. I do not think that the Government have made out that case. They have not come forward with a large number of cases which show that the trade unions are falling down on the job, that the TUC has fallen down on the job or that common law is inadequate. That is why we must oppose the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also oppose the clause. It epitomises the Government's narrow legalistic approach to affairs rather than coping with real life. You said, Mr. Leadbitter, that if one used ingenuity, it was possible to refer to certain matters. May I use one ingenious sentence to refer to matters that have been touched upon, without mentioning the gentleman whose name is in the headlines? We were told by legalistic gentlemen opposite that it was preferable to have postal ballots rather than other ballots. At BL, while our Committee has been sitting, there have been three ballots. Two were secret ballots. One
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0795">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>545</span>
went the "right way" for the Government, the second ballot went the "wrong way" for the Government, and the third one, held in a field, went the "right way" for the Government. What does that prove? It only proves that this narrow legalistic way of approaching matters has very little to do with real life as it is lived outside these precincts, and that some of us who have lived in industry perhaps show a little more common sense on some of these matters. Therefore, I hope that the experience of recent days has been educative to the hon. and learned Gentleman and his Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jocelyn Cadbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has referred to decisions going the "right way" and the "wrong way". It is not a matter of the right way or the wrong way but of what is fair, and of people being able to vote in secret. No one has said that it is a matter of decisions going in the Government's favour or against them. It is a question of having a secret ballot which is fair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know if the hon. Gentleman wants legislation to prevent the sort of meeting that was held yesterday. But I have made my point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am reluctant to intervene, but the question passes through my mind, every time that I hear hon. Members urging the importance and desirability of secret ballots on almost every issue, of why we do not have secret ballots on votes in this House. We have an open form of voting and we put our names on the record for posterity. I wonder what the outcome would be if some of our votes on the Floor of the House—for example, the vote on sub-post office services only the day before yesterday—were made in secret. It might be interesting to hear the views of hon. Members on secret ballots on great issues coming before Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, there are various ways of holding ballots. I am not sure why we should seek to force our views unnaturally on British customs that have stood the test of time. But I am opposed to clause 3 basically because of its animus against the closed shop. The essence of clause 3 is that it is opposed to the closed shop. The case that people have attempted
	<span class='label label-info column'>546</span>
to make against it is that it infringes personal liberty. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) said, there are no greater exponents of personal liberty than those of us on this side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already mentioned one of the major printers in Scotland, D. C. Thomson's, where one is not allowed employment if one is a trade unionist. One has to sign a document that one is not a trade unionist in order to obtain employment. If that case were dealt with, perhaps we should have more understanding of the sincerity of their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we asked the hon. and learned Gentleman to give us cases in which personal liberty was infringed, he was—he will have to admit—embarrassed. I have found him to be the most persuasive and formidable advocate, able to make even a weak case sound strong, Yet on this he floundered. He could not think of a case off the top of his head. He invented a hypothetical ambulance man. When he reads his words he will be rather embarrassed, thinking that what he said was rather unworthy of him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not a fact that even a skilled and persuasive advocate cannot produce a case if a case is not here to support his argument?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely. A case does not exist. If it had, I am certain that it would have been argued persuasively. It does not exist at all. I have given my personal experience of working for 33 years in closed shops and finding no restriction on my personal liberty—rather the opposite. I therefore wonder whether there is something more sinister behind this. Are we looking to a future when there will be numerous appeals and one will want to encourage appeals?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) talked of a blackleg's charter. Are we thinking of cases in which trade unions embark, under their constitutions, on strike action, and individuals can say "It does not matter. I am not bound by the rules and I can do whatever I like."? Is that the sort of situation that the Government want? Is that the real purpose of the clause? If so, it is most unfortunate, because trade unions exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0796">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>547</span>
There are about 5 million trade unionists in closed shops. We have to ask what kind of trade unions we want. Do we want weak and ineffective unions, a proliferation of unions, people being able to opt out of one and into another, or do we want strong and effective trade unions with sufficient resources that employers can negotiate with knowing that at the end of the day the unions can deliver and enforce, as it were, by their own discipline the deal made with the employers? I hope that we would want the latter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I can be subversive for one moment, I should like to draw to the Committee's attention the view of the CBI. We should look at what people in industry think. I can understand that there are people who want to abolish the closed shop or to outlaw it. There is a lot of pressure on the Government to bring in absurd measures of that kind, and no doubt they feel obliged to come forward with some form of words. Let us look at what the practical people in industry say. We were all sent the rather glossy report, rather better than the TUC can manage, about the annual conference of the CBI. There was a resolution on the closed shop, trying to ensure that everyone
	<br><blockquote><p>"…has the right at all times, without affecting their current and future employment, not to join a trade union or to join a trade union of their choice."</p></blockquote>
It was moved by Mr. Richard Puttick of Taylor Woodrow. Even he, in his speech, admitted that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…some employers had agreed to the closed shop, apparently because they had seen it as a working basis for peaceful industrial relations."</p></blockquote>
If an employer comes to such an arrangement with his trade union, why should that not be allowed on a self-regulating basis? The next speaker was a Mr. Graham Turnbull of the General Council of British Shipping. The CBI report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"He said that the British shipping industry operated with a closed shop. He had had no problems and no existing employee had lost his job. The industry was convinced that its present arrangement contributed to good industrial relations and that any changes as a result of legislation would cause considerable and unnecessary upset."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will think twice before he causes "considerable and unnecessary upset" to the shipping industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>548</span>
We then had Mr. Neville Cooper of Standard Telephones and Cables. He was rather against the closed shop in principle. However, the conference report stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…if he believed the CBI policy would, in the long term, be to press for total abolition of the closed shop, then he would withdraw his support."</p></blockquote>
He made that very clear. Then Mr. Clifford Rose of British Railways reminded the conference:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…that the closed shop was nothing new".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is bringing out a most interesting list of quotations, but it all seems to depend on his fear that the clause will be used as a blackleg's charter. I wonder why he has that fear? I do not believe he would argue that the unfair dismissal provisions have proved to be a disrupter's charter in industry, and I wonder why he fears that the same industrial tribunals would be unable to apply the clause equally impartially in the case of unfair exclusion from a union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that question. We have established so far that the existing closed shop arrangements, which have grown up organically within British industry and now embrace about 5 million workers, have not caught any expulsions which have infringed personal liberty. I have explained the case where we expelled a member and a newspaper report condemned us. We made an offer to the management of the newspaper. We said that we would give the man a card provided that the management would employ him. It refused to employ him. Therefore there have not been any such cases in the past—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] If hon. Members will bear with me and listen to a few more sentences from the CBI discussions, they will understand how germane my fears are and perhaps consider these matters afresh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to Mr. Clifford Rose, who said that the closed shop was nothing new. He said that—
	<br><blockquote><p>"it had certainly been around as long ago as 1867."</p></blockquote>
That is long before the hon. Gentleman and I were ever thought of. The article states that in the view of Mr. Rose
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0797">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>549</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"employers should not give so much emotive attention to the subject; the approach should be coolly logical. There was no point in pretending that there was no case at all for the closed shop in the light of the long experience of it in many industries.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Mr. Rose felt that too many people approached the subject of the closed shop from the viewpoint of attacking the unions in the hope that they would diminish and fade away. He doubted if that would happen. It was better, he said, to concentrate on making agreements with unions and then getting them to honour them. This would be made more difficult if, by opposing the closed shop, it created the opportunity for mavericks to make mischief in the union's ranks."</p></blockquote>
If it is said that a man may opt out of one union and join another—if one gives that right—according to Mr. Rose, who presumably has much of practical experience, that will provide an opportunity for mavericks to make mischief. I do not know whether that is what hon. Members would like to see happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The article continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In any case, asked Mr. Rose, did delegates really w ant people to be able to join the unions of their choice, whether or not they were appropriate to the industry. This would lead to an extension of the proliferation of unions which industry already deplored."</p></blockquote>
I ask hon. Members rhetorically whether they want a proliferation of unions. Of course not. Practical industrialists are arguing against the Government. Mr. David Boult of BICC Components was not very keen on closed shops, but he questioned
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether industrial relations legislation was the right place for dealing with it. The legislation proposed in the resolution "—</p></blockquote>
which I have mentioned already—
	<br><blockquote><p>"might give extremists a rallying call against so-called anti-union legislation, and in the mêlée we may lose the great opportunity we have recognised at this Conference.'"</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wolfson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I preface my question to the hon. Gentleman by saying that I am delighted that he has made it so clear that not every member of the CBI—some of the gentlemen that he has mentioned are known to me—are necessarily in agreement with the policy being suggested by the Government. I suggest to the hon. Gentleman—I shall he interested to hear his reply—that Parliament has a role that is over and above that of either employers or trade unions. Ultimately our concern needs to he with the individual. Therefore, our policies here are not necessarily in all
	<span class='label label-info column'>550</span>
instances in line with those of the CBI, nor should they necessarily be so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree completely with the hon. Gentleman. I believe Parliament should be sovereign, above the TUC, above the CBI, above the European Economic Community and above everybody else. This Parliament should be sovereign in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the attention of Conservative Members to the facts of life in British industry, which we should take into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall close on this note out of regard for my throat and hon. Member's patience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend does so, perhaps my hon. Friend will add to what he said just now that, although it is true that Parliament is not bound to take notice of the people with practical experience in industries, every time it has refused to take notice and has gone against that practical experience, its has resulted in aboslute disaster. Ought we not therefore to pay a little heed to that practice now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very wise. We must not live in a little world of our own. We are responsible to people outside. We must keep our links and contacts and listen to advice. At the end of the day, we take the decisions. That is why I am pleased that we are lobbied so frequently, although it is somewhat of an ordeal to face some of the lobbyists we have had recently. It will be an unfortunate day when people do not come here to lobby but to take other measures. But certainly the power should remain here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wolfson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On those very lines, I was delighted to find the very welcome reception given to the proposals in the Bill by industrial relations managers from a wide range of British industry, and the fact that that welcome continues as these discussions go on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I conclude by saying that the debate at the CBI was wound up by Sir Alex Jarratt, who will be well-known to the hon. Member as the chairman of the CBI steering committee on industrial relations. Sir Alex said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"His Steering Group in no way condoned the closed shop and believed that CBI should work towards its elimination in the long term."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0798">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>551</span>
This is what Sir Alex believes. He wants to work towards the elimination of the closed shop. The proposal before the conference and the Government's proposed legislation were simply practical steps that could be taken in the short term on the way to the ultimate objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So there is the truth. The Bill and clause 3, which has been presented as such a mild measure are, in the words of Sir Alex Jarratt—and no doubt he had consultations with the Minister and was given certain assurances—blurted out in public as being the first step to eliminating and outlawing the closed shop. Because I think that is the real purpose, because no case has been made out that existing closed shops infringe personal liberties, and because I think that there is far more behind the clause, I oppose it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before saying a few words on the Bill, Mr. Leadbitter, may I raise what I suppose should be a point of order? Is it possible to have rather more copies of the report of the previous sitting on the table when each new sitting commences? They seem to be going like hot cakes and are not available for all hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chairman is in the same difficulty. That is why I have found the debate rather fascinating. I wanted to know at what time copies of the 	<i>Official Report</i> would be ready. But they are not yet ready.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All our discussion on the clause so far has illustrated a clear division between the two sides of the Committee centering on the fact that, whilst the Government says that they welcome—as we do—self-regulation and job discipline within the trade union movement, at the same time they want the statutory powers, and assert that they will not conflict with the voluntary system. Our argument, which has run throughout our debates on this clause, has been that there will be such a serious conflict as completely to undermine existing agreements and arrangements—in particular the Bridlington agreement on disputes, principles and procedures
	<span class='label label-info column'>552</span>
which the TUC issued. The Government, as I said, deny that.

It is worth drawing the Committee's attention to developments which are pertinent to that point. The Secretary of State this week wrote to the TUC on the subject of picketing and asked it to reissue—or re-emphasise—the guidance which it had previously put out. The General Secretary of the TUC, Len Murray, made it clear in his response that he had no intention of doing that because, as he saw it, the legislation before us was clearly in conflict with the TUC's views and policy and was undermining these very disputes procedures which we have been discussing. That is clear first-hand evidence that the case that we have been arguing throughout our debates on the clause is substantial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is happening on so many fronts is that the Government are trying to get other people to do their dirty work. In this instance they are saying "We shall hold a pistol to the heads of trade unionists and working people, and halfway through the shoot-up we shall hand the pistol over to the TUC and tell it to take over and sort it out for us."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They are doing it elsewhere. I shall not stray from order, Mr. Leadbitter, except to mention that in the Health Service and in local government precisely the same thing is happening. They are seeking other people to do their dirty work—people who resent the policies that the Government are imposing on them, large sections of the community, as well as those who are required to carry out these policies, are resentful. The Government are inducing bloody-mindedness in society at all levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be said that the TUC's attitude on this could be described as bloody minded. It is not really. In the end, industrial relations are human relations. The one thing that the Government have signally failed to get right throughout their period of office is human relations. That is nowhere more evident that in this Bill and our discussions on the clause have served only to underline it. Unless the hon. and learned Gentleman makes a substantial U-turn on the clause—and there is no indication that he is likely to do so—I and my right hon. and hon. Friends shall oppose it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>553</span>
This has been an interesting and wide-ranging debate. No one can say that it has not ranged over topical matters as well as over matters of principle. It has been of value because it has demonstrated that the arguments that can be adduced against the clause can be adduced only by those who object to its fundamental principle—that there shall not only be a right not to be unreasonably expelled or excluded from a trade union in a closed shop industry but that there shall be an enforceable remedy if that right is infringed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened with care to the arguments on the various amendments and, almost without exception—the exceptions have been on technical amendments—those who have argued against the clause and in support of the amendments have done so because they do not believe that there should be an enforceable remedy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the opening remarks of the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) when he sought to set out the common ground. I always think that that is a valuable exercise in any debate. I agree with him that it is common ground that voluntary procedures are best in industrial relations and that law ought only to be a backstop; that we all seek industrial peace, though we differ as to the best road by which it can be achieved—and I am particularly grateful for that recognition—and that the rights of individuals are of the greatest importance. He went on to say that unfair discrimination ought to lead to redress. With all of that, I agree, and I am grateful that that was set out as being common ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the hon. Gentleman said that the rights of individuals could be in conflict with other principles, and the burden of the remainder of his speech and of other hon. and right hon. Gentlemen was that the clause, if enacted, would undermine the voluntary procedures. The voluntary procedures, it is said, are working well, and to undermine them is without cause because the Government cannot show that all is not well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This really is the root, and I will answer that point in this way. Certainly it is right, as I have reiterated in the past, that the voluntary procedures of trade unions themselves should be given
	<span class='label label-info column'>554</span>
an opportunity to work, and, if they can deliver the goods, that is fine. The independent review committee has done valuable work so far as it has been able to go. But neither the internal procedures nor the IRC have been able to provide an enforceable remedy. That is the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I am asked for illustrations of real life cases where the end result has fallen short of what is necessary, I think I am entitled to refer to a review in the 	<i>Industrial Relations Review and Report</i> of the success of voluntarism. The independent review committee was the subject of the article in September 1979, and that respected publication reviewed at considerable length the various categories of cases that the IRC had considered. I think it is worth wearying the Committee with its conclusion, although I am not sure that the Committee will be wearied, having been inured to extensive citations from a report of the CBI conference. So I think I am entitled to read the concluding paragraph. It refers to its findings and says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We must conclude that the IRC has been only partially successful in providing effective remedies for complainants. It has been extremely successful in getting complainants admitted or re-admitted into union membership where it has recommended such a step."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher) says, "Hear, hear." But it goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On the other hand it has been singularly ineffective in securing re-engagement or alternative employment for complainants, although it admits this is often an individual's main concern."</p></blockquote>
This goes to the root of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric G. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been following what the Under-Secretary has been saying about voluntarism, and I must say that he is using a rather selective quotation because the article certainly comes down very much in favour of persevering with the independent review committee and the success of voluntarism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does he say, for example, to the case of a constituent of mine who worked for T. I. Chesterfield? It is referred to on the second page of the article to which the Under-Secretary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0800">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>555</span>
referred. Readmittance was agreed to the General Municipal Workers' Union and the union agreed to help the complainant to be re-engaged. But, although he was readmitted, the employer refused to accept the man back into employment. How would the provisions in the clause assist in such cases as that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This again goes to the root of the point that we want a speedy resolution of these matters. If an employer has had to find a successor for someone who has been deprived of his union card in a closed shop firm or industry, of course he has to get rid of him. If the voluntary procedures have taken so long that months have gone by—and sometimes even longer—that he has had to find a successor, of course he will be reluctant to reinstate. That is exactly the point I sought to make at our last sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With a firm like Tube Investments, employing thousands of people in my constituency, it is really stretching it a great deal to suggest that over a period of time, although readmittance had taken place, that man could not be found employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not presume to comment on the individual case, of which I know less than the right hon. Gentleman does, because it was his constituent. I deplore, however, any unfairness, whether it comes from the employers' side or from the trade union side. I am seeking to say, in response to the right hon. Gentleman's point, that the longer the voluntary procedures take, the greater the necessity for an employer—in many cases that one can readily visualise of someone who is a key worker—to take on someone else. The original complainant finds that he wins. The IRC cannot get hold of the case until the internal procedures have been exhausted, and at the end of the day says that the employer ought to take this chap back, and he is taken back. What is the employer to do then? Must he sack the replacement? If he does so, he is done for unfair dismissal, subject to the lapse of enough time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It really has been a part of the hon. and learned Gentle-
	<span class='label label-info column'>556</span>
man's argument and that of his hon. Friends that this procedure is necessary because the trade unions behave in an unreasonable and unsympathetic way towards the individuals who might be the subject of such applications as are provided for by the clause. I see, however, that in page 5 of the same article to which the hon. and learned Gentleman was referring, reference is made to the case of a Mr. Mayhew-Smith who was kept in employment at the request of the union pending the outcome of the IRC hearing. That does not suggest that unions regard such applicants with a lack of sympathy, and it goes a long way from supporting the case of the hon. and learned Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful if I were able to complete one stage of my argument before the right hon. Gentleman who began today's proceedings with a speech, interrupted it. I am anxious to help the Committee as best I can, but I will do it better if I am able to complete one stage at a time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am relying not on something I take out of the air but upon the conclusions of an extensive and respectable survey of the operations of the IRC by a respected publication in this field. It concludes that, whereas the IRC has been effective in getting reinstatement into unions, it has been "singularly ineffective" in securing re-engagement or alternative employment for complainants, although it admits that this is often an individual's main concern. Of course, it is often an individual's main concern, because his union card is the passport to a job. This is where the clause becomes relevant. It really does not advantage anyone very much if he is working in a closed shop industry to be given back his union card if he cannot get a job and cannot have compensation. Under the existing arrangements, voluntary and therefore desirable though they are, there is no enforceable remedy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon and learned Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I will. I had the pleasure of listening to the hon. Gentleman for about 25 minutes. Now I am seeking to answer one of the many points that he made. That is why it is necessary, if one is to match words with deeds, to take the precept of the hon. Member
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0801">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>557</span>
for Bethnal Green and Bow, that the rights of an individual are of the greatest importance and that unfair discrimination ought to lead to redress. If we are to match our deeds to those words, we have to provide a system whereby, if the card is restored but a job is not, the resulting loss of earnings may be compensated in cash.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I have been able to give the hon. and learned Gentleman a little pleasure this morning and that he has learned something from my brief intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman has made, with his Department, a great study of the issues involved in clause 3. It would be of enormous benefit to this side of the Committee if he told us how many individuals in the last two or three years would have been covered by clause 3 and would have benefited from it. I am sure that the Department of Employment, under the hon. and learned Gentleman's direction, has carried out a widespread survey to prove the great injustices which arise. Can he tell us now how many cases have been discovered which would be covered by clause 3?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To begin with, all the cases would be covered in respect of which—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am asking the hon. and learned Gentleman how many.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that I had the hon. Gentleman's energy, let alone his determination. All those cases would be covered in respect of which this review reports that the IRC has been singularly ineffective in securing re-engagement or alternative employment. In every case in which the IRC has found that exclusion or expulsion from a union has been unjustifiable and there has been no reinstatement or re-engagement in a job, there would, under the clause, had it been on the statute book, have been the right to claim compensation for the loss of future earnings. I should have thought that that was self-evident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the hon. Gentleman to the cases which are set out at great length in the review, but I do not propose to read them out 	<i>seriatim</i> or in any other way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can understand the hon. and learned Gentleman's embarrassment on the question of how many, I
	<span class='label label-info column'>558</span>
believe that two days ago his prompt gave him a figure of four in the whole of recorded human history. If I am wrong, I shall be corrected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purport of our amendment was that the trade unionist should go through the union procedure first and probably resolve the matter without this tedious, vexatious and expensive business of taking up the time of the tribunal. But if, at the end of the day, there were any future cases, applicants would still have the option of going to the tribunal. That would remain open. Moreover, as the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) pointed out, if the procedure was lengthy, the unions would have to pay more in damages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what the purport of the proposition is that in the whole of recorded human history there has been only a smallish number of these cases. If one goes back to the feudal system, it is not so suprising that there have not been many recorded cases during that period of our rough island story in which an unreasonable exclusion from the serfs' society did not lead to compensation. I have already told the Committee how many cases were brought during the 18 months in which the 1974 Act was on the statute book and how they broke down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, to come to the germane point of the hon. Gentleman's intervention, I have indicated already that the Government will consider amendment No. 36, the purpose of which was to give at any rate a reasonable period in which the voluntary procedures might work before a claim was made under clause 3 to the tribunal, for reasons which I completely understand. It is important not to undermine the voluntary procedures—I am not conceding that clause 3 undermines them—but I have undertaken to consider that on behalf of the Government, and I hope that that will be seen as an earnest of the Government's good faith.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to note the hon. and learned Gentleman's concern about injustice. There have been only four cases of injustice in the recorded history of mankind brought about by the trade union movement. Those were four cases too many.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0802">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>559</span>
For the sake of equity—the hon. and learned Gentleman has a proud record in this respect—will he at a later stage accept a new clause from the Opposition to put right the injustice on countless occasions to men and women who have lost their employment and have been blacked from further employment because of their trade union activities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am prepared, if necessary, to weary the Committee on a future occasion with hundreds of such cases. I should be grateful if the hon. and learned Gentleman would now indicate that he would be prepared to accept a new clause which would cover that unfortunate situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It would no doubt, be fascinating on a future occasion to hear all the cases, provided that we do not go back to Neanderthal man, but we must be careful of the extent to which we go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon, Gentleman would need to construct his clause carefully. That is the difficulty and, no doubt, the reason why the TUC has, to my knowledge, never pressed for such legislation and why the Government—of which both right hon. Gentlemen were such distinguished members between 1974 and 1979—have never brought forward a measure to deal with blacklisting. Such a measure, in equity, needs to cover discrimination on grounds of union membership and of non-membership—something like section 5 of the 1971 Act which the Labour Party and the TUC strongly opposed. That is the difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see the attraction in principle of such a provision, but the experience of the 1971 Act showed that it has not proved to be practicable in the past and there is no reason to suppose that it would be more practicable now. But the constraint of practicability does not apply to clause 3. The terms of reference of the TUC's own independent review committee give it authority to hear cases of refusal to admit, and it has done so. I suspect that that is why the Labour Government never sought to introduce a measure of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must not be lured into these interesting but perhaps rather remotely connected paths. I understand what has been said by, among others, the hon. Member for Darlington, who expressed the fear that
	<span class='label label-info column'>560</span>
this would be a maverick's charter. I return to the concept of what is reasonable. The tribunal would have to consider whether it was reasonable or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there are cases of sea lawyers, of mavericks, the tribunals will know how to deal with them just as they know how to deal with them in cases of unfair dismissal and in half a dozen other jurisdictions that the tribunals have to exercise. They will be able to deal with them all the more effectively if they have a wider ability to award costs where they consider that to bring the claim or complaint was unreasonable in the first instance than they have at the moment. I hope that the hon. Gentleman, with his right hon. Friends and hon. Friends, will support the Government when they introduce the necessary secondary legislation to enable tribunals to widen the basis upon which costs may be given against an unsuccessful complainant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow said, we have to deal with people as they are. I acknowledge that there will be some sea lawyers. But how can we immunise ourselves against sea lawyers with complete assurance if we remove from the law any reinforcement of such rights as we want to give? The hon. Gentleman says that we must see to it that the rights of individuals are sustained and that unfair discrimination ought to lead to redress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's case is that redress cannot be given for this right of an individual not to be unreasonably expelled from his union unless it is reinforced with an enforceable remedy, the right to get damages. If there are some sea lawyers who will take tiresome points, that is a price to pay if the result is that there is some enforceability given to the remedy which the hon. Gentleman and, I think, all his hon. Friends believe to be necessary in justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) shakes his head. I am sorry that the only lawyer on the Opposition side of the Committee—a distinguished one and a leading member of the Bar—should apparently be saying that there ought not to be an enforceable remedy for injustice. This is what it comes to. We believe that those who work in a closed shop industry suffer injustice if they lose their union card unreasonably and cannot get compensation for the consequential loss they will suffer. If the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0803">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>561</span>
hon. and learned Gentleman disagrees with that, I shall be glad to hear how he puts it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot think why the hon. and learned Gentleman, who has been so kind to me throughout the Committee, should suddenly turn on me in that way. I am afraid that I did not hear what he was saying, and I certainly was not nodding my head at it. I was nodding in agreement with my hon. Friend's remark about sea lawyers. I did not understand what a sea lawyer was, and I was about to ask the hon. and learned Gentleman, who is very knowledgeable in these matters, exactly what a sea lawyer was. I was not agreeing or disagreeing with his proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great mistake, when I make a speech, to interpret those who nod off as nodding in agreement. I acknowledge that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I have woken the hon. Gentleman up. There are great advantages in leaving the hon. Gentleman to nod off, but I do not seem to have secured that yet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. and learned Gentleman that there is not much chance of my falling asleep, especially when he is on his feet. He has drawn a parallel between the tribunal as proposed under clause 3 and other tribunals, and he has referred to sea lawyers and frivolous cases. Will he agree that the one major difference between this tribunal and other tribunals is that, if a maverick or frivolous case comes before one of the other tribunals, in almost every case the individual maverick is acting on his own, whereas what we shall be faced with here is a maverick well represented by a Tory union-bashing lawyer who will be seeking to gain not only compensation from the union but also a vast amount of publicity?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is that not the major difference between this proposed tribunal and all the other semi-legal or quasi-legal bodies which have been established over the past few years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think so at all. We have already heard from the hon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>562</span>
Gentleman the great advantages of joining a trade union, and I entirely agree with him. One of the most eloquent of his points was the tremendous legal back-up that the trade union movement gives to its members, and it is not to be supposed that that legal backup will not be available to a trade union in its own cause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is a unique feature in the clause in regard to industrial tribunals, and this is a direct answer to the hon. Gentleman's point. If, by some mischance, an industrial tribunal wrongly decides in favour of a maverick complaining that he has been unreasonably excluded, in this jurisdiction under clause 3, alone among all the industrial tribunal jurisdictions, there will be the ability for the trade union to appeal on an issue of fact as well as law to the employment appeal tribunal. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman makes a most provocative comment when he talks about the trade union having the right under clause 3 to appeal to the employment tribunal on a matter of fact. The nature of the appeals that are almost certain to arise is obvious. But I shall defer the point, Mr. Leadbitter. I shall return to it later when we come to clause 4 if I may, when I shall hope to argue the differences in the nature of the appeals that will lie under clauses 3 and 4. I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will regard that as being on notice now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the first time I have heard any hon. Member rise to say that he will defer a point that he wishes to make. However, the right hon. Gentleman is very versatile and he enlarges our experience of parliamentary procedures every day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wanted to end on a serious note, because I do not want it to be supposed in any way that I treat the views that have been expressed by several hon. Gentlemen, notably by the hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans), other than seriously. The hon. Gentleman said that it was important to remember the deep feelings in the trade union movement and among industrial working-class people in support of solidarity and against those who, as it is said, scab, and this being a matter of tremendous emotional and historical signi-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0804">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>563</span>
ficance to people on whose behalf hon. Members are speaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that line of argument, and I ask the hon. Gentleman to accept that I understand the feelings which he describes. He says that that alone is sufficient reason for opposing a Bill which will prevent a union from excluding its members if, for example, they have contravened one or other clause of its disciplinary procedures. I think that he has left out an important factor, and that factor is the organisation of a closed shop industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, when one keeps in mind the historical development of the trade union movement, those sentiments, emotions and reactions will be strongly present, and I understand that, but they cannot be decisive where the trade union movement itself has secured, with the agreement of employers, a closed shop industry whereby the only person who may work and follow his trade or calling is somebody who becomes and remains a member of a union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there is, and should be in a civilised society, a liberty to work, and if trade union solidarity is to be carried to the extent that a person may be unreasonably expelled from his union and in consequence lose his liberty to follow the only trade that he knows, there should be a forum, a tribunal or a court in which that person's case can be heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the case is upheld, not on some arcane, unrealistic or fanciful set of principles but upon the basis of what is reasonable having regard to equity and to the substantial merits of the case as determined by an experienced tribunal—experienced in the realities of industrial life—I believe that the overwhelming demand of justice is that there should be an enforceable remedy, if, as the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow says, our deeds are to match our words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, after a full debate which has widely rehearsed the principles and the details that arise from this clause, I believe that the case is very strongly made for it to stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to make a second speech, but the hon. and learned Gentleman has goaded me and, I am sure, my hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Speak up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friends and to the Committee. Perhaps we ought not to be compelled to sit in this huge barn, Mr. Leadbitter. If we had a more sensible Committee room in which to meet, one might not have to raise one's voice in this manner, which inevitably tends to raise the temperature of the whole debate. That, of course, is something that we ought to try to avoid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman a straightforward question? In seeking to twit my right hon. Friend and myself about compensation, he referred to possible hypothetical support for secondary legislation to determine the amounts of compensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, costs in the event of an unsuccessful application.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. and learned Gentleman wants to answer that point straightaway, will he tell me to which secondary legislation he refers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In their working papers published in September 1979, the Government indicated that they wished to widen the basis on which industrial tribunals could, in unfair dismissal cases, award costs in the event of unsuccessful claims. At the moment, as the Committee knows, that is limited to cases in which the tribunal finds that it was frivolous or vexatious to bring the claim. Many recognise that that imposes great hardship on employers who have to spend a day, or two or three days, at a tribunal defending a claim with perhaps three or four witnesses who carry on key functions in their jobs when, at the end of it, they may not even get costs. Costs are awarded in only 2 to 3 per cent, of unfair dismissal cases.

I was indicating that exactly the same reasons for that proposal would apply under clause 3. I was venturing the hope that the Opposition might welcome a wider ability on the part of tribunals to award costs against a maverick complainant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We have worked on the assumption that the industrial tribunals would continue under the same regime as has applied until now. For us to be told, after we have discussed the clause, that the rules will be changed is a bit much. The hon. and learned Gentleman owed it to the Committee to tell us in advance. We shall want to reflect on what he has said and perhaps ask for a fuller statement in the light of the powers given to the tribunals in the next clause.

After my challenge to the hon. and learned Gentleman about the appeal powers in subsection (8), and his response to goad me on that, I have reflected further, and I think that you may rule me out of order, Mr. Leadbitter, if I seek to raise on clause 4 a matter which stems from our recent exchange on clause 3.

The hon. and learned Gentleman will recall that we debated an amendment to exclude from the scope of the employment appeal tribunal consideration of questions of fact.

learned Gentleman—that we are discussing questions of interpretation of trade union rules. We are discussing essentially trade union matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, to revert to the question of the appeal, the Committee should note that appeals that will arise under clause 3 will almost certainly be appeals by a trade union against a decision of the tribunal. In those circumstances, the tribunal is able to take into account these much wider considerations of the law and the facts. But in clause 4, under which the appeals claim will almost certainly be appeals against trade unions, there is no reference to facts. That is a deliberate inequity built in against trade unions. There is a wider scope of appeal in the one case than in the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One point that we omitted to emphasise when debating our amendment was that we are seeking to put in some balance here, but the imbalance is preserved. In the light of the hon. and learned Gentleman's remarks and of what we have just learnt about the proposed changes in the industrial tribunal's rules, we shall want to think again about the arguments that we have deployed on clause 3.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not dream of disagreeing with your grouping of the amendments, Mr. Leadbitter, or with Mr. Goodhew's advice. I merely make the point that they deal essentially with the same issue except for amendment No. 55. In its proposal to leave out subsection (8), it goes rather wider than the purpose of the group as a whole. I hope to make that clear as I go along.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first purpose of the amendments is to fillet out from the determination of compensation the role proposed for the employment appeal tribunal. It seems inexplicable that there should be dual jurisdiction, two judicial bodies dealing with the essentially same matter, although a division is written in between them. We are entitled to have it explained why there should be this dual jurisdiction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, and no less important, the employment appeal tribunal—which is what it was constituted as and intended to be, an appellate body—seems to be given a primary jurisdiction that has nothing to do with appeals. That may well have far-reaching consequences for the employment appeal tribunal and is certainly in defiance of and possibly to the frustration of the intention of the establishment of such a body. I should be grateful to hear the hon. and learned Gentleman on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that amendment No. 55, to delete the whole of subsection (8), went wider, and I do not know whether it might be wise to defer my arguments on that until we come to a later batch of amendments, starting with amendment No. 65. Clearly, in addition to the role that is being given to the employment appeal tribunal under the clause and its particular role in subsection (8), we would want also to discuss the extraordinarily large carrots that the subsection dangles before anyone who may be able to cock up some grievance against his union. But this is a matter to which may return when my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column'>568</span>
Mikardo) moves amendment No. 65. For the moment, in anticipation of the hon. and learned Gentleman's response to my brief points, I shall rest my argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman asks what is the role for the employment appeal tribunal here and why it has been singled out for what is, to some extent, a primary jurisdiction. May I remind the Committee of the structure for which clauses 3 and 4 provide. On a complaint being made for unreasonable exclusion, the complaint is made in the first instance to the industrial tribunal, and if it succeeds, a declaration is made. After the statutory pause of not less than four weeks, the complainant may, if he has not been admitted to the union or readmitted to the union, then make an application to the employment appeal tribunal reciting the facts and saying that in the circumstances he has suffered loss and is entitled to compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would have been possible to have kept this jurisdiction to the industrial tribunals and to have kept the jurisdiction of the employment appeal tribunal as an exclusively appellate jurisdiction. We thought quite seriously, as might be expected, about that. But we recognised that the realities were that this would form a difficult, delicate and sensitive jurisdiction. Therefore, in view of the fact that there were not likely to be very numerous cases falling within the clauses, we felt it was right to make use at this stage of the abilities, the experience, the standing and the seniority of those members who make up the panels of the employment appeal tribunal. The numbers are not likely to be so great as to make that impracticable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The standing of the employment appeal tribunal, to which tribute has been paid on both sides of the Committee—and I am grateful for it—would serve as reassurance to all concerned about the care, impartiality and common sense with which this jurisdiction would be exercised by it. We felt that, all in all, it was desirable for those and other reasons that the jurisdiction should go to the employment appeal tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In so doing, we are not altogether breaking with precedent. There are precedents for the EAT making awards of compensation. Under schedule 11 (21) of the 1978 Act, the EAT, in disposing of an appeal, may exercise any powers of the body or officer from whom the appeal was brought
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0807">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>569</span>
or may remit the case to that body or officer. In practice, when hearing appeals—for example, in cases of unfair dismissal—the EAT will not itself normally award compensation, but it has occasionally done so in cases where all the necessary facts were immediately available to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In so acting, it really takes the place of the Court of Appeal in civil jurisdiction. The Court of Appeal on occasions, acts as a primary court and makes awards of its own. There is, therefore, no departure from past practice. It is something that, albeit not very often, the employment appeal tribunal is capable of doing, and does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EAT is a body which, while not part of the High Court, has the status of the High Court. That deals with the point the right hon. Gentleman made at the outset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of this group of amendments is to remove the EAT lock, stock and barrel from the jurisdiction of these two coupled clauses 3 and 4, save in its appellate jurisdiction. We do not think that is right, for the reasons I have given. I appreciate the reasons why the right hon. Gentleman has made a short speech at the outset. I will make an equally short speech in answering his points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I propose the Question, the hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) raised the question of the grouping. I have been looking at it with some care, and for his consideration of the proceedings as we go on, I suggest that the groupings will have to stand, as they specifically deal with the appeals tribunals in the point he had in mind, the calculation of the compensation, I draw his attention to the third grouping—that is, amendments Nos. 65, 66, 47, 48 and 67—which deals specifically with the calculation of compensation. Certainly amendment No. 48 deals with subsection (8) in that it seeks to introduce a new paragraph (	<i>c</i>). At the first opportunity, he ought therefore to debate amendment No. 65, now in this grouping. Although a Division on it would not be possible in this grouping, he will achieve the same objective in the third grouping of the selected amendments. If he follows what I have said, he could take the opportunity of commenting now whether he is in agreement with what I have suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not
	<span class='label label-info column'>570</span>
dream of challenging anything that you put to the Committee, Mr. Leadbitter. I am fully prepared to accept your explanation of the grouping and the way in which we should proceed. Obviously I would have been a little happier if we could have had a Division on amendment No. 55, but I would not dream of trying to press you and the Committee on that. My hon. Friends will be quite happy to accept your ruling on this matter. As you rightly say, we shall have an opportunity to debate the whole issue and press it to a Division in the Committee when we discuss that third group of amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to detain the Committee any longer on the amendment under discussion, except to say to the hon. and learned Gentleman that he has said that he does not think the industrial tribunals are up to dealing with certain parts of the Government's proposals. I am not going to press the matter, although I am not sure that we are at all happy with the hon. and learned Gentleman's argument. If none of my hon. Friends wishes to speak on the matter, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad the Committee is satisfied. It is the proper way to proceed, and I hope that my assistance to the Committee has helped to take us on to the next debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 56, in page 5, line 44, leave out "twelve" and insert "three".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall do so very briefly, as it is a probing amendment to discover from the hon. and learned Gentleman why the Government have seized on the figure of 12. Unfair dismissal claims have to be lodged within three months of the dismissal date, and we find it difficult to see any reason why compensation claims against trade unions should be allowed 12 months after the date of the industrial tribunal declaration as set out in the earlier clause. It seems logical to us that in this situation the same three-month limit should apply, but perhaps the hon. and learned Gentleman can give us an explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the way in which the hon. Gentleman has moved his amendment. I should like to indicate very briefly the considerations that lay
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0808">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>571</span>
behind the 12-month stipulation in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that we are talking of the period within which an application to the employment appeal tribunal must be brought once a declaration of unreasonable expulsion has been secured from the industrial tribunal, and if after four weeks the union concerned has not implemented the declaration by saying to the person concerned " Very well, we will readmit you".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why we thought it right to include 12 months in the clause was that we felt that adequate time should be allowed to elapse for voluntary procedures, or possibly conciliation, to take place. Supposing we were to stipulate a very much shorter period. We would be up against a point we have already discussed with a measure of agreement today that we are not really allowing the parties to get together and come to an agreed or conciliated solution. We all agree that wherever that is possible, it is desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that probably 12 months is a good deal too long, quite honestly, and we are open to reconsidering this. On the one hand, we do not want to rush the matter, for the reasons that I have given. On the other hand, there must be a reasonable backstop, otherwise we may perpetuate a source of grievance and of disagreement, as well as having the matter ultimately considered when it has gone stale. So where we draw the line is a matter of judgment. But the deliberately long period is designed to encourage individuals not to make early application to the EAT, claiming that readmission has not been granted, when voluntary progress might be made on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I. am not, however, saying that three months is necessarily very much better. A three-month period, when one knocks off the four weeks that have to elapse to allow the union to make up its mind, leaves only about eight to nine weeks for the application to be made. I think that it is to the advantage of all parties that there should be no unnecessary pressure to settle matters by litigation when there is any reasonable prospect of its being settled through the available voluntary procedures. I think that it is to the advantage of trade unions as well as individuals that an individual should not be made anxious about ramming in a claim in case he finds that he is out of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>572</span>
The hon. Gentleman is right when he says that there is less reason for an extended period for application to an industrial tribunal in a case where the applicant has been readmitted to a union. But even in these cases there seems to be every reason for giving both parties the maximum opportunity to settle any differences over the amount of compensation without recourse to a tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are sympathetic to the spirit behind the amendment. We are by no means saying that three is much better than 12, but we are open to be persuaded that 12 is too long. I have tried to indicate the opposing considerations that have to be balanced. We should like to think again about this and, if that is satisfactory to the hon. Member for Islington Central (Mr. Grant), perhaps we may proceed on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend comes in further, I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman, as I am sure my right hon. and hon. Friends are, for the co-operative way in which he has dealt with this. Since we are dealing with an amendment which covers appeals to the EAT, there is one point which is slightly outside the scope of what he has said, but I have looked through the whole of the remaining amendments on the clause which are to be called and I cannot see anywhere else that it could arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, may I put this question to the hon. and learned Gentleman. When he replied to an earlier debate on an amendment which has been withdrawn, he dealt with all the points raised by my right hon. Friend except one. That was the question of why there is a difference between the provision in clause 3 and the provision in clause 4 in that, under the former, one can appeal on a point of fact and, under the latter, one cannot. Would the hon. and learned Gentleman be kind enough to find some suitable opportunity of answering that question so that we may be clear about it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will gladly do it now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. and learned Gentleman does so, may I raise another point, to save him time later? If the hon. and learned Gentleman wants me to raise it later on clause stand part, I shall be happy to do so. However, seeing that my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0809">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>573</span>
Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) has raised a matter which touches very near the further point that I intend to raise, perhaps the hon. and learned Gentleman might have notice of it now, either to reply now or to reply later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have referred already to the fact that the employment appeal tribunal is being given a primary jurisdiction. The clause provides that there shall be an appeal against the decision of the industrial tribunal to the employment appeal tribunal. It is a bit odd, anyhow, that a body which already has some primary jurisdiction in a specific area should also be hearing appeals which lie in the same area. Putting that aside for a second, there is no provision, so far as I can see, for an appeal against a decision of the employment appeal tribunal when it is exercising its primary jurisdiction. Where will an appeal lie, if an appeal lies at all, against a decision of the EAT that arises under clause 4?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that the appeal will lie to the Court of Appeal, on the usual basis of appeals from tribunals. That is to say, there will not be an appeal to the Court of Appeal on matters of fact; there will be an appeal to the Court of Appeal on matters of law. That applies right across the whole spectrum of tribunals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will deal now with the point made by the right hon. Gentleman, and I am sorry that I did not deal with it at the time. The right hon. Gentleman founded his complaint upon the contrast between the appeal procedure laid down in clause 3 and the appeal procedure laid down in clause 4. I think he is saying that under clause 3 it is the complainant who will be complaining against the interests of trade unions to the employment appeal tribunal on matters of fact, whereas it will be the other way round under clause 4: it will be the trade union wishing to appeal there on matters of fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I simply do not understand why he should say that. Under clause 3, the right of appeal will be limited to whether or not the tribunal ought to have decided that the expulsion or exclusion was unreasonable, and, accordingly, whether it should have granted a declaration or not. Why the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) should say that the great majority of cases will be complaints by individual complainants rather than
	<span class='label label-info column'>574</span>
by trade unions, I do not know. On the one hand, a tribunal may decide that a man has been unreasonably expelled. Why should a union not wish to complain to the employment appeal tribunal under those circumstances? If the right hon. Gentleman is really saying that the trade unions will be generally content, what on earth is all the objection to in this jurisdiction in the first instance? I do not understand why he should say that it will be individuals who will have the majority of appeals and will wish to bring the majority of appeals and will wish to bring the majority of appeals under clause 3, and the other way round under clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I explain why under clause 4, which relates to the calculation of compensation alone, an appeal by way of fact is not provided as well as by way of law. Disputed issues of fact are much more likely to arise in the jurisdiction as to whether or not the expulsion has been unreasonable. The whole question of the background of the disciplinary proceedings, for example, will have to be gone into and issues of fact can be expected to be much more hotly contested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why we thought it right to reflect the ability to appeal on issues of fact as well as of law which we have always had in the magistrates' courts and which, in the limited instances which I was able to give the Committee when we last sat, the employment appeal tribunal has already. That is why we thought it right to give that jurisdiction under clause 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When it comes to calculating damage under clause 4, the only sort of damage which the industrial tribunal will be able to award is very slight. I am speaking from memory without looking at the clause, but I think I have it right. First, the industrial tribunal decides whether to grant a declaration. If it refuses a declaration, no question of compensation being paid arises. If it grants a declaration, only if the union decides to admit the individual does the question of compensation being awarded by the tribunal arise. Then it will only be for out-of-pocket expenses or loss of earnings during the interregnum, the interval between expulsion and re-admission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only in that limited field will any question of an award of compensation by the industrial tribunal arise. Therefore, it seemed to us that it is hardly to be supposed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0810">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>575</span>
that any disputed issues of fact are likely to arise, and certainly none that would warrant a right of appeal on fact to the employment appeal tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have shown that there is nothing sinister here. The circumstances in which anybody may wish to appeal on issues of fact from an award of compensation by the industrial tribunals are likely to be very few and of trivial significance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To ordinary chaps if one takes subsection (2), (7) and (8) together, it may look as though what the Government have in mind in giving the employment appeal tribunal primary jurisdiction powers side by side with those which the industrial tribunal has is that it has given the employment appeal tribunal power to determine a figure of compensation substantially higher than the industrial tribunal. Is that the real reason behind this duplication of primary jurisdiction powers? If so, is it not a pretty poor reason?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is partly but not wholly right. I have explained the extent to which under clause 4 the industrial tribunal has any power to make an award of compensation. I shall not repeat that because I know that the hon. Gentleman understands it. But it produces a very limited amount likely to be awarded—the amount that a person actually lost by being unable to work and his out-of-pocket expenses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The employment appeal tribunal's jurisdiction comes into play only when a declaration has not been implemented, a man has not been taken back into the union, and he is then able to say "The consequence of this is not only that I have lost money in the last few months but I shall go on losing it because I am out of a job and I cannot see when I shall get another one" In those circumstances, the amount of compensation to which he will be entitled will be higher. That was one of the reasons why we felt it desirable that the experience and seniority of the EAT was preferable—not that that amounts to a vote of no confidence or anything like it in industrial tribunals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the reasons that I have previously advanced, we thought it sensible and in everybody's interest, not least that of the unions concerned, that the employment appeal tribunal should give its mind to this particular jurisdiction. That is the reason. There is nothing sinister behind it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>576</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. and learned Gentleman's argument that in the overwhelming number of cases the award of damages by the industrial tribunal, for the reason that he has given, will be small. But if for some reason it awarded damages out of all proportion to the loss suffered, what remedy would the complainant have? Would it not be better that he should be safeguarded by at least a right of appeal on fact to the employment appeal tribunal, even if it were seldom used?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for raising that point. If it awarded compensation that was plainly unsustainable on the basis of the facts that had been given, it would be wrong in law and the appeal would be heard by the EAT as an appeal in law. There is therefore no need for a special appeal on fact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was asking whether there would be a right of appeal if it was genuinely correct in law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press the hon. and learned Gentleman further on his reason for the period of 12 months? He will agree that clauses 3 and 4 hang closely together, and we have been discussing time limits. Previously, we moved amendments to provide that matters should be dealt with through the union procedures first. The hon. and learned Gentleman argued that that could take a long time. It was suggested that a time limit be allowed for trade union procedures. Trade unions would look at a case and it could then go to the independent review committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One hon. Member said that three months would be a reasonable time for the unions to go through their procedures. Another said that they should be allowed six months. The consensus on the Government Benches seemed to be that six months would be a reasonable period for the whole of the trade union procedure. Now we find the period of 12 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a trade union member feels a real sense of grievance, why does it take him 12 months to realise that he is aggrieved? It seems an enormous amount of time in which to come to the conclusion that one is aggrieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

a good deal of sympathy for the hon. Gentleman's argument, which has now been reiterated. I hope that he will not press me further lest he hardens me up in the opposite direction. I am just as sympathetic as I was, but I cannot give an undertaking to accept three months or, indeed, to depart from 12. But I should like to depart from 12 if, on advice, it seems the right thing to do. I sympathise with the argument. I think that on balance it is too long and I should like to shorten it. But there are countervailing considerations which have to be weighed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his helpful response. But we are talking about compensation and not about what might be called the original sin. There is a real difference between compensation and conciliation. Conciliation is not likely to be applicable in a compensation situation, though I do not say that it should be ruled out. But even when that is the case—for instance, when there has not been a readmission to the union, which is where the conciliation procedure might work—presumably there is nothing to prevent the conciliation function from continuing after the application has been made.

Although I understand the Minister's reluctance this morning to accept three months, I think that that is not an unreasonable period to settle on in this instance. In the light of the undertaking he has given to look at this again sympathetically with a view to reducing the period—and, I hope, appreciably—I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment and those grouped with it are quite frankly probing amendments, It is appropriate when one is moving a probing amendment that one's speech should be interrogatory and consist not of dogmatic assertions but of a search for the eternal verities. I have one or two questions for the hon. and learned Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is a question that I often tend to ask whenever I am dealing with any clause of any Bill in which a figure is inserted which seems to be arbitrary: where does this figure of 30 come from? What justifies the figure of 30 rather than 35, 25, 40, 20 or whatever? Have the Government got it right? Is it any more than "How long is a piece of string?". If the hon. and learned Gentleman retorts that if his clause is "How long is a piece of string", my amendment is "How long is two-thirds of a piece of string", my answer will be "Touché, but what about it?". It is the Government's business to draft the legislation and not mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the hon. and learned Gentleman where he gets his figures from and what in terms of £s and p. those figures mean both in relation to subsection (7) and subsection (8). Can he put a sterling figure on the result of the two calculations in each of the two subsections? If, as may be possible, that is a bit of an unfair question to ask him off the top of his head, it could well be that before long you will be dismissing us, Mr. Leadbitter, and the hon. and learned Gentleman will have some three hours to do a little research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only other point that I wish to make is to reiterate something that I said earlier. If the sterling figures the hon. and learned Gentleman produces are pretty substantial, this creates an incentive for what earlier I called the sea lawyer and my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) called the maverick. If anyone wants to know the difference, a sea lawyer is a maverick with a good memory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever one calls them, a lot of money is involved here, and I rather suspect that when the hon. and learned Gentleman comes to give us the figure, it will be a lot of money. It really does create an incentive for the awkward squad. Although earlier on the hon. and learned

	<span class='label label-info column'>579</span>
Gentleman said that if we hold dear, as he and I do, the right of the individual to protection against discrimination, we must pay the price of the maverick. I would like to remind him that in a place such as Longbridge the price of a maverick can be very high indeed and we ought not to give too much encouragement by holding

out incentives to them in very large amounts of money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
