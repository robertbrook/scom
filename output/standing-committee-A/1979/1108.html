	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>CLASSIFICATION OF COMPANIES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment No. 94 proposed</i>[	<i>6 November</i>] in page 1, line 20, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"'proprietary company ' means a company limited by shares in which each of the directors is a shareholder, each of the shareholders is a director; and none of the shareholders is a company which is not a proprietary company; and in which two of the following criteria are applicable:
	<ol>
	<li>the amount of its net assets, as shown in the latest balance sheet at the conclusion of the annual general meeting (taking account of any distribution to shareholders or employees approved by that annual general meeting) together with the net assets of any other proprietary company or companies of which any of its directors is a director, is not greater than £650,000;</li>
	<li>the number of its employees other than directors does not exceed 50;</li>
	<li>the annual turnover in any of the last three accounting reference periods of the company, did not exceed £1,300,000.".—[	<i>Sir B. Rhys Williams</i>]</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are considering at the same time new clause 8—	<i>Proprietary companies' audit.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was reminded by my hon. Friend the Minister of State just before we began that I concluded our Tuesday sitting on a note of regret. I do not want to darken the whole proceedings this morning by inducing a mood of too much gloom. On the contrary, my optimism returns in that I believe we can look forward to legislation of a specific and 'helpful kind to assist proprietary companies in the course of the present Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether that will come in the form of another Companies Bill, or whether during our present deliberations we can insert into the present Bill opportunities under which the Secretary of State might
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
by order introduce innovations which would alleviate some of the burdens on small business, we shall no doubt have to discuss. I personally should favour the latter course because I do not entirely share the confidence of my hon. Friends that we shall see another Companies Bill in 1980–81.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Trade (Mr. Cecil Parkinson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must remember to explain that to my friends in the Marines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we shall have an opportunity to discuss whether we can insert powers into the Bill whereby the Secretary of State can act between now and the introduction of the next Companies Bill. Therefore, would you be so kind, Sir Stephen, to indicate whether you will allow the Committee to address you on that subject on clause stand part? If you are so indulgent as to agree, I can immediately end my remarks on this issue. If, however, you feel that the Committee has already given enough time to the clause there are certain other aspects on which I should like to comment at this stage. I should like to have your ruling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The chance of a debate on clause stand part taking place depends on how long the hon. Gentleman goes on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin my remarks, Sir Stephen, by thanking you for your indulgence in allowing the Committee this opportunity to debate the clause. I was taken by surprise at the speed with which you conduct the business, although having served under your Chairmanship during many happy mornings I certainly ought not to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I make on this clause is that it appears, for the time being at any rate, that the Department is still content that there should just be two classes of company—public companies and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
private companies. Although Ministers have given sincere acknowledgment of the need to introduce a new category, namely, proprietary companies, is that quite sufficient? Are the definitions of a proprietary company which we have been given strictly in accordance with reality and the needs of the moment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A proprietary company is reasonably well described in amendment No. 94, which I have just withdrawn—in other words, a company where the supervisors are the managers and are also the work force. That is a very small undertaking. However, in the Government's Green Paper the bottom tier proposed is a much larger body and so different in character that it appears to be a different animal, namely, a company with an annual turnover of £1,300,000, an average number of 50 employees and a balance sheet total of £650,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said on Second Reading that that appears to be different from a proprietary company. We are, therefore, entitled to ask the Minister to enlighten us whether the legislation which is in preparation to assist proprietary companies is the same as that contemplated for this bottom tier, or whether another category of companies is envisaged for the next Companies Bill. I should like that, although I realise that it is a complicated matter to introduce too many classes of companies for tax purposes, audit purposes, registration, supervision and the rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the very small family business where, as I have said, the supervisors are the managers and also the work force, is different from even a private company with 20, 30 or 50 employees. In that regard, I hope that there may be opportunities later to propose a new departure in company law to make possible what it might be appropriate to call a corporate partnership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that when companies begin to develop and grow, to take on more staff and increase their assets and responsibilities, company law as it is now defines for them a single path from a one-man business to a small private company and, eventually, to a public company, quoted public company and the rest. That is the nineteenth-century idea of the structure appropriate for the creation of wealth in the private sector, but with inflation, modern social con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
ditions and the many changes that have taken place in attitudes to work and employment in the twentieth century, we have to think of other forms of cooperation for the creation of wealth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a pity that ideas of the partnership have more or less atrophied where they stood 80 or 100 years ago. Partnerships are still very small bodies, and if an entrepreneur wishes to expand his business it will not normally occur to him, or even be possible for him, to do it by way of making it a corporate partnership. But for a number of reasons we need to pave the way for a certain option to be opened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most distressing aspects of small businesses is their unwillingness to expand because the proprietors are in danger of losing control if they do expand. We all know, unfortunately, that most British businesses are working unprofitably, or at a loss if one takes inflation accounting into the picture. A business is therefore not able normally to generate from its own cash flow the funds on which significant expansion can be based. Therefore, the proprietor or entrepreneur is obliged to go, first, to the bank, and eventually to other sources of capital, in order to obtain the wherewithal for the business to grow. In so doing, he risks the loss of control of the organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we should help small businesses to find a way round that dilemma, which we shall not do if we simply stick to nineteenth-century forms as we do in the clause. We must consider new ways of working in which the proprietor can retain control. I envisage a kind of corporate partnership where there is no equity but possibly a reversion to the old idea of a debenture or preference share, dynamised to take account of inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One cannot expect sources of finance to invest in debentures where there is no system of indexation. But I think that the growing acknowledgment of the value added as one of the measures of the success of a business is something that we can build on. It would be worth permitting companies to experiment with a new form of organisation in which they have no equity and no dividend in the traditional sense but where the capital is remunerated by a fixed proportion of the value added, the remains
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
of the surplus from each year's trading remaining with the business or being taken out in the form of salaries and wages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is so important to encourage businesses to finance their own expansion that we ought to pamper them with privileges if they adopt that formula. We ought, for instance, to make them exempt from corporation tax. We ought to give them the same sort of benefit for funds which they set aside for particular purposes within the business, such as retraining and research, as we do for the provision of pensions. Over the past 50 years there has been a tremendous new source of saving developed as a result of the tax concessions given to companies to build up pension funds with useful exemptions from tax until such time as the moneys are disbursed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we should find every way we can of encouraging business to put money out of the current account into the capital account, particularly for retraining and the development of the sense of corporate activity within the business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that in limiting the distribution one should put companies in a position to make very large bonuses. Instead, one should encourage business to build up very large reserves which can be dedicated to the survival of the business and the interests of all concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These were the thoughts passing through my head as I considered whether we ought at once to move on from clause 1 on the classification of companies. It seems rather sad that we are preparing to pass into law something which the Government in their Green Paper have acknowledged to be out of date and upon which the Green Paper seems to give us inadequate leadership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the comment I make to my hon. Friend. If he is willing to give us some of his thoughts at this stage, the Committee will, I believe, be grateful. I certainly should.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start by assuring my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) that we intend to have a Companies Bill in 1980-81. We intend that the consultations on the Green Paper to which he referred should be full and that the re-
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
sults of those consultations will be reflected in the Bill we shall bring forward. If I can settle my hon. Friend's doubts about that, he may be a little less anxious about trying to insert into this Bill provisions which he will have plenty of opportunity of inserting into the next Bill, which will be in 1980–81.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now take up my hon. Friend's point about the consultative document and the proprietary company, comparing it with the smallest category of company suggested in the Green Paper. That is a document which has been put forward by the Government for discussion purposes. The Government are open to representations and will take all representations into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend may recall that when we were in opposition the present Secretary of State and I called a conference of a wide range of interests to discuss a consultative document that had been prepared by the Conservative small businesses bureau, which does such an excellent job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that document a range of possibilities were set out. It was quite interesting that those present—they were a considerable number, representing as wide a cross-section as we could find; over 60 organisations were represented—said that they did not wish to see company law cluttered with too many different categories of company. Most of them opted for the smaller classification as outlined in the fourth directive. I remind my hon. Friend that there is another school of thought. The strong view emerging from the soundings that we took in opposition was "Please do not have too many categories of company. It will confuse everyone."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned the corporate partnership. He may know that this is an idea which has been put up to the Department by, among others, the National Chamber of Trade. We are considering the idea. I recognise many of the problems that my hon. Friend talked about because I had them myself when I started a business with inadequate capital, wished to retain control of my company and had to use a variety of means of raising the money that I needed to be able to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a real problem, and once again my bon. Friend has identified it. We are looking at the solution that he sug-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0043">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
gested, but we must do so all the time within the framework that we must not clutter up our company law with too many different structures and possibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank my hon. Friend for the way that he introduced his amendments to the clause and for his remarks on stand part, and I give him my assurance that I look forward to having many debates with him in 1980–81 about topics clear to both our hearts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend. I had not appreciated that the concept of the corporate partnership had such august advocacy, which encourages me to believe that we should look into the matter much more deeply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully recognise that we must not make our company law too complex; if anything, it needs to be simplified. However, we should at the same time provide small businesses with a range of options. Simply to guide them along the nineteenth-century pattern, in which the shareholders gradually ranged themselves as a body separate from, and even opposed to, the work force, is most unfortunate and seriously counter-productive in all too many cases today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if we do not go into a proliferation of possibilities in company law, I hope that there will soon be an opportunity for developing the concept of a corporate partnership in which all concerned recognise that they are on the same side and have a stake in the business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The disastrous point for every company is the crossing over from a sense of being a united team to the time when shareholders' representatives on the board, or top management, feel themselves somehow to be in conflict with, or opposed to, the work force. If we could produce a type of company in which that development was not built into the ground rules, we should do a great deal of good for small and medium-size businesses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 115, in page 2, line 27, leave out from "or" to end of line 29.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

and insert "in Table B".</p>
	<p>No. 119, in Schedule I, page 67, leave out Part II.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to you, Sir Stephen, for saying that we may discuss with No. 115 the other four amendments mentioned in your provisional selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that the amendments will not enable us to hold a debate of such high intellectual calibre as we have just had. They do not come in that category at all. In fact, they are drafting amendments to a great extent, although I have probed to see why some of the lines that I have suggested should be left out are in the Bill at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the Committee to subsection (2) of clause 1:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On or after the appointed day, no company may be formed as, or become, a company limited by guarantee with a share capital."</p></blockquote>
It puzzles me, therefore, why we then have a form in part II of schedule 1 for
	<br><blockquote><p>"A Public Company Limited by Guarantee and having a Share Capital",</p></blockquote>
because we have already destroyed such companies in future by subsection (2) of clause 1. They cannot be formed in future; nor can any existing company become such a company. It might be construed from those words that if the company limited by guarantee with a share capital is a private company, it should not in future even become a public company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer now to the amendments, which would leave out some of the words in subsection (4) of clause 2 and leave out part II of schedule 1. Subsection (4) sets out the forms which must be used in the formation of companies, and says that part I of the schedule shall apply to a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0044">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
public company, and if that company
	<br><blockquote><p>"is a company limited by guarantee and having a share capital"</p></blockquote>
its memorandum must be in the form in part II, and other forms set out in tables B and D of the 1948 Act should be superseded by forms in the schedule to this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are not to encourage companies limited by guarantee in future—in short, to say that none shall be formed—why not leave the forms in the 1948 Act instead of cluttering the Bill with forms which will not be used in future?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I searched for a difference between the form in the 1948 Act for a company limited by guarantee with a share capital and the form set out in the present Bill. I do not know whether it is devolutionarily significant to discover that the form set out in the Bill applies to a company in Wales and the form set out in the 1948 Act applied to a company in Scotland. In the Bill the company's name listed in part II of schedule I is quite unpronounceable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not for a Welshman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Except by a Welshman, and I am not sure that we have here one who speaks that language. It looks to me like the sort of thing one sees in the television programme "The World About Us"—some strange insect—but I gather that the name has something to do with a hotel company. The form in the 1948 Act was for the Highland Hotel Company Limited; now, I gather from these strange Welsh words, it is to be a Welsh hotel. Is there any significance in this? It appears to me that the forms are the same except—I must mention this exception, of course—that in part II of schedule I to the Bill the form includes the phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The company is to be a public company."</p></blockquote>
Are we really to set out a couple of pages of print and a subsection to say that if an existing company limited by guarantee with a share capital wishes to become a public company it must follow the forms set out in the schedule, which differ from the 1948 Act by only one line of seven or eight words? It seems an unnecessary lot of printing and an unnecessary confusion for the person who will read the Bill should it become an Act. He is told in the first clause that no further companies
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
limited by guarantee with a share capital shall be formed, and in the next clause he is told that these are the forms to be used when they are formed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my amendments are not to be accepted and the Bill thus made much clearer, we shall have to have considerable thought about the word "become" in subsection (2) of clause I and whether it should be made perfectly clear that the forms now set out in the schedule apply only to the re-registration of an existing private company limited by guarantee with a share capital which wishes to become a public company. If they are in the Bill only for that small purpose, I am sure that it can be done in a much shorter way to become clearer to the person reading the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) has pointed out, the purpose of these amendments is to remove from the Bill all references to the constitution of public limited companies when those companies take the form of companies limited by guarantee but with a share capital. I hope that I shall be able to explain to hon. Members, and convince my right hon. Friend, that it is sensible to include these provisions in the Bill and not to remove them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am now advised that I should use a sentence that seems to me the height of optimism. I am to say that I apologise for the extent to which I have to go over material with which members of the Committee are already familiar. I myself certainly find this a most abstruse area of company law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three categories of limited company to be found under the Companies Acts. There are companies limited by shares; those are, of course, by far the most common. There are companies limited by guarantee without a share capital; there are not many of those, but there are still a considerable number. The final group, a hybrid, are companies limited by guarantee and having a share capital; these are quite rare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee will know, the Jenkins committee recommended in I962 that no new companies of that third type should be formed. A consultative and explanatory note on the EEC second directive, which was published by the Department of Trade in July 1977, asked people what they thought about that. It seems to have taken rather a long time—15
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0045">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
years after the Jenkins committee—to get round to asking the question. However, the question was finally asked. I am sure that the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) will recall it; it was one of the highlights of his term of office. In a written reply on 16 December of that year, he said there had been wide support for that recommendation of the Jenkins committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah yes, I remember it well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that it would all come back immediately to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We propose in the Bill to implement that recommendation, as did the previous Bill. I refer to clause 1 (2) and (3). The effect of those provisions is to prevent any new companies limited by guarantee but having a share capital from coming into existence. But they do not prejudice the position of existing companies of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the position of that category of company. There will be no new companies of this type, but there are existing ones, although they are relatively rare birds. Many of them undoubtedly are small concerns, or not of much commercial importance, which would not wish to be public limited companies, but there could be exceptions—companies with a share capital sufficient to justify public status under the new definition. I remind the Committee that these are companies with share capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is: should they be allowed to become public limited companies? The Bill as drafted would permit them to do so. The intention behind the amendments seems to be that they should not be allowed to do so, or perhaps that we should not allow that particular case to arise. I believe that my right hon. Friend said that he recognised the possibility of this need but that there might be a simpler way of dealing with it than the one we have proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my remarks have shown that although such occasions will be rare, perhaps very rare, some companies of this type might wish to become public. These would be existing companies, not newly formed ones. They may operate on quite an appreciable scale, with substantial numbers of employees, creditors and members who are quite content with the present
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
arrangements. Indeed, they may well fall within the present definition of public companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No machinery is provided in the Companies Acts for such companies to change their status to one or other of the two categories—namely, companies limited by shares, or companies limited by guarantee without a share capital. Therefore, if they cannot become public companies, they will be totally boxed in. They will not be able to change to another category and within that category the intention would be that they could not become public companies, so they would not be able to offer shares and debentures to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will agree that, as there are such companies in existence, we ought to treat them fairly and permit them to remain or to become public companies. That, I believe, is right and proper and perfectly consistent with the policy I set out earlier that we should not allow any more of these companies to be set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances, I wonder whether, in view of my rather lengthy explanation, my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby will be content to withdraw his amendment, even though the provisions to which his amendments relate may be relevant to only a tiny handful of companies. We are talking not about a big problem but about a group of companies which do exist, and we see no reason why they should not be allowed to continue to exist and why they should not be given the option. I hope my right hon. Friend will feel that this is a more sensible arrangement than at first might appear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is extremely grateful to my hon. Friend for his—I am not being rude—lecture on this part of company law. He said, rightly, that I was proposing in the amendments a simpler way of doing what he wishes to do under the Bill. My simpler way was to leave the company limited by guarantee with a share capital controlled by the 1948 Act, which seemed to do all that was necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had also in mind, as my hon. Friend thought, whether it should be done at all—whether we should continue to have private companies limited by guarantee with a share capital and allow them to become public companies. When the recommen-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0046">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
dation so many years ago was that we should not go on with this type of company, or at least we should not form any more, I take it that they were not persona grata with the Jenkins committee and they should not be encouraged. Do we really, then, want to encourage them by saying "You can become a public company now. You can have the status of a public company."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I have raised some doubt, as I hope I have, in my hon. Friend's mind as to whether we ought to do that and whether those companies should be permitted to take on different status—as I understand, they have no status, either public or private, at the moment—it is a little puzzling to see how such a company would become a private company under the Bill if it does not want to become a public company. Does it just remain as a company limited by guarantee with a share capital without putting PLC after its name? If it decides to become a public company—which I would hope the Bill would prevent—there will be a fascinating name, for instance, "Jones & Company, Limited by guarantee with a share capital, Public limited company". It will be a terrible mouthful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do we really need those companies any more? There are very few of them. The company limited by guarantee without a share capital is, of course, extremely popular with institutions and societies and that type of thing, and there are many of them. But those limited by guarantee with a share capital are so few that we might reasonably have said that they shall not continue to exist for a great length of time and they certainly should not be encouraged to become public companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having aired the point, however, and hoping that I have put a thought into my hon. Friend's mind, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to raise a number of points on clause stand part which can be encapsulated by my saying that it seems that the clause as drafted has departed in a number of respects from the clause, which I thought was fairly uncontentious, in the previous Bill, in particular subsections (2),(3) and (4). It might be of
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
assistance if the Minister were to indicate why these departures were made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 2 is the one which in subsection (2) introduces the title which will have to be set after every public company in future—"Public limited company"—which is already being reduced to the initials "PLC". Anything more inelegant I cannot imagine. One has but to think of some of our famous names among public companies, the banks, the institutions, the insurance companies, and imagine them all having to put "PLC" after their names. They will have to rip down the plates and fascia boards outside their buildings to replate them or reset them to put "PLC" after the names, alter all their headings and so on. It goes beyond comprehension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that under the directive, which the Bill follows, we have to distinguish a public company from any other company, but I should have thought that the wit of man could have devised something better than "PLC" after every name to distinguish public companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I turn first to the point raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, you would.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, he always raises extremely interesting points and I feel compelled to answer them as soon as I have heard them. I live in hope that all sorts of other thoughts may occur to me as I do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument which my right hon. Friend has put forward has been put to us strongly both in opposition and in government. The CBI perhaps summed up everyone's predicament when it said in a submission to us when we were in opposition that it did not like the phrase "PLC" but it could not think of a better one. That is the problem. Nobody really likes the idea very much. It is necessary as a result of the second directive to distinguish between public and private companies. In fact, after a great deal of searching and an open invitation to everyone to submit a better suggestion, no better suggestion was forthcoming, merely criticism of the one that had been chosen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will represent a change. We shall try to make the transition more easy. We shall make some changes which will give com-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
panies more time to use up their stocks of labels, notepaper and so on, so that they will not be put at too much of a disadvantage. We shall try to alleviate that burden as much as we can, but the change must be made, and that is the chosen name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to the point raised by the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) stems precisely from that. Most of the changes that are made in clause 2 are drafting changes, but the principal major change is in subsection (3), which is a concession that the Government propose to ease the period of transition. That is the answer to the hon. Gentleman's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman knows, because he received the representations when he was in government, that there was a great deal of argument about what a disadvantage the change was, particularly for the drug companies, who made a great number of representations about the difficulties they would be in with their huge stocks of labels, materials and so forth. Subsection (3) is the major change and is designed purely to ease that process of conversion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister resolve one other matter which is puzzling my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) and myself? It relates to clause 2(4) in the original Bill, dealing with licences and the power to dispense with what was then the word "limited" in the case of charitable and other companies. Is the answer that there will not be any such licences in future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that there will be but the provision is now in schedule 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>REGISTRATION OF COMPANIES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under clause 3(1) the registrar is required, before he registers a memorandum, to be
	<br><blockquote><p>"satisfied that all the requirements of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
Companies Act in respect of registration and of matters precedent and incidental thereto have been complied with".</p></blockquote>
Indeed, there are other duties that are imposed on the registrar under the remaining provisions of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to know whether this means that the registrar will be required to undertake more considerable work than is called for at present. If so, what extra staff provision is to be made to enable him to undertake that work? We know that one of the options in cutting public expenditure that the Department of Trade is considering is cutting down on the companies registry, limiting the number of people there and doing some other damaging things against the interests of the public and consumers at large which we should deplore if they were carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that the registrar may be required to undertake additional duties. I should like to hear what the hon. Gentleman has to say in that regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little puzzled by the hon. Gentleman's intervention because I do not think that the duties being imposed on the registrar are much greater than those that he has at present. The duties will be almost the same. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the registrar now has to issue a certificate of incorporation. He has to check the documents which are lodged. There may be a short period when there is an increase in the work because a large number of companies will have to make changes, but it would be a relatively short period. We do not feel that this should give rise to any long-term increase in the registrar's work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the second point that the hon. Gentleman made. He knows that we are looking at a range of possible savings. No decisions have been taken, but there are one or two matters that we argued about on the last Companies Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Baker) raised the point in his interesting remarks on Tuesday, saying that a great deal of filing is now done as a result of the 1976 Act which might not be necessary in the case of all companies. It may be possible to relieve companies of a range of burdens of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the hon. Gentleman's point is particularly strong. If there is an increase in the work of the registrar as a result of the transitional changes, it should be a fairly short-term increase. If
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
we make economies in that department, we shall have to recognise that there will have to be a trimming of the work to be done to go with a reduction in the numbers. We know of ways in which that could be done. But that is all speculation. No decisions have been taken, and these matters are still being considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being extraordinarily vague. Surely, even though the Government have been in power for five or six months—too long—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems longer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. and learned Friend is absolutely right—they seem to have given little or no thought to the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that there is likely to be almost no increase in the amount of work but went on to say that such an increase might occur—that it is likely to arise in the transitional period, the duration of which he cannot speculate about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely, the Minister can inform the Committee whether it is proposed that, to get over the already substantial difficulties which the registrar faces in dealing with his present burden of work, he should take on additional staff. If the hon. Gentleman is not proposing that—there will be some additional burden; he has conceded that—will there not be considerable delay in the registrar's other work? Those are matters which the Minister has a duty to explain as soon as possible, not only to the Committee but to others who are interested in the registry's operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such uncertainty can only be damaging. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be rather more forthcoming than he was in his rather vague response to my initial observations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) is making rather heavy weather of the matter. There seems to be no change in clause 3 from the existing law. It may be that on clause 4 it will be worth arguing that there are certain matters which impose a further duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5) of clause 3 enables the registrar—as he does at present—to take a
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
statutory declaration by a solicitor engaged in the formation of a company as evidence of compliance. I am sure that both the Under-Secretary and the hon. Member for Hackney, Central have signed such forms many times, as I have, and that they have been taken by the registrar of companies without question. It seems to me that there is no alteration of existing law in respect of the matters that are covered in clause 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page). That was precisely the point that I was about to make. Subsection (5) gives the registrar the right to accept a statutory declaration from a solicitor.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems a formidable task to discuss so many other amendments with my amendment No. 95. All the amendments on your selection list, Sir Stephen, without the word "Government" in front of them are in my name. Those are the amendments with which I shall deal; I shall not presume to deal with the others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall first explain the intention of my amendments. When a company raises capital by the issuing of shares, it first publishes a prospectus inviting applications. In practice, it then receives the applications, with the money, or at least part of the money, for the shares. To my mind, that is when a company raises the money, and that is the point at which one should consider whether it should be given the required certificate to carry on business—whether it has raised sufficient money to give it enough stability to receive a certificate from the registrar to carry on its business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that stage letters of allotment will be issued, whether the allotment is partly or fully paid up, and no doubt renounceable within period of, say, six weeks or so. When shares are allotted, in practice the money or part of the money has been subscribed, that being the word used in article 6(1) of the second directive. With other member States, we are required by article 6 to
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
ensure that a company has a certain amount of subscribed capital before we authorise it to commence business. I think that I should place on record the terms of paragraph 1 of Article 6:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The laws of the member States shall require that in order that a company may be incorporated or obtain authorisation to commence business a minimum capital shall be subscribed the amount of which shall be not less than 25,000 European units of account."</p></blockquote>
I stress the word "subscribed" because to my mind that relates to what normally happens in an issue. An application is made, with a money deposit, and the shares are allotted. The shares are eventually issued, and either the allottee or the person to whom he has renounced—I hate the word "renouncee" but it is used—is registered as holding those shares. That is after the period of renunciation has expired. Only then could the statutory declaration required in subsection (3) of clause 4 be honestly made, because that declaration has to relate to the shares issued and the money raised on the issue of the shares. I believe that it is only at that stage that the registrar could consider issuing the certificate if the clause remains unamended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of my amendments, and the definition of "allotment" as against "issue", is to give the registrar the power to issue the certificate authorising the company to carry on business when he receives a statutory declaration that so much has been subscribed and the shares allotted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If for that statutory declaration on which the registrar gives his decision we have to wait until the shares are issued, there will be considerable delay. I imagine that there will be a delay of some months in certain cases, because I have known occasions when a considerable time has passed before the allottee has been registered as the shareholder and the shares issued to him. Are we really to wait until that stage before the registrar can even consider issuing the certificate? This would mean, of course, that the company was sitting on the subscriber's money, which would be lying idle for a period when the company could be getting on with the business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe it is necessary for me, when I have described the purpose of these amendments, to go through each one to show how it occurs. I am sure
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0050">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
that, if the purpose is accepted, the draftsmen will not accept my amendments as they stand, although I believe them to be perfect. Therefore, I shall not go through them carefully. I draw attention only to amendment No. 106 which defines "allotment".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, having tried to describe how the money gets into the hands of the company, and having explained that we do not have to wait until shares are issued to see that the company has raised sufficient money, or to see that people have subscribed sufficiently to the company, I hope that the principle of my amendments—indeed, the actual wording of them—will be accepted by my hon. Friend. On the other hand, he may say that the Government amendments do exactly what I desire. I hope that he will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Reginald Eyre)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) has raised a number of important practical points, all of which, I believe, I shall be able to meet satisfactorily in my reply, and I shall at the same time deal with Government amendments Nos. 17, 18, 67, 68 and 78.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These amendments deal with the thorny problem of what is meant by "allot". It was recognised in the 1978 Bill that there was a great degree of complexity behind this simple word. My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby and the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) raised this matter also on Second Reading. It was rightly argued that the position was unsatisfactory and that amendment of the Bill was necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now explain the amendments that the Government propose. There is no controversy on the purpose that we are attempting to achieve. I am sure that the Government's aims are exactly those of my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby, namely, that a company should not be allowed to commit itself unconditionally to issue shares unless certain requirements are met—for example, that the appropriate sum required by the directive has been paid up, as specified in clause 22, that any considerations other than cash received in respect of the shares have been correctly valued, as required by clause 24, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The time when the company becomes
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
unconditionally committed to issue shares may be many months before the shares are actually issued. My right hon. Friend, from his experience, was able to confirm that there is severe difficulty on occasion caused by that delay. This point was made last year by the former Under-Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection, and we are at one on that. But we need to concentrate on the time at which this obligation is entered into.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Government amendments, the last one, No. 78, is the key amendment, and it provides a definition of "allotment":
	<br><blockquote><p>"the shares shall be taken … to be allotted when a person acquires the unconditional right to be included in the company's register of members in respect of those shares."</p></blockquote>
This makes absolutely clear that we are not referring to conditional commitments and that we have tied allotment down to the stage when a company becomes unconditionally committed to issue shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition therefore meets the policy objectives that I have outlined. It also avoids the snags highlighted on the previous formulation. For example, the provision will not interfere with the operation of rights issues, discussed in Committee last year, which may allow for shares to be issued provided that certain payments are made partly before and partly after what is termed an allotment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in such an arrangement the essence is that the applicant has no right to the shares until he has made the further payments due after what is referred to as an allotment. In such an instance, under the definition we propose—this is an important practical point—there would not be an allotment until the further payments had been made, for only at that stage would the person have an unconditional right to have his name entered into the register of members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of that can be put briefly. The present practice of payment up in stages, with no final commitment until all payments have been made, would not fall foul of the provisions in the Bill dealing with allotment because of the new definition of "allotment". I hope, therefore, that the Committee will wel-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0051">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
come Government amendment No. 78, which is the key amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the other amendments concerned with the question of "allot" or "issue". The first two, Nos. 17 and 18, are to clause 6(2). Clause 6 is concerned with the requirements as to the share capital of a private company which must be satisfied before, under clause 5, the company can be reregistered as public. Paragraph (	<i>a</i>) of subsection (1) requires that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the nominal value of the company's issued share capital is not less than the authorised minimum;"</p></blockquote>
and paragraphs (	<i>b</i>), (	<i>c</i>) and (	<i>d</i>) require that allotted shares must be paid up in a certain manner, that is, paid up as to one quarter of the nominal value and the whole of any premium, and that if there is an undertaking to do work or perform services or transfer a non-cash asset, that undertaking has been, or, alternatively, in the latter case will be, performed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point there is that subsection (2) seeks to provide a degree of exemption in cases where the shares have been issued before the end of the transitional period, that is, within I8 months of the coming into operation of these provisions for allotment under an employee share scheme. The principle of such exemptions is not at issue in the amendments. The amendments seek to make the exemptions fully effective in relation to the provisions of subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>) to (	<i>d</i>). Those provisions refer to shares allotted. The exemption, subsection (2), refers to shares issued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Issue, as my right hon. Friend said, comes after allotment and is, so to speak, its completion. The exemption ought to refer to "allotted" and not "issued" to make good the present shortcoming. As drafted, there is no exemption when shares have been allotted before the end of the transitional period but issued thereafter. There is no reason for that. Similarly, the exemption does not apply at all until the shares in question have been issued, whenever they were allotted, because of the use of the word "issued" in line 42. That is also unreasonable, and amendments Nos. 17 and 18 seek to put right those defects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 67 is to clause 31, which applies some of the share capital provisions to certain companies which
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
are in the process of becoming public. The clause also provides transitional savings for contracts made by companies to issue shares if such companies were not registered as public on their original incorporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment we propose is to subsection (2), which provides the transitional savings. The amendment alters the reference to a contract for the issue of shares to a contract for their allotment. Again, this change slightly widens the exemptions allowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, we propose an amendment to clause 33, which is amendment No. 68. The clause provides for the registration of details of special rights attaching to any shares. There is an anomaly in the clause as subsection (1) provides for the registration of certain rights attaching to shares which are allotted after the appointed day. Subsection (5) provides for a statement of similar particulars of shares issued before the appointed day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If shares were allotted but not issued before the appointed day they might fall between the two stools. Therefore, to bring subsection (5) into line we suggest the replacement of "issued" with "allotted".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a lengthy explanation, but it is necessary because there is practical importance in these amendments and their addition will result in a better and more practical working system. This is not an easy topic, but I hope that right hon. and hon. Members in the Committee will welcome the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the amendments tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby, who accurately described his intentions. The effect of his amendments would be to provide a definition of what is meant by "allotment" and to change a number of provisions in the Bill which refer to "issued" rather than "allotted" or "allotted" rather than "issued".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take, first, the definition of "allotment" provided by amendment No. 106. The Committee will see that Government amendment No. 78, to which I have already referred at some length, also provides such a definition. The substance which these amendments seek to achieve is exactly the same. We need to define "allotment" to tie it down to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0052">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
the point where a company is bound—that is, unconditionally committed—to issue shares. We are at one on this. It has major implications throughout the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several requirements which have to be met before a company is allowed to allot shares. We need to ensure that such allotment is the point at which a company is unconditionally hound to issue the shares. If it referred to a conditional obligation, that could greatly inhibit normal commercial practice on the issue of shares. I know that this was an aspect which my right hon. Friend had very much in mind when he tabled his amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two amendments Nos. 106 and 78 are both intended to meet this point. Although they are not hugely dissimilar, on balance Government amendment No. 78 has a slight edge. First, it focuses on the unconditional right, and I believe that to be very important. Second, the amendment is phrased in terms of the right of the person to be included in the company's register of members in respect of the shares. It is this event, that is, inclusion on the register, rather than the delivering of the share certificate, which is the significant move in company law terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 106 could, with respect, be understood to refer to the delivering of the share certificate, and for this reason I have a preference for the Government amendment. We certainly agree with the intention. A definition of "allotment" will make a considerable improvement to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the related but separate questions raised by the other amendments tabled by my right hon. Friend. The first half-dozen amendments, Nos. 95 to 100, change references to "issued" to "allotted". Amendment No. 98 changes a reference in clause 4(2)(	<i>b</i>). We certainly would agree with this, were it not for the fact that we have come to the conclusion that this paragraph is superfluous and there is, therefore, a Government amendment, No. I, to delete it. I hope that this will not upset my right hon. Friend too much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other amendments change references to "issued share capital" to "allotted share capital", and these points were suggested by the Law Society, as my right hon. Friend knows. I was very interested to see what the
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
Law Society had to say and to hear the points made by my right hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The references in question are clause 4(2)(	<i>a</i>) and 4(3)(	<i>a</i>), clause 6(1)(	<i>a</i>), clause 8(11) and clause 12(1). Clause 4(2)(	<i>a</i>) states that the registrar has to be satisfied, before he can issue a certificate to the company to do business, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the nominal value of the company's issued share capital is not less than the authorised minimum".</p></blockquote>
In this clause we are concerned with public companies, registered as such on their original incorporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 95 provides that the criterion should be the nominal value of the allotted share capital rather than the issued share capital. This is essentially a practical detail. Either would be permitted by the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not think that it is unreasonable to ask a company going public from scratch to have finished the formalities for £50,000-worth of share capital. The problem arises from the possible delay between allotment of the share and the registering of the name of the holder in the register of members. There is an easy way round this, as the Law Society recognises in its paper, which is to issue shares with a nominal value equal to or greater than the authorised minimum and to obtain payment to the extent of at least 25 per cent. before publishing the prospectus. This would avoid the delay about which there is concern. This should not, therefore, be a problem, particularly when one bears in mind the scale of operation with which one is concerned in a company going public from scratch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 98, which proposes to change "issued" to "allotted" in clause 4(3)(	<i>a</i>), will follow the eventual amendment No. 95.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the other instances, in clauses 6, 8 and 12 there would not seem to be a problem at all, although in a sense these amendments would be consequential. These clauses are the provisions for private companies and old public companies re-registering as public and for the reduction of a public company's capital below the authorised minimum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of a company already trading, there is not the same problem as arises on clause 4—that of not being able to start business before the necessary capital requirements for a public company have been complied with. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0053">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
argument is that days are essential in public flotations, but the same arguments do not apply in the present case. The requirement to have £50,000 issued share capital rather than £50,000 of allotted share capital, therefore, would not cause difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby has proposed a series of amendments which would change the references in clause 22 from the allotment of shares to the issue of shares. These are amendments Nos. 101 to 105. Clause 22 requires public companies not to allot their shares unless at least one-quarter of the share capital and the whole of the premium is paid up. I believe that in substance there is little, if anything, between my right hon. Friend and myself, even though I do not think that these amendments are necessary. I say this because I believe that the Government amendments, and amendment No. 78 in particular, which is very important and defines the time of allotment, meet the point that he seeks to make. What we both want to ensure is that companies should remain free to seek part payment on subscription for their shares provided that they do not become committed unconditionally before the required level of payment is received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I explained more fully when moving amendment No. 78, we do not wish to interfere with such arrangements. That is why the definition of "allot" in amendment No. 78 is so important. By requiring an unconditional right to be entered in the register of members, allotment under clause 22 does not take place until the company unconditionally commits itself. Therefore, the company will properly and safely be able to require payment in stages provided that it specifies that it is to receive the minimum, which we all know about, required by clause 22 before it commits itself unconditionally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that it was that very point which prompted my right hon. Friend to suggest moving back from "allot" in the clause to "issue". However, I hope that I have clearly set out the reasons for concluding that the definition of allotment deals with the points under discussion. Therefore, against the
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
background of this lengthy, complicated and technical explanation, I hope that my right hon. Friend will not press the amendments in his name.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to my hon. Friend for that exposition of the situation and for going so carefully into the amendments that both he and I have tabled. In order to keep matters as simple as possible, I shall not embark on arguing with him or explaining to the Committee about the amendments on the later clauses, but I shall merely concentrate on two amendments on clause 4, because they seem to be quite simple. To some extent I do not believe that my hon. Friend has satisfied me on those two amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first one is amendment No. 95 and that is in clause 4(2)(	<i>a</i>). I have said that I entirely accept the definition in amendment No. 78—at least, at any rate, until I have studied it further in the light of what was said by my hon. Friend. However, it seems to me that this is the right definition. Having got that definition—that "allotment" is when the company has bound itself unconditionally to issue the shares—we come to clause 4(2)(	<i>a</i>) where the registrar has to be satisfied, before he gives the certificate for the company to commence business, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the nominal value of the company's issued share capital is not less than the authorised minimum".</p></blockquote>
The most that article 6, paragraph 1, of the second directive requires—we shall assume, for the moment, that the other member States have carried out the requirements of that article—is that a certain sum of money shall have been subscribed. As I tried to indicate earlier, there may have been a lapse of time between the money being subscribed—in fact, there will invariably have been a lapse of time—and the actual issue of the share certificates and the registering of the man's name in the company's register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, if the registrar has to be satisfied about an amount of issued share capital before he issues his certificate, it still means, as I tried to explain earlier, that the company may be sitting on subscribed money for a considerable time without being able to start its business. I do not see that it would cause any damage to the principles enunciated by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0054">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
my hon. Friend if we had "allotted" there instead of "issued".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applies in subsection (3) of clause 4. I am very grateful to my hon. Friend for smoothing the way for the statutory declaration, in that he has removed from the registrar the requirement of seeing that the one-quarter amount has been subscribed. In other words, by Government amendments we are removing paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of clause 4(2) and relying on the statutory declaration—or, rather, it is a written statement, I see—in the prescribed form, signed by a director or secretary, that the amount required has, indeed, been paid up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In subsection (3)(	<i>a</i>) there is the phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the amount paid up, at the time of the application, on the issued share capital of the company".</p></blockquote>
The person signing cannot say what the issued share capital of the company is and therefore he cannot say what is the amount paid up on the application for it until it has been issued. Again, there is a delay between the application—when usually the money is sent—followed by the allotment, and a further delay between the allotment and the actual issue of share certificates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would not harm the principle enunciated by my hon. Friend if that were the share capital which has been allotted at the time when the written statement is made and at the time when the registrar receiving that written statement has to consider whether to issue the certificate authorising the company to carry on business. Therefore, I ask my hon. Friend to look again at those two instances where the word "issue" occurs, in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) of subsection (2) and in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) of subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may say again how grateful I am for the very full way in which my hon. Friend has dealt with this group of amendments, and for his very clear explanation of the Government's intentions. I have no desire at all to damage those intentions. I am merely trying to look at the matter from a practical point of view, having been involved in this exercise on behalf of companies, and to fit it in with present practice without disturbing that practice too much, and at the same time to fall in line with the second directive of the EEC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It will not be possible for the Committee to debate in great detail the points that my right hon. Friend has made. However, in the light of the strong feelings that he has expressed, I am prepared to look at the question again sympathetically and to consider very carefully all the points that he has made, and if necessary to come forward with amendments at the appropriate time. I hope that that will satisfy my right hon. Friend.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the amendment is to delete Clause 4(2)(	<i>b</i>). This clause is concerned with the requirements as to share capital which a public company registered as such on its original incorporation has to fulfil before it receives a certificate from the registrar that the various requirements have been met, and consequently it is allowed to do business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>) states that one point
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
on which the registrar must be satisfied is that
	<br><blockquote><p>"not less than one-quarter of the nominal value of each issued share in the company, together with the whole of any premium on any such share, has been received by the company".</p></blockquote>
However, clause 22 states that a public company may not allot a share unless it is paid up in this way. A public company registered as such on its original incorporation would, therefore, have to meet this requirement anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that there is no point in restating that commitment in clause 4. The amendment is therefore simply removing an unnecessary underlining of a point already covered elsewhere in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would, I think, be clearest if we looked first at the central amendment, No. 55, which operates on clause 22(1). This states the general rule about the payment up on allotment of the shares of public limited companies as to 25 per cent. of their nominal value, together with the whole of any premium. Certain of the other amendments concern broadly parallel provisions applied to companies in the course of becoming public limited companies, and others deal with related matters. to which I shall return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As drafted, clause 22(1) spells out explicitly. and in some detail. what is meant by talking of a share being paid up as to one-quarter of its nominal value together with the whole of any premium. It refers to the nominal value and the premium being received by the company. It goes on to make clear that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0056">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
nominal value and premium received by the company may be in cash or other wise, and may be paid to the company or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On reflection, it seems to us that this can be considerably simplified on the lines proposed by our amendment No. 55. The basis of the amendment is that it does not change the substance of clause 22(1) as it now stands, and is to that extent a drafting amendment. It represents a considerable improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me take the weaknesses of the present draft in turn. First, it speaks of one-quarter of the nominal value and the whole of the premium being "received" by the company. This is highly elliptical. What it means is that an amount equal to that nominal value and premium has been received by the company in order to pay up that nominal value and premium on the share. Put simply, that means that the shares are paid up as to one-quarter of the nominal value and the whole of the premium. If that is what we mean, why not say it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, the subsection as drafted expressly lays down that what is received may be received either in cash or otherwise. While that is so, there is in fact no need to have to say so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the subsection makes clear that what is received by the company may be paid to the company or another. At first sight, that is rather strange. How can something be received by the company and paid to another? The reason for making this point was to protect the present position under which payments to third parties, whether subsidiaries or not, may perfectly properly serve to pay up shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem arises from the use of the word received ". As I have already explained, that word looks at the wrong part of the transaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All these points on the present Bill are met in amendment No. 55, which is much more straightforward and which is also much more in accord with the usage elsewhere in the Companies Acts. I have in mind particularly section 52 of the 1948 Act, which deals with the return as to allotments which has to be made to the registrar of companies. That, for example, talks in subsection 1(	<i>a</i>) of
	<br><blockquote><p>"the amount paid … on each share (whether on account of the nominal value or by way of premium)".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
I turn now to the other amendments. Amendment No. 4 restates subsection (4) of clause 4 in a more direct fashion, without changing the policy. In doing so, it operates directly instead of by reference to subsection 2(	<i>b</i>) which has been removed by the amendments just discussed. Subsection 2(	<i>b</i>) did, of course, follow clause 22(1) as presently drafted, but amendment No. 55 changes clause 22(1) to refer to shares being allotted
	<br><blockquote><p>"as paid up at least as to one-quarter of the nominal value of the share and the whole of any premium on it".</p></blockquote>
Similarly, amendment No. 13, which relates to the capital of a private company which wishes to be re-registered as public, and amendment No. 21, which relates to the capital of an old public company which wishes to be re-registered as public, both follow the new phraseology proposed for clause 22(1). I am sure that that must be an improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 19 would remove clause 6(4). Clause 6(4) is in the Bill because of the drafting of clause 6(1)(	<i>b</i>) and, in particular, the requirement that the company should have "received" one-quarter of the nominal value of each share allotted. When a company issues bonus shares by capitalising accumulated profits and other reserves, it is very hard to say that, by rearranging its balance sheet liabilities, it has "received" anything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, to ensure that the issue of bonus shares did not prevent private companies from becoming public limited companies, clause 6(4) was necessary. Broadly speaking, it says that where shares are paid up by way of bonus, that sum shall be treated as received by the company. Right hon. and hon. Members will see that if, as we propose, clause 6(1)(	<i>b</i>) refers not to "received" but to "paid up", clause 6(4) is no longer necessary. Bonus shares are indeed paid up and no special provision is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two small drafting amendments to clause 20. These are amendments Nos. 52 and 53. They are consequential on the changes to other provisions of the Bill. One of the changes that they bring about is that they now refer, as in the other amendments presently under discussion, to
	<br><blockquote><p>"accept … in payment up of its shares or any premium on them, an undertaking … ".</p></blockquote>
and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, in subsection 3(	<i>a</i>), amendment no. 53 also replaces the phrase "pay … for those shares" with "pay …
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0057">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
in respect of those shares". It was explained to the Committee, in discussion on the group of amendments which included amendment No. 14 to clause 6, that the phrase "pay for those shares" is not wide enough to cover payment of the premium. In the present case, payment of premium needs to be covered, hence the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally on this group, amendment No. 65 removes subsection (2) of clause 30. That subsection provides that a company and its officers would not be in breach of clause 22 by reason of not having receiving any amount if they had received a cheque in good faith without suspecting that it would eventually be dishonoured. This provision, once again, was necessitated by the reference to "received" in clause 22. Indeed, the defence is specifically tied to a reference to "received any amount". With the removal of the reference in clause 22 to "received", the defence is no longer necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be very brief because my group of amendments, amendments Nos. 107, which is to clause 5, 108, to clause 20, and 109 and 110, to clause 24, are drafting amendments attacking the word "accept".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have endeavoured to provide in each of those amendments an alternative to the word "accept" because clause 5(5) applies where a company has, on the allotment of shares, accepted in payment a non-cash asset or an undertaking to transfer such an asset. That does not seem to be appropriately described by the word "accepted". "Accepted" requires some assent or consent by the person to whom the asset or undertaking is offered. In many cases, one cannot point to any particular specific consent by the company. The acceptance is by implied action of the company rather than having to point to some document whereby it is accepted. I do not believe that it would do any harm to the clauses to which I have tabled these amendments if the word "accepted" were rejected from them. Instead of the clause
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
biting, if I may so put it, when the acceptance is made, it should bite when the allotment is made. That is what I have endeavoured to put in the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for the points that he has raised and in seeking to reply to them I shall try not to be as provocative as I was in my last contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of amendments Nos. 107, 109 and 110 would be to remove references in clauses 5 and 24 to the acceptance of a consideration in payment for shares. If the amendments to these clauses that the Government are proposing are accepted, that word will no longer be used in those places. Therefore, I hope that my right hon. Friend will agree not to press his amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of amendment No. 108 would be to remove the word "accept" from clause 20(2). That was one of the points made by the Law Society about the Bill and I am very glad that my right hon. Friend has made it. The first question is whether the word "accept" means what we intend it to mean and no more. The Law Society cites the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, which says that the word means
	<br><blockquote><p>"to take or receive with consenting mind".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very dangerous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I believe that the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary has just about got it right. That is what we mean in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society goes on to say that it seems to follow that the word requires some act of the company confirming that the consideration has discharged the obligation in respect of the amount payable on the shares. That is the objection to the word. With respect to the Law Society, we do not think that that follows. Therefore, we consider that "accept" is a perfectly correct word to use in the context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should point out that clause 20(2) needs to relate not only to payment on allotment but to payment at any time in respect of the shares. Article 7 of the directive, which prohibits payment by way of undertakings to perform work or supply services, applies to any payments in respect of snares. This point would, I fear, be lost in the amendment. I hope that my right hon. Friend will agree that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0058">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
the word "accept" is satisfactory in the context and therefore, having considered the points that I have made—particularly with reference to the dictionary—will not press his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, what my hon. Friend has said raises the question of the age of consent. I do not think that that would be in order either on the Bill or on the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, I am not satisfied on the point. I still think that if it were questioned whether a company had or had not accepted, one would have to point to a specific Act or document under which the company had accepted. In practice, there is no such Act or document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the Government amendments make my amendments unnecessary in certain places. However, if we are not to remove the word "acceptance" from the Bill, I should hope that some further qualification of the word might be given. Therefore, I should like to consider carefully what my hon. Friend has said. It seems to me that if one were to qualify the word "acceptance" with the phrase "specific or implied", or something similar, that might solve the problem. In the meantime, I shall not press my amendments in this group, in the hope that the Government amendments will achieve what I wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This group of amendments represents an attempt to simplify the Bill and to remove unnecessary passages from it. There are two provisions in the Bill under which applications can be made to the court to wind up a company, and there are two new grounds for making those applications which stem directly from the changes being made as a result of the second directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The opportunity to make those applications for winding up are contained in clauses 4(8) and 9(3). But, as at present drafted, they do not fit easily into the general provisions in the Companies Act 1948 on which one might see grounds for winding up a company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these amendments we therefore propose two things. We propose to drop some words from the provisions. The provisions, as then amended, will then be removed from the Bill altogether and added to the 1948 Act. It will help a great deal when we come to a consolidation measure if we have provisions drawn in an identical fashion attached to the 1948 Act instead of having provisions scattered throughout various pieces of legislation and using slightly different wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I briefly illustrate the point. Under both provisions a person may apply to the court and
	<br><blockquote><p>"if in the court's opinion it is just and equitable … to do so"</p></blockquote>
the court may give relief. We believe that those words are unnecessary, because the court would not give relief unless it con-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0059">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
sidered that the application had been made on grounds which were just and equitable. Therefore, we believe that there is unnecessary verbiage in parts of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We therefore propose that the two separate grounds at present contained in clauses 4 and 9 should be added to the list which appears in section 222 of the 1948 Act. This group of amendments has that effect. The amendments tidy up the provisions and propose that they be inserted in the 1948 Act instead of in this Bill..
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make one further point. I believe that it is necessary to ask ourselves why the right to petition should be restricted to the Secretary of State. There seems to be no sensible reason why that should be the case. Therefore, the amendment directed to section 224 of the 1948 Act permits the Secretary of State to petition in these cases, but section 224 itself also permits the company, creditors and contributories to do so. The remaining amendments are drafting amendments.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All these amendments deal with a fairly minor point, but it is one that we feel needs to be corrected and which, if corrected, will help the consolidation of the Companies Acts which I am sure we all feel is long overdue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem arises because a number of provisions in the Bill and in the Companies Acts dealing with changes in a company's memorandum or articles refer to "alterations" in the memorandum but to "alterations in or additions to" the articles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could give a number of illustrations of this, but perhaps a good one can be found in clause 5(2)(	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>). We believe that this is unnecessary for the articles of association of a company which comprise a number of regulations. The addition of a new regulation is an alteration to the articles. Therefore, in our view, there is no need to talk of "additions to" and "alterations in" and this, again, is unnecessary verbiage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, not only is the verbiage unnecessary but it is not used consistently
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
throughout the various Acts towards the consolidation of which we all look forward. In a number of places in different Acts sometimes it appears as "alterations and additions" and sometimes just as "alterations". We seek to be consistent. Therefore, in our amendments we are removing unnecessary words and paving the way for consolidation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 72 also incorporates another small change. Clause 47(5) already assumes that subsections (3) and (4) give power to alter the memorandum and articles. However, they also give power to require the company not to alter them. The amendment recognises this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 31 and 80 incorporate similar changes in respect of clause 11(8) and section 5 of the 1948 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 87 and 91 have this same objective, again, of simplifying some of the verbiage. In this case there is a reference to altering "or adding" to forms, and this, believe it or not, goes back to section 71 of the 1862 Act. We believe that these amendments will achieve the desired end of simplification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn finally to amendment No. 92A. We believe that this considerably simplifies section 44(2) of the 1967 Act. This is possible as a result of clause 1(2) of the current Bill which provides that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On or after the appointed day, no company may be formed as, or become, a company limited by guarantee with a share capital"</p></blockquote>
and also because of the removal of references to "additions" to the articles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with these amendments rather hurriedly. I believe that it would not be in the interests of the Committee to deal with them in any other way. They all have the basic objective of simplifying and removing unnecessary verbiage, and I hope that the Committee will find it possible to accept them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The common feature of these amendments is that they are all concerned with cases where shares are allotted for a consideration other than cash.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I deal first with amendment No. 58, which amends clause 24(1). Clause 24 is an important clause which requires a report by an independent expert before
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
a public company allots shares for a consideration other than cash. Once again, the issue that we face is one of simplification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 24(1) as drafted deals expressly with a variety of circumstances in which the company may allot shares, in effect, for a consideration other than cash. However, instead of using the brief description
	<br><blockquote><p>"paid up … otherwise than in cash"</p></blockquote>
the subsection refers to six cases identified. These are, first, transfer of a non-cash asset to the company; second, undertaking to transfer a non-cash asset to the company; third, transfer of a non-cash asset to another person; fourth, undertaking to transfer a non-cash asset to another person; fifth, payment of cash to another person; sixth, undertaking to pay cash to another person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the provision as drafted goes on to make clear that where one is concerned with the transfer of a non-cash asset to the company or an undertaking to transfer such an asset to the company, what is to be valued as the consideration is the asset or the undertaking. However, where in the other cases the asset is transferred or is promised to be transferred to another party, what is valued as the consideration is the advantage to the company of the transfer or the undertaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While that puts the matter on a very explicit basis, a number of points arise. First, and most important, the second directive in the relevant articles, namely article 10 and article 27(2), calls for the report on all "considerations other than cash". While non-cash asset is given a wide definition in clause 56(1) and (2) of the Bill—indeed, there are amendments that have widened that definition—it is not absolutely certain that "non-cash asset" is sufficiently wide to cover all considerations other than cash.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, and almost as important, is the point that
	<br><blockquote><p>"paid up otherwise than in cash"</p></blockquote>
is a well known concept in United Kingdom company law. It is found in section 52(2)(	<i>b</i>) of the Companies Act 1948 dealing with the return as to allotments—
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the case of shares allotted as fully or partly paid up otherwise than in cash."</p></blockquote>
That provision is well established and understood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of those two major con-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0062">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
siderations, we have come to the conclusion that the better course is to rely on the established concepts, which are well understood and which should bring the Bill into line with other parts of the Companies Acts. The change is one of drafting, for with this amendment, together with certain amendments to the definitions in clause 56 to which we shall come later, the effect of the Bill will not be changed. In my view, however, it will be much more straightforward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the other amendments. Amendment No. 8 amends subsection (5) of clause 5. The purpose of that subsection is broadly to require a valuation, as under clause 24, when a private company allots shares paid up otherwise than in cash, in rather special circumstances. This is where it is proposing to apply for re-registration as a public limited company. The substance of its capital as up to the date of the latest balance sheet is vouched for by an auditor's certificate under subsection 3(	<i>b</i>) but if after the date of that balance sheet—but before the special resolution that it should apply for re-registration as public—it proposes to allot shares as paid up otherwise than in cash, subsection (5) calls for an expert's report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 8 seeks to bring the drafting of subsection (5) into line with that of clause 24, as amended. Hence it proposes to speak of—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where shares are allotted by the company between the balance sheet date and the passing of the special resolution as fully or partly Paid up as to their nominal value or any premium on them otherwise than in cash."</p></blockquote>
Amendments Nos. 9 and 10, also to that subsection, are minor drafting amendments consequential on the first amendment to subsection 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 130, 38 and 39 relate to clause 16. This provision, called for by the second directive, is hardly one of the high points of the Bill. It calls for public companies not to allot shares in pursuance of an offer, unless the offer is fully taken up or unless the terms of the offer permitted allotment when not fully taken up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals with the consequences when the offer is not fully taken up, and in subsection (3) deals with the case where the shares are offered as payable wholly or in part otherwise than in cash. Having used that
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
term expressly in lines 22 and 23 on page 21, it goes on to refer to "non-cash assets" in lines 30 and 31, and "such an asset" in lines 32 and 33.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of what we are doing on clause 24 and elsewhere, consistency requires that we should change these references to "consideration other than cash" That is what we have done. In one respect, however, amendment No. 130 deals with an unrelated point. It would be best to deal with it at this stage, and I hope that the Committee will agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subsection envisages that the consideration paid by applicants should be returned to them if there is to be no allotment because the offer is not fully taken up. If it cannot be returned, there is to be a payment of money equal in value. That is straightforward. But what if the consideration takes the form of an undertaking to pay cash or to do some other thing? Nothing has been paid or done—all that has happened is that the company has received an undertaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, what should happen is that the undertaking should be released by the company. The risk is that, without an express reference to that, it could be argued that as it is not possible to return an undertaking, the company has to pay a sum equal to the value of the consideration. Such an argument is, perhaps, far-fetched, but it seems best to put the matter beyond doubt. This is what amendment No. 130 does, by equating with the return of any other consideration so received the release of any undertaking so given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now return to the mainstream of this group of amendments. Amendment No. 59, to subsection 7(	<i>d</i>) of clause 24, merely brings that provision into line with clause 24(1) as it is proposed to amend it. Therefore, instead of referring to the value of the consideration, together with any cash to be paid for the shares on allotment, it refers to the consideration and cash by which the nominal value of the shares or any premium payable on them is to be paid up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, amendment No. 144 brings clause 24(10) into line with clause 24(1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, amendment No. 66 is consequential on the simplification of clause
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0063">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
24(1). In clause 30(3), which operates to protect undertakings given in, or in connection with, payment for shares, there is a reference to an undertaking
	<br><blockquote><p>"to transfer any consideration other than cash to the company or any consideration to another".</p></blockquote>
This reflects clause 24(1) as presently drafted, but now that that subsection has been changed, the reference can be simplified to an undertaking
	<br><blockquote><p>"to do any other thing"</p></blockquote>
That is what the amendment does in the interest of simplification. I therefore commend the amendments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my hon. Friend will confirm that all he has been saying applies only to public companies except between the issue of a balance sheet of a private company on which it is requesting to go public and the time that it goes public.

Friend's brilliant—if I may say so—exposition and think that it all applies to private companies, it may shock them. As I see it, my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I shall not be intruding too much on the Committee if I raise one or two points which are giving me some concern in connection with clause 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I ask my hon. Friend whether he really thinks it necessary to use the form of a special resolution, or whether it would be sufficient for private companies wishing to become public companies to obtain an ordinary resolution on special notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While he is considering that point, may I put two other matters to him? It seems that at this point in the Bill it would be appropriate to offer to a private company wishing to change its status not simply the option of reregistering itself as a public company but also that of moving on to corporate partnership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are my hon. Friend's thoughts on corporate partnership sufficiently clear and definite for us to contemplate, perhaps on Report, the inclusion of an amendment in line 3 on page 5 so that the words would read
	<br><blockquote><p>"may be re-registered as a public company or as a corporate partnership"?</p></blockquote>
There is no time like the present. If the Minister feels that that is a valuable suggestion—or even one which some companies might wish to adopt at their own discretion—would this not be the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0064">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
moment to open the way? I think that it probably would.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have great faith in the wisdom of people who make a move of this kind at their own discretion, and I think that an opportunity for experiment would be useful. I would therefore be grateful if, at this point or perhaps at some later stage in our proceedings, my hon. Friend would give us his views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third question concerns the phrase "the relevant balance sheet" and the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"the amount of the company's net assets".</p></blockquote>
I think that this is the first point in the Bill at which it is appropriate to bring up the question of inflation and the valuation of assets. Sooner or later, we must face that. It seems to me that we ought to be facing it, or to know clearly what we think, in our discussion of clause 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that the experts are divided on the question of inflation accounting, but they have been for years, and if they are left to themselves will continue to be divided and indecisive on inflation accounting for years to come. But I do not think that Parliament can allow the situation to continue in which the majority of British companies are either unprofitable or are working at a loss, many of them without knowing it. If inflation is proceeding at the rate of 1 per cent. a month or more, this must be a matter of concern now, and not at some future date when we come back to the question of company law in this Parliament or a later one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like my hon. Friend to say whether he would be willing to contemplate the inclusion of a provision in the Bill to focus the minds of the board on the fact that the balance sheet and financial statements that they produce may be virtually meaningless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gather—having observed a smile, a nod and a wink from the Parliamentary Private Secretary—that it may be for the convenience of some members of the Committee if I come in now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want simply to repeat the question that I was berated for asking in the debate on clause 3. We are now on clause 5 stand part, and my comment about the companies registry applies equally to this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems clear that certain additional
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
burdens will fall on the registrar, so I need not rehearse my question. I am sure that it is still in the Minister's mind. I should like to know what he has to say now. I believe that he owes the Committee a duty to particularize what he has said about the effect of the additional burden of work on the companies registry, additional staffing that may be necessary, the consequence of additional burdens being undertaken by the same number of staff and so on. I hope that the Minister can now reply not only to me but to his hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams)—which, from the Minister's point of view, is more important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to raise one or two matters on clause 5 as well as comment on the question raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) as to whether a special resolution is necessary. I believe that a special resolution is necessary in these circumstances, as a substantial step is being taken. But I wonder whether some of the other provisions in the clause are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The special resolution has to deal with the matters mentioned in subsection (2), which look formidable—the alteration of the company's memorandum and so on—but which may in fact be very small. There may be only one line saying that the company is a public company, and the rest of the memorandum may not need much alteration. Yet the document that has to be delivered under subsection 3(	<i>a</i>) is
	<br><blockquote><p>"a printed copy of the memorandum and articles as altered … in pursuance of the resolution".</p></blockquote>
If one is altering the memorandum and articles in the normal way, it can be done by means of a printed slip stating the resolution and attached to the existing copy. Having regard to the present cost of printing, we ought not to throw any greater burden on a company that is changing from private to public, and indeed is positively forced to do so by the Bill. The company may not particularly want to do so but, having regard to its condition, it may find, from a practical point of view, that it is necessary. The company will have to go to the quite considerable expense of all the rest of the provisions in the clause—auditors, legal advice—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0065">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is wrong with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—General accountancy advice and so on. I declare an interest, of course. The more advice a company has to get, the better pleased I am from the financial point of view, but not from the public service point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can we, therefore, trim down the clause so that the least possible expense falls on the private company becoming public when it is a simple case?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I refer to subsection (3)(	<i>e</i>):
	<br><blockquote><p>"a statutory declaration in the prescribed form by not less than two directors of the company".</p></blockquote>
Why two directors? Is not the secretary capable of doing that? It is in these small practical matters that I am sure we can assist companies by streamlining the clause as much as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) asked why there had to be a special resolution. My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) gave, as one would expect from a person of his experience, exactly the right answer. This major decision is one which ought to be taken by the majority that is necessary to carry a special resolution. It is as important a decision as any which shareholders take about their company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Kensington, with his inimitable persistence, talked about his corporate partnership. If he reads what I said in earlier debates in Committee on this subject, I hope that he will feel that, by the standards of Committees discussing company law, I gave his idea a warm reception. I shall say no more on that subject for the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that my hon. Friend is trying to tempt me on the question of inflation accounting. In Committee on the last Bill, we had a fascinating three-hour debate on the subject. I am sure that you, Sir Stephen, remember virtually every word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Word for word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's point is a valid one. It would be a very backward board of directors which was not now aware that, in looking at its
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
results, it ought to start taking into account the effect of inflation. The accountancy profession is moving quite well down a promising road. So I do not believe that we need to legislate on that subject. Progress is being made, and, again, my hon. Friend deserves much credit for the progress that is being made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister, whose views on all these subjects are decidedly progressive. But I should like to help him to be a little more progressive sometimes. I hope that he does not resent my pressure too much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take note of what has been said about the special resolution. Clearly, it has been a feature of company law for a long time and it has not proved an insuperable obstacle. So I shall not press the suggestion that that might be weakened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's invitation to continue with the concept of the corporate partnership is encouraging. I accept his encouragement and will act upon it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of inflation accounting, I remember the comments which were written about—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. From time to time in this Committee we have the opportunity of hearing the hon. Gentleman make speeches. But this is meant to be an intervention, not a speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that it would be difficult to go over such rocky terrain faster than I am travelling. I thought that I was covering a lot of ground very quickly in my seven-league boots. May I say, briefly, that I am not satisfied that inflation accounting is a matter which should be left aside in Committee, and I intend to table an amendment to a later clause. I hope that that amendment will find your favour, Sir Stephen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention, which succeeded in two respects—asking a number of questions, and answering them at the same time. I hope that he will forgive me if I make no further comment on what he haid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby raised a number of detailed points on the clause. He asked whether
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0066">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
it was really necessary for these matters to be printed. In fact, it is a requirement of the first directive that they should be printed, but I assure him that the registry is taking a very generous view of what the word "printed" means. The registrar is anxious not to see companies put to unnecessary expense and is trying to be as helpful as he can on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question "Why two directors?", perhaps that should have been asked in 1948, because that was when the practice was started. In this Bill, with a view to helping consolidation, we are trying to maintain as much of the 1948 Act as possible. I think that it was a very good question from my right hon. Friend and, from my own point of view, I shall ask about it. He has raised an important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister departs from the points made by the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), particularly on the question of printing, I should like to pursue that matter. The Minister said that the registrar will take a generous view of the term "printing". I have no doubt that he will, but I think that companies need some sort of guidance, because the point being made by the right hon. Gentleman, as I understood it, was that they should be able to avoid undertaking unnecessary expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless companies are given some guidance in the first place by the registrar, they will no doubt interpret the word "printing" in the normal way. Undoubtedly, the Under-Secretary will be able to consult the Oxford English Dictionary, as will the companies. However, I believe that the document will not be produced in any other way but will be printed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that the Minister of State is trying to say that the registrar will perhaps permit duplication or perhaps even typewritten documents. Nevertheless, I believe that some sort of guidance is expressly required. Perhaps the Minister will take a view of the matter subsequently, if he is not in a position to answer now. I certainly do not want to push him into a corner. It is an important matter for companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just denied me the pleasure of giving him credit for something. I understand
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
that guidance notes were issued in 1974 and are still available. I was just about to say that, thanks to the hon. Gentleman's perspicacity, a number of problems have been solved—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Memory fades.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman obviously was not aware of what he had already achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal with the other question which the hon. Gentleman asked. The last paragraph of the explanatory memorandum explains the implications of the Bill:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Initially, a net increase of about nine staff will be needed to administer the provisions of the Bill, at a cost of £47,000 per year, falling after two years to about five staff at a cost of about £25,000 per year."</p></blockquote>
So we recognise that there will be a small increase. The hon. Gentleman knows the sums and the number of people involved. It is a relatively small increase and we are, in fact, looking at other ways of saving work and staff for the registry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to admit that the memory of the last point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) about special resolutions has slipped from my mind. I wonder whether he would care to remind me of his question. He explained to my hon. Friend why we needed a special resolution in certain cases, but then he was a little critical of the fact that we were too insistent on special resolutions in other instances. I am afraid that my note does not make as much sense to me as it did when I wrote it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that in the time left I should like to concentrate on another point, which I made earlier. My hon. Friend gave me such an encouraging comment about it that I should like to consolidate the position, so to speak. It concerns the required statutory declaration in subsection (3) of clause 5. I refer to the following subsection, subsection (4), which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The registrar may accept a declaration under subsection (3)(	<i>e</i>) above as sufficient evidence that the special resolution has been passed and the said conditions have been satisfied."</p></blockquote>
These are almost the same words as the direction to the registrar when a company is formed. This has been mentioned
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0067">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
this morning—clause 3(5). But in that case the registrar can be satisfied with a statutory declaration
	<br><blockquote><p>"by a solicitor engaged in the formation of a company, or by a person named as a director or secretary".</p></blockquote>
That is, one director, or the secretary or the solicitor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that it is perfectly logical to amend the 1948 Act and bring the provision relating to a private company becoming a public company in line with the provision when registering the company, and that the statutory declaration required should not be as it is at present in the 1948 Act but amended to go hand-in-hand with the declaration required on formation. Therefore, clause 5(3) should be so amended that instead of two directors we could have a director or the secretary making the declaration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the case made by my right hon. Friend is a strong one. I give him an assurance that we shall look into this matter. Personally, I hope that we shall be able to accom-
