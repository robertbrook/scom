	<p>CORRIGENDUM</p>
	<p>	<i>Official Report,</i> Standing Committee A, Sixth Sitting, 12 February 1980.</p>
	<p>In column 274, line 30, after "code", the following passage has been omitted from the speech of Mr. Mayhew:</p>
	<p>"of practice it is plainly right that he should have power to supersede, and if so advised, after consultation, he should have power to supersede a pre-existing code that may have been made by ACAS. To do that is to reflect the pre-eminence that the right hon. Gentleman's own 1975 Act afforded to the Secretary of State when considering whether to approve a code of practice
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>822</span>
previously issued by ACAS.</p>
	<p>It is only sensible that there be power for a subsequent code of practice to revise or supersede a preceding one. There may well be areas where there is overlapping but not a total supersession. It is only sensible to provide that each may supersede previous codes, from whatever source. Otherwise, there might well be the confusion that the right hon. Gentleman fears. The 1975 Act itself provided for the supersession of the previous 1972 code for a similar reason.</p>
	<p>The most significant reason of all for dissenting."</p>

	<div class='title'>DISMISSAL RELATING TO TRADE UNION MEMBERSHIP</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [28 February],</i> No. 116, in page 7, line 25, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"but provided that an employee holding any such objection pays or is prepared to pay to a registered charity the equivalent to contributions he would otherwise make to the appropriate union under a union membership agreement".—[	<i>Mr. Needham.</i>]</p></q></p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i>That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Needham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may remind the Committee of what happened last Thursday, my point in proposing this amendment was to make sure that a balance was established and maintained in the whole area of collective bargaining, particularly relating to the question of union membership agreements. As I said, many of us on the Government Benches feel that the balance has gone too far out in the last few years and it is time that it was redressed somewhat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, it seems to me that, when the Employment Bill becomes law, there is little point in giving hostages to fortune. We must try to ensure that the Bill works effectively, bearing in mind the point made about free riders. I mentioned what Donovan said on this matter, and we must all remember that what Donovan said has usually proved in the past to be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also said that I welcomed and accepted the views of my hon. and learned Friend on the question of the psychology that is required behind industrial relations legislation and the need to make sure that the atmosphere and temperature are kept low. I said that opponents of my amendment might object that it offered a method of requiring Danegeld, but that argument falls if the employee concerned accepts the benefits that come from bargaining by the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>824</span>
unions with the management. I pointed out, referring to Donovan, that that was accepted by those who, because of a religious conviction, said that they did not wish to be members of a union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point was whether such a provision could form part of a code of practice, particularly as there are many agreements which allow for conscience clauses and for opting out by those with conscientious objections. Could that now form part of a code of practice? As the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) said, an individual who had become an employee of a company might refuse to abide by the union membership agreement which stated that a conscientious objection was OK, but that the money should be paid to charity in lieu of the subscription. In those circumstances, there could be a conscientious objector failing to pay to a charity. This would make it difficult for the employer, who might well be abiding by the code of practice while the employee concerned would then rely on the primary legislation. One imagines that in those circumstances the primary legislation would prevail rather than the employer's reliance on the code of practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Third, it may, I suppose, be argued that very few people would be involved in my proposed arrangement. Equally, that could apply to those who have been unreasonably excluded or expelled. It is not a question of numbers here. Once again, it is a question of atmosphere. If the atmosphere is allowed to become soured because of somebody wanting to have the advantages of trade union membership without being prepared to pay for them, my feeling is that that will undermine much of what we are trying to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a persuasive argument here purely in industrial relations terms. Surely, it is better if someone who refuses to join a union pays a contribution to charity rather than going off and joining another or setting up one of his own with his colleagues. If somebody dislikes what a union has done, for conscientious reasons or reasons of deeply held personal conviction, it would be better for him to pay the equivalent subscription to a charity than to go off and try to get another union involved. This goes back to the arguments put by the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) about the number of unions that we have already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The corollary to that, I suppose, may be that the unions themselves may dislike
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0945">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>825</span>
the idea of allowing people to pay subscriptions to charity, on the basis that it might encourage many more people, who might not have consciences, to decide suddenly that they had. I am not convinced of that argument. I believe that in any event it is up to the union to show that it properly represents the views of its members. If it is not representing the views of its members and not doing a proper job, it can hardly be surprised if people decide to get out, for genuine reasons, and take their money elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, therefore, I think that it will benefit industrial relations to ensure that the trade union takes care in looking after its members' interests and has behind it the rather blunted threat—and rightly the lather blunted threat—of what will happen if it does not do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore I feel that the amendment has much to commend it. It strengthens the Bill rather than detracts from it, and I think that it is in line with good industrial relations practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Industrial Society, which has great expertise and experience in these affairs and has a large number of records of closed shop agreements—where they have taken place and how they operate—welcomes what I am suggesting and has said that it has the merit of making lawful what is known to be good practice and to work, and that this has been the thrust of the society's suggested legislation on such matters as health and safety, contracts of employment and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that my amendment falls within the broad grounds of industrial relations improvement, and I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) has a degree of interest in matters relating to industrial relations and of sympathetic experience in their practice that is the envy of many people in the House. He brings to the Committee a great deal of wisdom and experienced intelligence. But in this instance, I think, he has allowed his sympathy with what is undoubtedly in many cases good practice to outweigh his equal concern for principle. He is absolutely right that the difficulty in considering many disputed industrial relations issues is how to strike a balance between the rights of trade unions and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>826</span>
their obligations and the rights of employers and their obligations, and a balance between the rights of an individual and the need to recognise that unions have to have some privileged position under the law if they are to be able to achieve their prime purpose, which I have always thought to be the organising of their members so as to gain for them the advantages of collective rather than individual bargaining power. All these provide interlocking and overlapping conflicts of interest. The art or judgment—whatever one likes to call it—lies in knowing where and how to strike the balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise, too, with the argument about free riders. There is a great deal of resentment on the shop floor among those who subscribe to their trade unions and benefit from the negotiations that they carry out on their behalf. It is only human nature that there should be resentment that those advantages should be gained by people working alongside who do not contribute. That is rather trite and one need not take time over it, but it is at the root of what lies behind the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was also at the root of the proposal in the Industrial Relations Act 1971 which provided that in the case of an agency shop a contribution equivalent to the cost of the subscription to the trade union could be made to some other body. Interestingly, that did not meet with the approval of the TUC. I say "to some other body", the payment was there made on an agency basis to the unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The TUC said that to unions in Britain money is less important than commitment. That reaction must surely be reinforced if it is suggested that the money should be paid not even to them but to some charity. It said that the agency shop would create two classes of worker in a particular place—one party to and bound by the union's rules, and the other not party to and not bound by them. The proposal, it said, was therefore meant to weaken unions' authority. That comes from a TUC pamphlet called "Reason", on the I971 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend concluded his attractive argument by saying that if we did not go down his road we should be contributing to a worsening of industrial relations. To use his phrase, we should be souring the atmosphere and undoing much of what we are trying to achieve.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0946">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>827</span>
Yet from what it said in 1971 in the passage to which I have just referred, it looks as if the TUC would not welcome this addition to the Bill for the very reason there described. There would be two classes of employee working alongside, with the consequent souring of relationships, not withstanding that there was a payment to some charity. I hope that my hon. Friend will reflect upon that when he says, as he rightly does, that paramount to every provision of the Bill must be the question whether it furthers good industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that I thought that my hon. Friend had lost sight of an important point of principle. It is said that, because one will benefit from the negotiations of a trade union, one must be obliged to pay a sum equivalent to the subscription to the union even though one is not a member. That is the principle which is put forward. A man will benefit from what the union has achieved. He is not a member of the union. He has not asked it to work in a way which, in the event, will result in a benefit to him, but he must pay for it because it has done so and has benefited him as a kind of corollary or spin-off, from what it has been trying to do for those who do subscribe to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that that is a sound principle, and I do not believe that we ought to embody an unsound principle in statute law. It can be tested in this way. Let us suppose that there is a union of which a man is not a member and, instead of it achieving for him a benefit in the form of higher wages, he can show that it has inflicted upon him a disadvantage. Let us take a hypothetical case and suppose that it can be plainly established that the policy of the union has been so obscurantist, so Luddite, that it has insisted that there shall be so high a degree of over manning or of resistance to new technologies that his wages have actually been reduced below what they would be if the union had not—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Purely hypothetical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to advance this on what I believe to be a sensible basis. If the hon. Gentleman would listen and then criticise it, I should be grateful and it would help us all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that it can be shown that some union policies have actually resulted
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>828</span>
in lower wages for this man than he would have received from his employer otherwise. Is he entitled to be compensated by the union for what it has gratuitously cost him when he is not a member of that union? Of course he is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolute rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, as the hon. Member says, that is rubbish. Of course he is not. And why not? Those who advance this principle have to ask themselves that question. The reason is simple. A union is entitled to bargain on behalf of its members as it thinks fit, and any adverse effect that its bargaining may have on other people not its members is part of the luck of the game. Any adverse effect is something for which they cannot seek compensation from the union because it is for the employer to decide what to offer to each of his individual employees, and it is for each individual employee to decide what to accept by way of pay. That is the principle. Exactly the same is true where a union brings about a benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may be thought to be altogether too legalistic, which is a charge to which I am very sensitive, as the Committee knows. I am very sensitive to the flattery of being thought to be a good lawyer. I always try to disclaim it, and I generally do not have much difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is thought to be too legalistic, let us test the same principle outside the industrial relations context. If we do not all have to work for the same employer, let us take the hypothesis that we are all residents of a district served by the same local authority. We all have to pay the rates which are imposed by the local authority. Some of us belong to the ratepayers' association, others of us do not. The ratepayers' association runs an extremely successful campaign to lower the rates, supported, no doubt, by the Liberal candidate to the European Parliament. That campaign is crowned with success, and, lo and behold, our rates come down, along with everybody else's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it to be said that each of us ought to be obliged thereafter to pay to some charity a sum equal to the subscription that we should have to pay if we were members of the ratepayers' association?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh Lord!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0947">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>829</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It needs something rather more than cries of "Oh Lord", unless those cries are intended to reflect upon the argument advanced so attractively by my hon. Friend, because they are the same. They are on all fours in point of principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman explain why those arguments were not advanced when this principle was incorporated in the Industrial Relations Act 1971?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt, because I was not a Member of the House of Commons at that time. They may have been, for all I know. I have not read through every 	<i>Hansard.</i> Those who propose to support my hon. Friend's amendment must ask themselves why in those circustances we should not be compelled to pay a subscription either to the ratepayers' association or, indeed, to the Liberal Party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What it comes to is this—and this is my statement of principle. It is wrong to make people pay for what is theirs by right, namely here, the right to be left alone and not to be made to join a voluntary organisation or pay a subscription in lieu.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am fascinated by the hon. and learned Gentleman's argument in relation to the ratepayers' association supported by the Liberal candidate for the European Parliament. Will he recognise that he is confusing two issues? On the trade union side of the argument, which his hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) has advanced, benefits have been obtained from the employer on behalf of everyone, whereas in the case of the ratepayers' association, assisted by the Liberals, is it not a question of less being collected from everyone? The argument about contributing to the ratepayers' association does not hold up. The argue-ment of the local authority is simply that everyone should pay less rates—nothing to do with paying subscriptions to the ratepayers' association.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the principle is exactly the same. A benefit is conferred. But if the hon. Gentleman is worried by it I shall put it in a different way. The ratepayers' association gains much greater services for the whole community, me included, and that meets his point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>830</span>
pursue this interesting analogy with the local authority. Let us suppose that I move into a borough and I study what it is doing. I find that it is a Conservative-controlled borough, and I develop a deeply held personal conviction against the borough council. It offends all my conscientious feelings the way it is behaving over school meals, transport and everything else—and I decide that I want to opt out and I refuse to pay my rates to the council. That is really the parallel with not paying one's dues to the union. What would happen in those circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mathew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think the hon. Gentleman is on the right analogy at all. What we are discussing is whether, in a given context in which we all find ourselves placed, I have to pay a subscription in lieu of a subscription to a body to which I do not belong, which I have not invited to act for me, merely because that body—on behalf of those who have asked it to act for them on their behalf and to which they do belong—has achieved for them a benefit. That is wrong in principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I have asked my hon. Friend to reflect upon is this. First, I have invited him to consider whether he is and can be absolutely confident, in vew of what the TUC said in 1971, that his proposal will bring about better industrial relations, and even if he is, whether he can be sure that the principle is sustainable. If it is sustainable, why on earth should it not apply to existing employees?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, existing employees will not have to join a closed shop. Many UMAs provide for this, about two-thirds say that existing employees should not have to join, so long as they have not subsequently joined the union. Why should not an existing employee be made to join if this principle is so sound? I trust my hon. Friend would not go down that road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, this is good practice. Where the parties agree, I shall welcome a clause in a LIMA which provided for it. But I do not believe that it is right to make it compulsory. My hon. Friend referred to the Industrial Society and said that, apparently, that it has said much the same as he has said. I have deep respect for the Industrial Society. It has made an enormous contribution over the years to the understanding and practice of good Indus-rail relations. But, with the greatest respect, I suggest that it has got it wrong when it supports this amendment and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0948">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>831</span>
policy on the basis—I took my hon. Friend's words down—that it has the merit of making lawful what is good practice. Making lawful?—that is wrong. It is lawful already. Of course it is. What should have been said is "making compulsory", which is a very different matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore believe that it is questionable whether this proposal will contribute to good industrial relations. Where it can be voluntarily achieved, it is a very different matter. But it is questionable whether it will add to good industrial relations if it is made compulsory, and I cite the TUC in support of that, but it is in any event wrong in principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if my hon. Friend were confident—and I suggest that he cannot be—that it would further good industrial relations, I believe that in any event the point of principle ought to convince him that his amendment ought not to be pressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely acquit the hon. and learned Gentleman of any charge that his argument was legalistic. Although we use the term "legalistic" pejoratively a fact to which I would strongly object were I a lawyer, though it probably would not make much difference—nevertheless, an argument which is legalistic at least has some substance, and the hon. and learned Gentleman's argument had no substance at all. It was not legalistic. It was so airy-fairy and imaginative, so unreal, so out of this world and so divorced from what goes on in industry as to be completely fantastic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not matter that the chap concerned has not—to quote the hon. and learned Gentleman's words—"invited the union to act for him". It does not matter whether he has or has not. What matters is whether he takes the benefits which the union has achieved. In my experience I have found in industry that the chaps who have conscientious objections to paying union subscriptions have no conscientious objections to taking the wage increases that the unions negotiate. I have known a few places where they were the first in the queue with not one but both hands held out for the wage increase. The question whether the chap's benefit comes by invitation to the union to act for him is absolutely irrelevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon and learned Gentleman quoted the TUC as saying that commitment and involvement mean much more than money.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>832</span>
No one could dispute that. But he was presenting that to his hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) as an 	<i>obiter dictum</i> and saying that he should not press his amendment because it was contrary to the views of the TUC on industrial relations and trade union matters. I am prepared to go along with the hon. and learned Gentleman if, in return, he will apply the wisdom of the TUC to the Bill and if he will accept all its views about it. He cannot be selective about which of the views of the TUC he commends and which he rejects. He has rejected virtually everything that the TUC has said about the Bill, and he does not carry much conviction when commending to his hon. Friend one particular view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But even though it is a fact that commitment is more important than money, that is not to say that money is not important. It has a role to play. Nobody looks upon the hon. Gentleman's proposal as offering the best of all possible worlds. As he suggested with characteristic modesty, it is a fall-back, a 	<i>pis allers.</i> That is all that it is intended to be. To that extent it is quite useful. It is not earth-shattering. It will not cause any great revolution. It will not make a huge difference. In some circumstances, in some places of employment, in some shops, it could result in avoiding what might otherwise be a rumpus. That is the real answer to the silly bit of the hon. and learned Gentleman's speech about the ratepayers' association. If that is all he can dream up, it is pretty poor as an answer to his hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In principle, I suppose, the hon. and learned Gentleman is right, but there is one substantial difference. What we all seek is peace in industry. We seek to avoid conflict. When we bend our minds to the clauses and subsections in the Bill and to the amendments, we should do so against the criterion of whether we are making a contribution to industrial peace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

The plain fact is that the free rider is the cause of industrial friction over and over again. I have not yet heard of a riot in a village caused by the fact that some choose not to pay a due to the ratepayers' association. I have not heard of any stoppages of work or public services, or of any other conflict or social unrest arising from whether people choose to belong to a ratepayers' association.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

When the day comes when blood is flowing in the streets of High Wycombe over a failure to pay a due to the ratepayers' association, I shall give some consideration to the problem to which the hon. Gentleman refers. But we are talking about real life, for goodness' sake. We are not talking about fairy tales and fantasies. In real life what I have stated is a fact. We may deplore it—or some people may deplore it—but it happens to be a fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chippenham quoted the Industrial Society, and the hon. and learned Gentleman paid tribute to it. I add my tribute. It has done a good job. Ask the Industrial Society whether there have been or arc circumstances in which the free rider is a cause of industrial unrest, and it answers "Yes, of course" That is known to the society just as it is known to anyone who has ever worked in industry. The ratepayers' association free rider is not a cause of any unrest, never has been and is never likely to be. That is the answer to the hon. Gentleman's intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the most phantasmagoria part of all the phantasmagorical parts of the hon. and learned Gentleman's argument was his suggestion that trade unions negotiated in order to reduce the wages of their members. That is a great idea. Why should the free rider have to pay to charity as an equivalent to paying into a trade union which negotiates in order to reduce his wages?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not in order to reduce them. I did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or having that effect. I concede at once that there is the odd marginal occasion on which that could happen. But it is very rare and is in any case always temporary. If there were any significant incidence of trade union negotiations resulting in a lowering of workers' standards, we should all be free riders. None of the union members would pay their subscriptions. Union members have been known to withhold subscriptions on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>834</span>
more than one occasion when they have disagreed with action taken on their behalf or negotiations carried out by their officials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is getting away from real life altogether. It is inventing a different planet with different industry and different people from those in real life on this planet. If the hon. and learned Gentleman cannot do better than that, he ought to throw a bone to his hon. Friend and let him have his way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) has demolished the very weak case put up by the hon. and learned Gentleman. If anyone wishes to demolish my case before I start, I shall be only too happy to give way, but I think it important to recognise that subsection (2) which the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) seeks to amend is, as at present drafted—unless it is altered by the Government at some stage—a recipe for disaster where the real work of industry goes on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State and the hon. and learned Gentleman know full well that it is impossible to define what the term "deeply-held personal conviction" means. It is an invitation to every free rider in the country to jump on the bandwagon to save the few shillings a week that his union contribution would cost him while at the same time enjoying the benefits that trade union membership confers not only on him but also on his family. This is the context in which the amendment has to be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By his amendment, the hon. Member for Chippenham is trying to put some justice back into what is a nonsensical subsection. He made the point that if people allege that they hold deeply-held personal convictions and do not wish to belong to a trade union, at least they should show that they have some sort of conviction by making an equivalent contribution to a registered charity. Nobody would for a moment suggest that that is a perfect solution. But an impossible situation is being created by the Secretary of State in this ridiculous, with its nonsensical subsection (2). The hon. Gentleman has at least addressed himself to that and sought to put some equity back into this aspect of industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary has rejected his hon. Friend's argument without facing the serious problems that have been created. I have no doubt that those who fall within
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0950">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>835</span>
the ambit of "grounds of conscience", particularly those who have deeply-held religious beliefs, will have no difficulty—and have never had any difficulty—in coming to terms with this problem. We all know of one sect, the Jehovah's Witnesses, with whom many shop stewards and convenors have had to deal over many years. There have never been any problems. We have always managed to accommodate members of that sect. We have said to them "We accept your strongly held religious beliefs". We often wondered why they held them, but that was their decision. We asked them to pay a contribution and they willingly did so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Almost invariably, people join that faith later in life; there is no question of their being brought up in it from childhood. It is their road to Damascus—they see the light—they join that faith. Often, they have been members of trade unions in closed shop situations, and they simply turn up to work one morning and explain to the shop steward or convenor that they have now joined the Jehovah's Witnesses which lays down certain strict rules about participation with other groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all my years of experience in the trade union movement, I cannot recall ever experiencing or reading about a dispute, a strike or a stoppage created by an individual joining the Jehovah's Witnesses and thereby creating union problems, and that has been so because these people recognise that the way round the dilemma is, in effect, to do what the hon. Gentleman's amendment seeks to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary has not faced up to the issue. Will it mean that if this little answer put forward by his hon. Friend is not accepted by the Government, the trade unions will have to take alternative action? It may not necessarily be industrial action. It may at this stage be a rethink by 'branches of trade unions and by unions in certain situations or factories where they will have to look again at what they could do. One of the things that they could do is say that they will withdraw the benefits of trade union membership from those who are not members of the union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members always assume that that refers simply to wages. I have news for them. It does not. There is a host of other issues involved in trade union membership. For instance, the vast majority of trade unions have negotiated agreements with their
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>836</span>
employers that there shall be such things as canteens on the premises and that those canteens shall offer a subsidised nourishing meal to the employees. Would it be in order for the trade unions in such an establishment to say that those who are not members of the union shall not enjoy the benefits of the canteen 'but must go elsewhere?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may sound a little far-fetched, but if the trade unions are to be put in that position, it would be hardly surprising if they reacted by looking at all the benefits which are conferred upon members. There are such things as toilet provision. It may surprise hon. Members to know that when I started working in the shipbuilding industry the toilet provision in the shipyards was appalling. For the benefit of the hon. and learned Gentleman, let me say that the toilets consisted of one long stone trough down which water flushed at intervals, with partitions dividing it into spaces without doors of any kind. Indeed, one of the tricks of the apprentices was to get a piece of oily waste, take it to the end compartment, light it and send it down on the next flush of water. It was the arguments and pressure of the trade unions in the shipbuilding industry which resulted in reasonable toilet accommodation being provided. That is not wages but conditions. This is often overlooked by hon. Gentlemen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there are such things as safety measures, safety clothing, footwear, gloves, goggles, earmuffs. We have all those not because of some 'benevolent employer suddenly decoding that he had better start thinking about this employees' welfare but because of the activities of the trade unions, which often had to force out of the employers what any rational employer would have recognised as provision which should be made without any argument. But long and bitter struggles took place over the provision of these things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I take an illustration from the industry which I know best, the shipbuilding industry. I can recall many occasions when to get a pair of industrial gloves out of the employer to protect one's hands when using such things as a grinder almost took a strike. Now they are standard provision, because the trade unions have established that it is right to protect the workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the free loader can simply say that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0951">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>837</span>
he has a conscience which has now decided that he should not pay his subscriptions, why should the unions not react against it? Why should all the benefits for which they have fought for many years still be bestowed upon this guy? Never mind the wages or bonuses which could also be the subject of another argument—let us think about the conditions which have been created by joint action in the form of trade unionism for the workers in an establishment. Are we to say that people can carry on enjoying all those benefits and keep their money in their pockets while the rest of us are contributing?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the Secretary of State or the Under-Secretary have thought through the ramifications which flow from the clause that they have presented. I suggest to them that, far from attacking their hon. Friend's arguments, they should be thanking him for at least attempting to put forward something which may have a helpful effect on the situation which they are creating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow said, to use the argument that the TUC has put forward countervailing arguments in relation to the 1971 situation means that the Under-Secretary is bereft of any arguments whatsoever. He knows that from now on, every time we come to an argument on future clauses, we shall quote the TUC's opposition to what is proposed by the Government, and, in view of his argument on this amendment by his hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham, we shall ask whether he will adopt the same criterion and whether, because the TUC has pointed out reasoned objections showing why that clause or subsection will not work, he will withdraw it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman has at least had the common sense to realise that his hon. Friend has stirred up a hornets' nest. I suggest that he should think again and accept his hon. Friend's argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric G. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) moved his amendment sincerely. He obviously believes in it, and I hope that he will not necessarily be persuaded by the reply that he has
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>838</span>
received so far from the Under-Secretary. The amendment is a serious attempt to deal with the free rider problem and, while we on this side do not like the clause one little bit and think that it is a recipe for trouble-making and nit-picking, we think that the hon. Gentleman's amendment deserves support on two grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the Government have decided to widen the conscience provision in clause 6, moving away from the narrow ground of religious belief, which is always dealt with seriously and adequately by the trade union movement, to grounds of conscience and other deeply held personal conviction. As hon. Friends have demonstrated on more than one occasion, this will be extremely difficult to interpret. I remember particularly the speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther), which was a powerful exposition of how he thought that people would try to use these grounds of conscience and deeply held personal conviction to get round the membership of a trade union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason is that we shall come later in the clause to the provision or ballots and the onerous conditions attached to those ballots. So the hon. Member for Chippenham has done the Committee a service by trying to reduce the area of friction that will occur, and his proposal deserves serious consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary's reply was extremely bizarre in the way that he tried to pay the hon. Gentleman some tribute but then proceeded to thump him on the head and lecture him about how the TUC would be opposed to all this. It is an extraordinary argument to use in this Committee. He said that the TUC was opposed to the amendment—I bet that he has not asked the TUC whether it is opposed to it—and he had to jog back to 1971 to get his justification. Obviously, the midnight oil has been burnt in the Department of Employment in an effort to rustle up some decent arguments to persuade his hon. Friend to withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we shall be have the hon. and learned Gentleman's support when we advance arguments that have been put forward by the TUC against other provisions of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that most of them are extremely good. Some of the hon. and learned Gentleman's arguments went into realms of fantasy. For one moment, I suspected that he had been present at that seminar that was given by Professor Milton Friedman in Downing Street the other day, so unrealistic were his arguments. He tried to persuade his hon. Friend not to 'persist with the amendment on the basis of asking why people should pay for something which is their right, that is, by contributing to a charity. My hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) has just demonstrated that that does not apply. One can envisage that in certain situations a trade union may make a foolish wage bargain or something of that kind which in the short term way result in its members being worse off—one can understand that and perhaps draw on some evidence—but other factors must be taken into consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most trade unions do not exist only to negotiate wages. They exist also to negotiate conditions, holiday pay and so on. My hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) spoke of clothing and other welfare provision. I know of several instances where that is the case and the free rider would be the first to benefit from such provisions. I take an illustration from the National Union of Mineworkers, an organisation of which I have some knowledge. The pneumoconiosis provisions which were established only a few years ago were set up initially with a grant of £100 million from the Treasury so that a scheme could be brought in so that 35,000 either serving mine workers or ex-mine workers could receive compensation rather than be dragged through the courts to receive it through common law. Everyone in the industry now benefits from that provision, and it was a negotiated arrangement between the union and the National Coal Board. There has been provision of safety equipment and safety clothing as a result of collective agreement and negotiation. Of course, the free riders would benefit from that. My right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mi. Walker) had something
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>840</span>
to do with the provision of compensation for people in slate quarries. That was not wages but compensation negotiated with the trade unions concerned. It is not merely a question of employees being required to pay for something which is their right. So while we do not like this clause, we think that the free rider problem could be mitigated by the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an onerous provision regarding ballots contained in the new section 58A:
	<br><q><p>"A union membership agreement shall"</p></q>
only come into existence if
	<br><q><p>"80 per cent. of those entitled to vote in the ballot voted in favour of the agreement's application."</p></q>
I hope that there will be drastic revision of this and that some of our relevant amendments will find favour when we reach them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government do not alter those provisions, I can envisage many disputes arising where perhaps 75 per cent. of all employees vote for a membership agreement and fail by I per cent. Then the free rider problem will become of paramount 'importance and many disputes will take place as a result. Seventy-five per cent. of the work force will go about the workplace saying "Yes, we voted in favour of the closed shop, and now we have something like 2I per cent. of the employees enjoying the conditions, not only the wages but the welfare provisions which have been negotiated." That is a recipe for discontent. For all those reasons, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not 'be persuaded by the words of the Under-Secretary, and, if he does persist with his amendment, I am sure he will find some support on this side of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I have only two sentences or so to express my sympathy and commiseration with the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham)? We all heard his extremely persuasive and helpful speech, which arose from his experience of industry, in which he sought to soften and humanise this provision. He knows that there is resentment of the free loader who says "I have deep religious, moral, ethical or conscientious feelings," and someone else says "That's toffee—it is just an excuse for not paying your money." If, however, the person says "I shall prove how
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0953">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>841</span>
deep my conscientious feelings are by making a contribution to charity, the hon. Gentleman argues that that will be helpful—to use the Under-Secretary's word—in a psychological way. But for his pains, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) said, the hon. Gentleman got thumped on the head. He has thus come up against the rigid inflexible ideological approach of the Government, and I sympathise with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, it was all dressed up with the circumlocution of which the Under-Secretary is capable, but that is exactly what the hon. Gentleman has come up against. Presumably, if the amendment had gone through, the hawks would have been most upset. I do not know what hawks do. I suppose that they squawk. They would all squawk furiously and he would be described as a wet individual. It must Abe educative for him, with his industrial experience, to put forward a sensible view, backed up by Industrial Society's educated opinion, only to be thumped on the head by an ideological Government. I commiserate with him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was sorry that my hon. Friend confined himself to so few short sentences. He may not be aware that at a lunch yesterday the Secretary of State singled him out for special commendation, suggesting that people might come along to the Committee to listen particularly to my hon. Friend's expertise. People may have flooded into the Committee this morning just to hear him. So I hope that he will not confine himself to two sentences too often.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall bear that in mind when I make my next contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I detain the Committee for a few moments more and offer some reassurance to my hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham)? The last thing I wanted to do was to thump him on the head. I have far too much respect for its contents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may help my hon. Friend if I give him an assurance that the code of practice which my right hon. Friend, after consultation with ACAS, proposes to issue on the implementation of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>842</span>
closed shop will refer to and give practical advice on payment to a charity as a voluntary alternative to union membership in a closed shop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is code of practice material rather than main legislation material, if only because, apart from the points of principle to which I shall not revert, great complexity would be necessitated in the main legislation. For example, it would have to deal with the question whether all conscientious objectors should be obliged to pay, what the appropriate level of payments would be, what charity would be approved, how to deal with disputes as to whether payment had been made and so on. I hope, therefore, that it will help him if I give my hon. Friend the assurance that practical advice will be given in the code of practice which my right hon. Friend proposes to issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) will make his own decision on how he will proceed in these matters. He is a very intelligent member of the Committee and he will understand exactly what has just been suggested by his hon. and learned Friend. I warn him, lest it has escaped his attention, that what his hon. and learned Friend is suggesting is that he withdraws the amendment and leaves it entirely to the Government to incorporate something in a code of practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The codes of practice, when they come forward, will be whisked through the House on the basis of an hour and a half's debate, and the hon. Gentleman may not even be called to speak on the code of practice dealing with this matter. Above all, we cannot amend a code of practice when it comes before the House. We moved an amendment that codes of practice should be amendable, but he will recall that that was voted down by the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman is serious about dealing with the free rider problem—which, as I think he recognises, will grow worse as a result of the Bill—he should decide that he wants his amendment written into the legislation and not left to the procedures of code of practice. He will have no chance to amend them, and he may have no chance to speak to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Needham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I reply briefly to the two points raised by my hon. and learned Friend? First, he suggested that, because the TUC had not found much to favour in the agency shop arrangements, my proposal might not be of such benefit to industrial relations as I thought it to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many occasions on which I believe the TUC to be out of touch. Unlike the Opposition, I feel under no constraint to accept the views of the TUC on whether industrial relations will be improved. I suspect that the TUC's recent views on the question of ballots are not views with which I have any sympathy. Therefore, what the TUC said or did not say cannot influence me very greatly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, my hon. and learned Friend asked me to consider the question of principle. Principle seems to be a subject much better understood by hon. and right hon. Members on the Opposition Benches than by those of us in the Conservative Party. Principle is something of which Conservatives have to be careful, and quite rightly so, but our views are naturally based upon the practicalities of life rather than upon some airy-fairy view about society as people might want it to be as opposed to society as it is. Therefore, in looking at these matters, I am not unduly swayed by arguments of principle either,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

the courage of their convictions and more who will remember about principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The underlying purpose of these amendments is to challenge the need which is expressed in this Bill to enshrine in law the rights of existing non-unionists to remain non-unionists in cases where a union membership agreement is introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3B) covers those who are employed and who were non-members prior to an existing union membership agreement or union membership agreement concluded between now and the time the Act comes into force and, for whatever reason, were not required to join the union. Under this subsection, employees in this new protected category will not have to put forward any reason for not being union members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Technically, there are difficulties with this clause, particularly as it relates to subsection (3C). It seems as if subsection (3B)(	<i>b</i>) applies to all union memberships, including new ones, and not just existing ones. Under subsection (3C)(	<i>b</i>) the non-member has to be a non-member since the date of the ballot, but under subsection (3B)(	<i>b</i>) he need only be a non-member since the date the UMA had effect, which could be much later. So there is some confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second and more substantial point is that, as subsection (3B) stands, a trouble maker can resign the day before a UMA comes into effect and still qualify for exemption. It is an absurd position. At least he should be made to prove his bona fides by showing that he was not in a union for three months before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another problem about subsection (3B)(	<i>b</i>). Is it concerned solely with existing non-unionists, or is it also giving rights to somebody who is a member of a trade union but not the trade union covered by the union membership agreement? We need to know that. If it is the latter as well, this could unnecessarily encourage multi-unionism and lead to inter-union disputes. Of course there are these kinds of cases. It is a fairly common problem in industry, given the structure of the British trade union movement. The Opposition feel however that it is far better to leave these cases to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>846</span>
operation of the Bridlington agreement than to enshrine the rights of trade unionists who are not covered by the UMA in law as we think this clause probably does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our objection is much broader. It is an objection in principle. We are not objecting just on technical grounds. We object, in principle, to the approach contained in this Bill, because we believe that if it is appropriate—as it often is—to make exemptions for existing non-unionists, it is far better to do this through voluntary agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here I quote the Department of Employment's own survey, carried out for them by John Gennard, Stephen Dunn and Michael Wright of the Industrial Relations Department of the LSE. The interesting feature of this survey is that it shows that there has been not only a great expansion of closed shop agreements, but also a growing sophistication and a clarity of agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These agreements have a carefully worked out procedure for resolving problems. They also—and this is germane to the amendment—make provision for exemptions. I think the hon. and learned Gentleman has already quoted this point, so he knows about it. He cannot say he does not know that almost two-thirds of the UMAs covered by the LSE survey make allowances for existing non-unionists. The one-third which do not still retain a wide range of exemptions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So our argument is that already the practice is flexible. It already takes care of existing non-unionists, and we say that what needs to happen now is for this practice—and also the TUC guidance on closed shops—to be observed by all trade unions making closed shop agreements. It may well be that this could be backed up by a code of practice, but we think the flexible, sophisticated voluntary approach is the best way to deal with this problem of existing non-unionists. It is wrong, we feel, to get into the rigid legal framework into which the clause is trying to put this problem. That raises new difficulties which the voluntary approach avoids by leaving matters to employers and trade unionists to sort out, which we think is much the better way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, we believe that the closed shop is good for the vast majority
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0956">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>847</span>
of employers, and I am glad that the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) agrees with us there. We believe that it suits most employees. Of course we need to concern ourselves with the rights of minorities. The trouble with the Government's approach is that they are so concerned with the rights of the minorities that they are in danger of undermining the rights of the majority. We think that our approach is preferable; it preserves the rights of the majority while at the same time making allowance for the difficulties that arise from minority views, through the voluntary approach, the TUC code and perhaps also through a code of practice. We think our approach is the better one, and therefore I would ask the Committee to support our amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the way in which the hon. Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Radice) moved the amendment. I quite agree with his last observation that there is a danger that one can get so obsessed with the rights of individuals as to achieve an unbalanced result, and to work against what reality suggests ought to be the rights of the majority. We must always be careful about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might help if I briefly reminded the Committee of the effect of this group of amendments. Amendment No. 83 limits the protection against unfair dismissal given in new subsection (3B) in clause 6(2) to existing employees who have not at any time since the closed shop agreement has been in operation been members of a trade union in accordance with the agreement, and to those employees who have not at any time since three months before the agreement came into operation been members of a trade union in accordance with the agreement. The result is that employees cannot leave a specified union within a period three months before the agreement comes into operation and go on to gain the protection against unfair dismissal given to existing employees in new subsection (3B).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 84 removes in its entirety new subsection (3B) which gives protection against unfair dismissal to existing employees who have not at any time been trade union members in accordance with the agreement. Amendment No. 85 limits the protection against
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>848</span>
unfair dismissal available to existing employees who have not at any time since the agreement took effect been trade union members in accordance with the agreement. It limits that protection to an employee who since the agreement took effect has not been a member of any trade union whatsoever and does not propose to join any trade union other than a trade union specified in accordance with the agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one takes amendment No. 83 in conjunction with No. 85, that would have the effect regarding existing employees that a dismissal in a closed shop would be regarded as unfair only if the employee had not at any time since a date three months before the agreement took effect been a member of any trade union whatsoever and did not propose to join any trade union other than the one specified in the agreement. That is the effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe I only have to recite that effect to make it plain that the Government cannot accept the amendments, and the starting point for our argument is that if one is an existing employee already on the payroll, a closed shop agreement which is made constitutes a major change in the terms and conditions on which one is working. It is a change which effects a major inroad into one's personal liberty. The most well publicised of recent cases is the British Rail one which has now gone to Strasbourg. It is a major change in the rules under which the employee took on his work and under which his employment was engaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill therefore proposes that it shall be unfair—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>THE CHAIRMAN'S 	<i>attention having been called to the fact that eight Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room and eight Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying, Mr. Lead-bitter, that the proposal in the Bill is that it shall be unfair to dismiss somebody who is already on the payroll for not joining the union once the UMA is made and who for whatever reason has declined to join, provided that at no
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0957">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>849</span>
time since the agreement was made has he been a member. That is how the Bill deals with this major inroad which is made into one's personal liberty by having a closed shop agreement made after one has taken on employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This goes no further than to make statutory what a large number of closed shop agreements already embody. The hon. Gentleman has referred to the survey by Mr. Gennard, Mr. Dunn and Mr. Wright commissioned by the Department and published in November last year in the 	<i>Department of Employment Gazette.</i> There were 136 UMAs covering a total of 1.7 million workers, about one-third of the total closed shop population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With new agreements, it is usual now to exclude existing non-union employees. This is the argument against amendment No. 84 which would limit protection to existing employees to those with conscientious objections alone. We do not believe that that can be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 83 says that if one is to claim this protection, one must not have belonged to a union for at least three months. My first point on this is that it is important to preserve the right to leave a union when the member wishes, when he makes up his mind to do so. That liberty should be preserved. If a large number of people left a trade union when they got wind of a closed shop agreement being in the offing that would surely suggest lack of support for the closed shop agreement itself and that the union was perhaps out of touch with its members' feelings. But, in practice, there will not be large numbers doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In current closed shops, the number will be very small indeed because so few are permitted to stay in employment if they are not members of the union where a closed shop agreement is in force. A high proportion of the rest will he disinterested. If they were so keen on joining another union, why not join it in the first place? In future closed shops, 80 per cent. will have had to have voted "Yes" in any event for the closed shop to have been validated and for the employer to be confident that he will not have to pay compensation for unfair dismissal if subsequently he dismisses an employee for not joining the union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point is an important point
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>850</span>
of principle. A worker may very well be content to 'be a voluntary member of a trade union knowing that he can leave without peril to his job but jib at the prospect of being a compulsory member by virtue of a closed shop agreement. He may value, for example, his freedom to express his disapproval of union policy by leaving the union at will. So, when he learns that a closed shop agreement is in the offing, he may wish to resign. He will not be entitled to protection under the clause if he is told "No, you have resigned within the three months" That is yet another serious objection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth joint is that anxiety about allowing people to leave a specified union and to organise another union in rivalry with it is greatly exaggerated. To dismiss someone now on this ground alone is already unfair under section 58(1) of the 1978 Consolidation Act. One cannot dismiss someone on the ground alone of his activities in union organisation. It must be unfair to deprive of compensation an existing employee simply on the ground that he might organise another union. Yet the hon. Gentleman has put great stress on this fear in support of his amendment. The 	<i>Gazette</i>research shows that this is an exaggerated fear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to amendment No. 85. Just as it is right to entitle someone to conscientious objection to a particular union, so post-UMA membership of a union as a disentitlement to unfair dismissal compensation ought to be limited to the specified union. The same argument applies to the second limb of amendment No. 85. The first limb would mean that an individual who had joined a union before a closed shop agreement took effect, which was not a union then specified in the agreement, would not have the protection against unfair dismissal available to other existing employees who were not members of the specified union or any other. An existing employee who voluntarily joined a union before a closed shop was established should not be forced by 'the change in his terms and conditions of employment to join another union to which he might object by the threat of losing his job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the justification for the two questions which the hon. Gentleman asked. The first was whether a troublemaker could be in the union until the day that the agreement took effect and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0958">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>851</span>
then claim exemption. The answer is "Yes", but that is the justification for it. The second question was whether subsection (3B) applied to someone who, though not a member of the specified union, was a member of a rival union. The answer is "Yes". He loses his protection only if he has joined the specified union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second limb of amendment No. 85 would remove the protection against unfair dismissal available to existing employees in the new subsection (3B) from those employees if they proposed to join a union other than a specified union once the agreement was effected. The amendment reflects the hon. Gentleman's concern, but that concern is exaggerated, and I think that I have adequately set out the reasons why we believe that exaggeration to exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore we believe that, if it is right to protect existing employees from the consequences of a closed shop agreement and to give them the protection which entitlement to compensation for unfair dismissal provides, that protection should not, nor could it justly be, restricted to anything like the extent provided for in the amendments. I must therefore advise my right hon. and hon. Friends to resist them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman has not quietened my fears about the problems that might arise from the clause. He has confirmed them in all that he has said.

	<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman has confirmed that the clause could legally and officially encourage multi-unionism which I am assured the hon. and learned Gentleman often says that he is against.

We think that it is far better to leave it to the good sense of trade unions and to the TUC guidance, that the effect of the clause will be to achieve something which the hon. and learned Gentleman says that he does not wish to achieve—an unbalanced result—and that he has enshrined in law the rights of minorities at the expense of the majorities.

	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The arguments on these two amendments are not dissimilar from some that my hon. Friend the Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Radice) deployed on the previous set of amendments, particularly on amendment No. 85. So it may well be that the Under-Secretary will suggest that our anxieties are exaggerated in respect of these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3C)(	<i>b</i>) refers only to membership of a trade union
	<br><q><p>"in accordance with the agreement"</p></q>
So it seems from that that an employee could presumably be a member of another union outside the agreement and not recognised by the employer. That appears to be the case. If that is the kind of exemptions that exists, it appears to us to encourage multi-unionism and, potentially, inter-union disputes and fragmentation generally of a kind that I thought the Committee sought to avoid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think that an employee in these circumstances really ought to show that he objects to joining by actually showing that he is a non-unionist and by proving after the ballot that he does not intend to join some rival union. I do not think that that would place any undue burden on an individual. Assurances could be given that would quite reasonably cover that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these circumstances, the presence of someone who joined another union might even let a union get a toehold into a plant or factory where it had no real rights or had not been active before. It might be a union not affiliated to the TUC, and one can imagine the difficulties that that would cause if the main union was TUC-affiliated. It might simply be someone who was a malcontent. Whatever the reason, we think that it could do considerable damage to industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The TUC in its advice says in a paragraph headed "Exclusive Agreements":
	<br><q><p>"A particular problem which has occurred in recent years has been the conclusion of exclusive union membership agreements by one union in circumstances where another affiliated union or unions has had a membership interest. On occasions such action may breach the 'TUC Disputes Principles and Procedures'. More generally it can generate and endanger good inter-union relations. When
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>854</span>
making union membership agreements or arrangements unions should have regard to interests of other unions, who may be affected and should consider their position in the drafting of the agreement"</p></q>
That is very sensible advice followed generally by trade unions and by sensible employers. Yet, having followed that kind of advice, some maverick, somebody with a chip on his shoulder, perhaps actually aided and abetted by a maverick-type or breakaway union, can cause a great deal of difficulty and trouble and, by doing so, can undermine to some extent the results of a ballot in favour of a union membership agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary may say, rather as he did on the previous batch of amendments, that he does not see anything of that kind happening on any real scale and that these fears are exaggerated. But it is up to him in this situation to prove the need for what the Government presumably see as a safeguard but what we certainly see as unnecessary and potentially harmful. So our view is that it would be far better if this subsection were scrapped and, if not, that it was suitably amended in the way that we have suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are taking these two amendments together. Perhaps it might help if I reminded the Committee of the effect of each.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 86 removes, subsection (3C)(	<i>b</i>). The effect of this would be that existing employees who were members of the union after the closed shop agreement took effect but who left before a validating ballot was taken would not be protected against unfair dismissal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 87 is more limited and has the effect that those employees who qualify as existing employees following a closed shop ballot shall preserve their protection against dismissal only if they do not join, or propose to join, any trade union whatsoever, whether or not named in the agreement. I think it is to that that the hon. Gentleman has exclusively addressed his observations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I think that I ought to deal briefly with amendment No. 86. That amendment is unacceptable because it seeks to enforce a decision in favour of a closed shop expressed in a ballot on the rest of the existing work force other than
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0960">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>855</span>
those who have conscientious objection to union membership and who are protected by earlier provisions in the Bill. In those circumstances, there would be this difficulty. The removal of this subsection, effected by amendment No. 86, would not remove the protection from unfair dismissal from the actual employees concerned. There would anyway be existing employees who had not at any time while the agreement was in effect been union members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is still the possibility that a UMA is announced and takes effect before there is a ballot on its approval. In these circumstances, an existing but voluntary trade union member ought, the Government believe, to have the chance to decide whether to stay a member or leave until the ballot which will confirm the UMA. The new subsection (3)(	<i>b</i>) which amendment No. 86 would remove is consistent with the objective of the ballot provision, which is that those to be affected should not lose protection without having a chance to approve or disapprove the agreement. It also prevents what might otherwise be a way of limiting the general protection given to existing employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of amendment No. 87 is to require the employee not to join a subsequent union or to propose to join another trade union. The employee has to say that he does not propose to join any trade union whatsoever, other than a trade union specified in accordance with the agreement. The hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) is absolutely right when he says that the arguments are much the same as those applying to amendment No. 85, with which we have just dealt. I think that the reassurance to the anxieties expressed is contained in the Bridlington procedures to a great extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that somebody says "Very well, I am coming out of the union" or "I don't propose to join the union, nor will I say that I am not going to join any other union, and I probably will join another union" Is that likely to happen? If it does happen, the employee may very well, I suggest, find that his application to join another union is rejected. He might find that the employer would not continue to keep him in employment but would dismiss him, and in those circumstances, if there was a clear breach of the Bridling-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>856</span>
ton procedures, the employer's dismissal might very well be regarded as reasonable and fair. Certainly if the employee was refused admission into the new union and that union was not a specified union under the closed shop agreement, it is unlikely, I would guess, that he would be able to use the procedures of clause 3(5) and say that he had been unreasonably excluded, if there had been a breach of Bridlington.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we believe it to be right that the freedom not to have to join a particular union—of which the employee may for one reason or another disapprove—ought to be preserved, and we believe that there is no significant risk of the encouragement of inter-union rivalry, which formed the substance of the argument put forward by the hon. Member for Islington, Central in support of these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the Opposition's fears are exaggerated. I quite agree that we would not wish to encourage inter-union rivalry in any significant way, but we believe that the case in favour of these amendments has not been made out and I must advise my right hon. and hon. Friends to resist them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can appreciate the Under-Secretary's argument on amendment No. 86, but I want to return to No. 87 because his response was utterly unconvincing. We have tried on a number of occasions to persuade the Under-Secretary and the Government to build the Bridlington agreements into the Bill in some way, and the furthest he would go at any stage was to say that they would be taken account of, he thought, in the codes. It was a fairly vague assurance that we had got somewhere in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now the hon. and learned Gentleman tells us that in these circumstances, if an employer dismissed a man for joining a union other than the one specified in the agreement and he took his case to the tribunal, the tribunal would, he thinks, throw it out if there were a breach of Bridlington. I do not understand on what basis he is saying that, or what the evidence is for it. That is pure theory. Where does he conjure it from? He seems to have plucked that one out of thin air to support his argument on the amendment without any evidence that it will be taken account. Indeed,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0961">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>857</span>
throughout the Committee when we have sought to illustrate the degree to which the Bridlington agreements are being undermined in clause after clause, he has rejected our argument. I find it very strange.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the outset, the hon. and learned Gentleman talked about somebody joining another union and probably having his application rejected. The point I made in my opening remarks was that the kind of union that that individual would deliberately set out to join in these circumstances might well be a union not affiliated to the TUC—probably a breakaway union, quite possibly a union that was contesting membership rights and trying to get a toehold.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both these are technical amendments to remedy an anomaly in subsection (3D) as originally drafted. Their effect is to ensure that where there are changes in the employer such that existing employees maintain continuity of employment, a ballot or fresh ballot of employees is not required. The amendment makes this clear. The Bill as drafted did not—this was the legal advice—cover the new employer in relation to employees taken on after the change in employer but only in relation</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>If we are talking about a malcontent, that might well be the sort of union he would choose to join and, rather than his application being rejected, in those circumstances it would be much more likely to be accepted.</p>
	<p>I find the Under-Secretary's argument, particularly on the second amendment, thoroughly unconvincing and, on the evidence of what he has said, I think that this is an amendment on which we ought to divide the Committee.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 10, Noes 13.</p>
	<p>to those in employment at the time of the change of employer.</p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>Subsection (3C) requires there to be a ballot of affected employees before a UMA entered into after the Bill comes into force can be relied upon as justifying the dismissal of any employee. This will be in addition to the protection afforded to conscientious objectors and existing employees at the time of the UMA. Where, after enactment of the Bill the employer changes in such circumstances that the employees who remain employed do not break their continuity of employment—for example, upon transfer of the business—it is not intended that a ballot or fresh ballot should be required before existing arrangements carried over into the new business can take effect under the clause.</p>
	<p>The subsection as originally drafted achieved that, but only in relation to employees transferred with the business. Such employees could be fairly dismissed, assuming neither of the other

protections applied, without a new ballot, but employees taken on after the change of employer, although aware that a UMA existed, could not be fairly dismissed unless the new employer had held a ballot, which would have been required whether or not the previous employer had held a ballot.</p>
	<p>The amendments ensure that new employees are in the same position as the transferred employees and that a ballot or fresh ballot is not required upon such a change of employer. They are, therefore, technical in nature.</p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot advise my right hon. and hon. Friends just to accept the Under-Secretary's word. I shall not ask him to read through that again at dictation pace, because I doubt that I should understand and take it in. Perhaps I am a little dim and not so sharp as I ought to be.

In order to enable us to reserve our position so that, if we are dissatisfied, we may return to the point, I advise my right hon. and hon. Friends to divide the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 13, Noes 10.</p>
	<p>obviousness about the two amendments and their purpose, but the argument behind them goes much deeper. Moreover, I do not want the Committee, or anyone reading our proceedings, to assume that we are merely seeking to mitigate what we believe to be a severe hurdle for the establishment of a new union membership agreement. As we shall make clear when we come to clause stand part, we are opposed to the whole concept of the ballots provided for in this new subsection.</p>
	<p>We are not talking merely about the numbers game, although the amendment deals with that but about something that goes deeper than the manifest absurdity of the stiffness of the test which the Government seek to impose on the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0963">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>861</span>
establishment of a new union membership agreement. There may well be precious few ballots in many other fields that would satisfy the rig our of the test laid down here, not least the test of a general election. I wonder how far short of the test laid down here the present Government failed in the last general election. I understand that the mandate that they claimed to have backing for from the electorate was in fact voted for by only one-third of those entitled to vote.</p>
	<p>This subsection will lead those who aspire to participate professionally in UMAs into all kinds of difficulties if not eventually into the courts. I make no apology for quoting from the "TUC Commentary on The Employment Bill". In paragraph 19, on clause 6, it is said that under these provisions
	<br><q><p>"A new union membership agreement must have the support of 80 per cent. of the workers involved (ie. the whole electorate) voting for it by secret ballot. Ultimately the scope of the electoral unit, and the conduct and counting of the ballot would be a matter for the courts. And there could be other legal challenges in the courts about aspects of the ballots."</p></q></p>
	<p>Then it goes on to point out a matter to which I shall return, referring to the position of existing employees at the conclusion of the ballot, and in paragraph 21 it says:
	<br><q><p>"While it is true that the new law will not make UMAs unlawful (including those which do not comply with these provisions) the cumulative effect of these provisions is to attempt to weaken existing agreements and to place a very stiff obstacle course in the way of unions seeking UMAs or even operating existing ones."</p></q></p>
	<p>I want to return to the point touched upon by the TUC about the difficulty of defining both the scope of the electoral unit and the way in which the ballot will be conducted. Subsection (2) of new section 58A refers to a union membership agreement in relation to
	<br><q><p>"the emptoyees of any class of an emptoyer."</p></q>
I know that we have used similar phraseology in the past, particularly in the Employment Protection Act 1975, but in these circumstances we are entitled to ask the hon. and learned Gentleman for clearer guidelines about how that par-particular class shall be defined and determined. Who will agree to which group of employees it will apply? It seems that this will be one of the crucial issues in determining the percentage satisfactorily,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>862</span>
whether it be the one laid down in the Bill or the one in our amendment.</p>
	<p>I think that it was on this point that an organisation to which reference has been made earlier in our proceedings published its comments in its 	<i>Legal Information Bulletin.</i> I am referring to the Industrial Relations Services, a commercial organisation which provides an advisory service to employers and others. Its 	<i>Legal Information Bulletin</i>of I6 January 1980, commenting on this provision in the Bill, said:
	<br><q><p>"It would seem open to the parties to union membership agreements under the new legislation to define the ' class" covered by the agreement—and hence the employees eligible to vote on the agreement—so as to exclude those who would have the statutory right to stay out of the union anyway. In particular, existing non-members can be excluded from voting, since new clause (3C) (	<i>b</i>)provides that where a union membership agreement is approved by ballot, it is still unfair to dismiss an employee for non membership if he was not a member of the union when the ballot took place."</p></q></p>
	<p>I shall come back to that second point in a moment, but the first part of what I have quoted is the important one for the moment, asking how the group which will be balloted will be defined, who will be responsible for defining it and whether what is touched on here in this report will in fact be the case.</p>
	<p>In a situation where part of the work force is already well organised, will it be possible for that part of the work force themselves to say "We are making an application for a union membership agreement with our employer in respect of ourselves, and we therefore, in order to satisfy the provisions of the Bill, want those employees, and those employees only, to be balloted". If that is the case, quite clearly—this is what is suggested here—the provision in the Bill will have a very diffetent effect from that which has been publicised and assumed by other commentators. o I will it be the case that those who in those circustances would have been excluded from the ballot could insist that they be included as part of that group, that class of employees, or will the employer likewise be able similarly to insist?</p>
	<p>It may be that I have put over a crude argument, and I wholly accept that, but between what has been assumed and presented about the Bill so far and that extreme position that I have described—the whole grey area of indetermined matter, of indefinable decision at this stage—how will the group which will be the subject of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0964">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>863</span>
the ballot be decided, and by whom, and to what extent will that be the subject of discussion and agreement between the parties?</p>
	<p>For the purpose of my argument, when talking of the parties we are talking presumably not only of the trade union and the existing trade union members who will be seeking to establish with their employer a union membership agreement but about those who are not members of the trade union and may very well vote " No " in the subsequent ballot. We need some clarification from the hon. and learned Gentleman, not least for the guidance of those who may in the future find themselves involved in this kind of situation.</p>
	<p>I turn now to the other point which is touched upon by the Industrial Relations Services document. Even if the 80 per cent. hurdle is overcome and that requirement is satisfied, the union and its members making a bid for the establishment of a union membership agreement—a closed shop, if that is preferred—will still not have achieved their closed shop because in the Bill as at present drafted those who have voted "No" will be under no obligation subsequently to join the union that has achieved its 80 per cent. They will still have an absolute right to remain outside the closed shop agreement. They will not have to satisfy any test of conscience or religious conviction or deeply held personal conviction. It is sufficient that they have said that they do not want to belong to that union. They will have conferred upon them a statutory right to continue to be outside and—I may have misunderstood the hon. and learned Gentleman or have misinterpreted the Bill—it is then open to the employer to dismiss but to pay compensation.</p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>We have heard it explained before that the Bill is not necessarily preventing employers from agreeing new closed shops. It is aimed at giving compensation to those who have suffered loss of employment because of the establishment of a UMA. But the employer might well be faced with the dismissal of large numbers, which would result in heavy financial burdens because of the sheer numbers and the size of the compensation. Long-established employers may be able to claim up to £16,000. But it could also be a key
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>864</span>
section of his work force which he could not afford to lose in any case, even if he was willing and able to pay the compensation. What a dilemma he will be in with these provisions! I make the point to illustrate the enormous difficulty in which the Government will find themselves.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has touched upon the difficulty in which the Government may find themselves in implementing the clause. But will he address himself to a different element—the difficulties in which employers will probably find themselves? My right hon. Friend is aware, even if the Under-Secretary and the Secretary of State are not, that many large establishments are divided into different shops, all members of the same union. There can be shops A, B, C, D and E throughout the establishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A situation could arise in which three, four or five of the shops had closed shop agreements because they had met the conditions of the clause and had obtained more than 80 per cent. but other shops which had obtained only 79 per cent. of the vote would not be closed shops. There could be difficulty for employers in large establishments if they had closed shop agreements with some of their workshops and no such agreements with others. Does my right hon. Friend accept this part of clause 6 as a recipe for chaos?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. He will have recognised that this difficulty is further compounded by the provision in clause 6(2), which we have already discussed to some degree, that a person cannot object merely to belonging to any trade union whatever but to belonging to a particular trade union. That highlights the point made by my hon. Friend. I do not want to go into all the possible situations, but I shall take up his point briefly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee knows that I worked as a toolmaker in the engineering industry, and I have said that toolmakers are proud of their craft status. Tool rooms are invariably closed shops for the craftsmen, though not always so for all the tool room personnel are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sometimes there is a closed shop for everyone who works in the tool room, but sometimes the craftsmen are required to belong to a union and others who are semiskilled or unskilled are under no such
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0965">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>865</span>
obligation. But in the fitting shop next door the AUEW, my own union, may seek to recruit all the fitters and establish with the employer a union membership agreement. In the same department there may be fitters who belong to, say the National Society of Metal Mechanics. They may be servant trade union members but may have an objection to belonging to the AUEW and may vote "No".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be a further complexity. The assumption underlying the Bill is that it is catering for those who do not wish to belong to a trade union at all, because of deeply held personal conviction or on grounds of conscience. But we are talking here of quite a different creature—the person who does not have a deeply held personal conviction or conscientious objection to joining a union. He may be as good a trade unionist as you or I, Mr. Leadbitter, but he will none the less object do belonging to a particular union and, in those circumstances, will not vote for the AUEW and may therefore thwart the AUEW in its need to achieve 80 pet cent. or two-thirds or whatever percentage the eventual Act may lay down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that hypothetical situation, the class, the description of employees, would have to be determined. Would it be possible for the AUEW members in the fitting department somehow to describe themselves in a way suggested by the bulletin from which I have quoted, to ensure that they and they alone would be the participants in the ballot and thus would secure their union membership agreement?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my hon. Friend intervened, I was about to point out that all these difficulties seemed to me to stem from these provisions and many others on which I have not touched in the interests of progress. But it seems to me that someone somehow will have to make some adjudication about the conflicts that will inevitably arise. Who will that be? I do not see any provision in the event of dispute for these matters to be referred to an industrial tribunal and possibly from there to the employment appeal tribunal. It seems to me that they are matters which will be determined in the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall have the involvement of judges who, no matter how practiced, versed, experienced, skilled, and educated in judicial matters, very often—as the late Sir Winston Churchill once pointed out—ill-equipped and unfitted, by virtue of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>866</span>
experience and social background, to involve themselves in these matters which require practical experience of working men, industrial relations and factory floor life. It will mean the courts, the Lord Dennings of this world who have clearly shown their anti-trade union bias, becoming involved in the determination of these matters. When the hon. and learned Gentleman replies, would he tell us how and by whom these matters will be determined when they are in dispute, as inevitably they will be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. James Prior)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I really think that this would be a matter not for the courts but for negotiation between the union which was seeking a union membership agreement with the employer who was seeking the union membership agreement or who was prepared to consider the union membership agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman draws attention to the difficulty that there might be, as it were, with some workers in the particular shop who were members of the metal mechanics' union, or whatever union it might be, which was different from the union which was seeking the union membership agreement. It would then be a matter for the union seeking the agreement to decide with the employer the range of people who should be consulted in that case. Presumably it would not be to the advantage of the union seeking the union membership agreement that it should include people from another union who did not therefore wish to join a union membership agreement for that union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I think that these matters are best left to be sorted out on the shop floor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree wholly with the right hon. Gentleman that these matters are best left to be sorted out on the shop floor. Why then are we discussing new statutory provisions to determine these matters? It has been our argument all along that these matters are better left to be worked out by voluntary methods than to be laid down in statute. The right hon. Gentleman is now swinging our way. We are apparently having some influence with our arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Best to be sorted out on the shop floor between the union involved and the employer to decide who should be entitled to vote in a particular case. Then
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0966">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>867</span>
it would be up to the shop floor to vote whether or not it wished the union membership agreement to come in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I return to the point. If the right hon. Gentleman believes that, why does he not believe it about the whole thing? We have argued all along that these are matters best left to the shop floor. But even if we take as the right hon. Gentleman's starting point the need to lay down this basic provision here, why does he not leave it for the employer and the trade union to decide themselves what would be the appropriate criteria, what the hurdles should be? It should be left for them to decide whether it should be 80 per cent., two-thirds, or 60 per cent. In the light of what the right hon. Gentleman has said any my response to him, I hope that he will well now agree with us and promise to come forward with some amendments on Report to enable the employer and the union to agree what will be the appropriate percentage in any ballot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is because I agree that this is the best way for these things to be sorted out and then for a vote to be taken, and it is because of the experience of the past, which has suggested that many people are forced into closed shops much against their will, that we felt that it was right to lay down a requirement of 80 per cent. of those entitled to vote. It is because it has been so unfair in the past that we have introduced this element into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman says that it has been unfair in the past, but he has not so far produced much evidence. What we have discussed at some considerable length in the Committee, although not at the length at which we debated it on the Floor of the House in 1970 and 1971, is whether an individual who objects to joining a trade union should have the right to be compensated for being dismissed as a consequence of not joining a union. We have disagreed with the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends on that matter. But that is a very different matter from what is before the Committee now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the Government's arguments. I am not saying that I accept it, but I understand the case for saying that there ought to be some statutory protection for a worker in that situation. But
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>868</span>
that is a very different matter from what we have before us now. The right hon. Gentleman could merely have left it at that and said that anybody put under compulsion to join a union when he objected to being a member of a union and as a consequence lost his job, ought to be compensated. Why the right hon. Gentleman does not leave it at that, I do not understand. If he leaves it at that, in this kind of situation where a new closed shop is sought by a trade union and an individual or group of individuals do not want to join, he has the statutory provision already that they can complain to a tribunal that they have been unfairly dismissed because of a transgression of the new statutory provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my right hon. Friend aware that the Secretary of State has exposed his complete lack of knowledge of what life on the shop floor is all about? My right hon. Friend quoted the example of the AUEW and the metal mechanics, and the Secretary of State suggested that in that situation it would be best left to the trade unions to negotiate with the management rather than write provisions into Bills. But is not the real issue that would be involved in that situation negotiating rights? The Bill refers to the class, and groups of workers who belong to the same class but were not members of the same union would resist totally the suggestion that a different class should have negotiating rights for them in relation to what happened on the factory floor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend anticipates another point that I was about to put to the Committee. I was about to make the point with regard the closeness of the case for recognition and the case for a union membership agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, before I come to that, I have one other point to make. The ballot will be about whether the agreement should apply in relation to them. I hope that when the hon. and learned Gentleman replies he will tell us exactly what that means, and who will determine the question. When a particular trade union has applied for a union membership agreement, will the simple, straightforward question on the ballot paper be: "Do you support the application of union A for a union membership agreement to be established
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0967">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>869</span>
in respect of this class of workers? Answer 'Yes' or 'No'"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to be assumed by the Secretary of State and the hon. and learned Gentleman that those who may reply "No" in that situation are people who object to belonging to a trade union, whereas they may be saying something different. Let us suppose that the Transport and General Workers Union has applied for a union membership agreement. In that establishment, 70 per cent. of the workers may be members of the Transport and General Workers Union, and 30 per cent. may be members of the General and Municipal Workers Union. There are no non-unionists at all. Every employee is a dedicated trade unionist. But, because it is the Transport and General Workers Union that has applied, the General and Municipal Workers Union members will have no option, it seems to me, but to vote "No" initially because clearly they have a loyalty to their own union. Is it to be assumed, because there is a 30 per cent. "No" vote, that 30 per cent. of the workers in that establishment object to belonging to a trade union? That seems to be the assumption on which the Government are framing these proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case might be different had the question been framed:
	<br><q><p>"A. Do you wish the Transport and General Workers Union to have a union membership agreement in respect of all the workers here?</p></q>
	<br><q><p>B. In the event of the Transport and General Workers Union succeeding in its application, would you wish to join the Transport and General Workers Union?</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Alternatively, if the application does not succeed, would you wish another union to seek to establish a union membership agreement in this situation?"</p></q>
I do not know the answer to this. I am asking the Secretary of State who is to determine what the questions should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will no doubt say, consistent with his earlier remarks, that these are matters that can best be determined by discussion between the union making the application and the employer. I agree with this, but where does the General and Municipal Workers Union discussion come in here? The T&GWU has made an application for a UMA. Is there an obligation on the employer to notify the General and Municipal Workers Union and any other union that such an application has been received and to ask whether they have any views on it. Ought
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>870</span>
they to have a say in what goes on the ballot paper? Or is the General and Municipal Workers Union faced with a 	<i>fait accompli?</i>Suddenly, one day, it gets a message at its headquarters to say that the T&GWU has established a UMA; bad luck for its members, they had better discuss a transfer of engagement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my right hon. Friend is right in his assumption, which I gather is an assumption, that only one union at a time can be negotiating a union membership agreement. I do not see anything in the Bill which would preclude, in the circumstances my right hon. Friend is describing, both the Transport and General Workers Union and the General and Municipal Workers Union going jointly to the employer to negotiate an agreement, specifying the types of job which would be covered by each of the unions. I am asking whether I am making the right assumption or not. I see nothing in the Bill that would prevent that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) is anticipating what I intended to say about this being consistent in many ways with applications for recognition. I think that the point my hon. Friend is making is illustrated by a case to which I wish to make reference, and to which I have referred in an earlier sitting of the Committee, of the application by the United Kingdom Association of Professional Engineers for recognition by Messrs. W. H. Allen of Bedford. This was a case that was referred to ACAS through the statutory recognition provisions—sections 11 to 16 of the Employment Protection Act 1975—and which subsequently was the subject of proceedings in the courts. If I recall correctly, the United Kingdom Association of Professional Engineers had managed to recruit a number of people in that company who were—I will have to be careful about the use of the phrase class of employees" here—of a class of employees in respect of which the employer already recognised one or perhaps two other unions, of which my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) was for many years a distinguished officer, and the TASS section of the AUEW.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>871</span>
In those circumstances, the Service carried out a ballot of the employees of the class concerned and was able to pose—because it had the necessary flexibility under the statutory provisions—different questions which stemmed from the recognition that there were other unions that had an interest in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From recognition to the pursuit of a union membership agreement is but a short step. For recognition in that situation let us think of, and substitute the words, "union membership agreement". This is the situation which my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham was drawing to the attention of the Committee. I agree entirely with him because this was the kind of situation that I had in mind. It is difficult to reconcile the reality of that kind of situation with what I think is the assumption on which the new provision in this clause is based. It illustrates all the difficulties that will arise from the definition and determination of the size of the group and the role of the different trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return now to the point that I was making when the Secretary of State interrupted me. When these conflicts and divisions emerge, someone will have to make a decision. It seems to me—despite what the right hon. Gentleman has said about these matters being best left to be determined between the employer and the trade union—that because the matters they are seeking agreement about are statutory provisions, there is really no point in making statutory provisions, which are part of the law, and then saying that it is for those who are involved to agree about what the statutory provisions mean. If that was the case there would be no point in making statutory provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When questions arise, if those questions are to be determined by voluntary agreement, they should be based on a voluntary agreement in the first place. I have often been involved in the making of industrial agreements. We who had made the agreement—the employer, myself and my colleagues, the shop stewards' committee—would agree that if a dispute arose it was for us to interpret it. If we could not agree, there was a voluntary procedure laid down by means of which we could go through the engineering disputes procedure. There were different stages, but at every stage it was a voluntary procedure. It was only voluntary because it started off on questions of interpretation as a voluntary agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>872</span>
Here, we are talking about the interpretation in the future not of a voluntary agreement but of something put into an Act of Parliament by this Committee and by the House of Commons and the House of Lords. There is no point in putting it in unless it is assumed that it will be determined by some kind of judicial body in the event of conflict or dispute. Because there is no provision in the Bill for going to an industrial tribunal when there is a dispute, one assumes that it will go to the courts. There is so much fertile ground here for the litigious-minded, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow described them, to nip off to the High Court to get a judgment about these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is this a sensible way to determine these difficult and sensitive matters? I very much doubt it. I think the most sensible thing that the Secretary of State has said since he launched the Bill is his intervention in my remarks this morning when he was saying that these were matters best determined by discussion and voluntary agreement between the parties. That is absolutely right, and the right hon. Gentleman should start off by basing the whole thing on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much as we disagree with the right hon. Gentleman's changes in the law relating to conscientious objection to membership of a trade union—grounds of conviction—it seems to me that that provides all that he needs. We do not need all this nonsense and morass and quagmire that he will create with all the roads leading down a mass of avenues joining together at the High Court. I suggest that he should think again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must advise my hon. Friends to reject these two amendments, because they would have the effect of reducing the 80 per cent. to two-thirds, and to two-thirds of those voting in favour of the application for the closed shop. So it would make a material difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The view of the Government has always been that the introduction of a new closed shop marks such a substantial change in the terms and conditions of employment that it is right that a very large percentage of those who will be covered by it vote in its favour. It is a very important step when a closed shop is brought in. As Opposition Members probably know better than most, it is very unusual for a union
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0969">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>873</span>
to make an application for a closed shop until it has between 85 and 95 per cent. of the membership. Until it can prove that, it does not make an application to the management for a union membership agreement. Therefore, we thought that there ought to be at least the 80 per cent. vote by all those entitled to vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the consultations that we had on the consultative document, it was interesting to hear the requirements of individual firms. For example, Philips Industries have a prior requirement of 90 per cent. union membership before a UMA is discussed; The British Institute of Management requires 80 per cent. of employees; the Food Manufacturers' Federation requires 85 per cent., a reasonable indication of overwhelming support. So we are talking in terms of the practice in industry at the moment, which the right hon. Gentleman knows only too well, of having about 85 to 90 per cent. union membership before a union membership agreement comes in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my right hon. Friend aware that I and perhaps the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) would have preferred the figure to have been 100 per cent. Therefore, taking a medium figure between my position and that of the Opposition, he has just about hit the right figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the right hon. Gentleman aware of the views of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>874</span>
chairman of the CBI's employment committee, Mr. Astley Whittal? He recently addressed an Institute of Personnel Management conference, and I quote from the journal:
	<br><q><p>"Astley Whittall—felt, although this was a personal and not partieularly a CBI view, that the 80 per cent. required to vote in favour of a closed shop had been set too high and was quite unreasonable."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Engineering Employers' Federation wrote to us and said that there should be an overwhelming majority. As Mr. Whittall was at one time president of the Engineering Employers' Federation, I would have thought that an overwhelming majority was certainly not less than 80 per cent. and probably would be more on the lines of the figure suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst). I know that he is opposed as a matter of principle to the closed shop in any shape, form or disguise. All I am telling him is that I believe that, if 80 per cent. of all those entitled to vote vote in favour of a closed shop, that is a very high percentage indeed. Anyone who abstains is still counted as being someone who is entitled to vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
