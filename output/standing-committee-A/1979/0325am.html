</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jocelyn Cadbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like some hon. Members opposite, I have had some experience of standing on picket lines, but my objective was, I suspect, rather different from theirs in that I was trying to persuade drivers to bring their vehicles into a factory through a picket line which was obviously trying to keep them out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last Thursday I listened carefully to what my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) said. Having done so, I feel that I must ask for an assurance from my hon. and learned Friend that clause 14 in its present form, without the much stronger provisions enshrined in my hon. Friend's amendment, will deal effectively with the kind of situation we had in the 1979 lorry drivers' strike, where relatively small numbers of pickets strategically placed were able to bring about great devastation to industry. I shall emphasise my point by giving two examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first example was the enormous
	<span class='label label-info column'>1482</span>
damage done to ICI during the 1979 strike. It is important to emphasise that not one employee of ICI was actually involved in the dispute, yet 38 of its factories were shut down and £100 million worth of sales were lost, of which £30 million was for export. The same story was repeated throughout industry, and this has happened again in the steel strike.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is that, translated on to a national scale, secondary picketing has meant that these disputes, instead of being contained at their place of origin—as they should be, according to good industrial relations practice—are now taking a fearful toll throughout the whole of industry. If, as I believe to be the case, secondary picketing has actually destroyed jobs on a significant scale, I cannot see how the Opposition can be content to allow it to remain a regular feature of British industrial life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second example is the events which took place outside the factory where I was working during that strike in 1979. One morning, right out of the blue, flying pickets arrived. They failed to dissaude the workers in our factory from going in, which was not surprising as they had no wish to be involved in the dispute. They could only lose by it. But the pickets then turned their attention to lorries, and these they had more effect in stopping. The reason that they were effective is that many lorry drivers will simply not go through any picket line. Some companies will not allow their own drivers to go through a picket line for fear of being blacked. In other cases it is enough—I have actually stood on the picket line and watched this—if pickets ask a few questions such as what union a lorry driver belongs to or whether they can see his union card, the kind of so-called lawful intimidation that was referred to last week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no need for overt intimidation. The effect is the same, which is to cut off essential materials to a plant and to cause lay-offs among thousands of workers who have no involvement and want no involvement in the dispute. Only a small number of people are needed to bring a complex process plant to a halt very quickly. In the case that I witnessed, the anger of employees in the factory was such that a large phalanx of women production workers came out in the lunch hour and virtually drove them away, in a less than peaceful manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondary picketing means the involve-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1299">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1483</span>
ment of innocent working people in a dispute against their will. That is what the clause is designed to prevent. I put two questions to my hon. and learned Friend. First, once the injunction has been taken out on the leader or organiser of the secondary pickets, how will it be spread so that it is effective to deal with other members of the picket line and with new pickets who may arrive on a subsequent day? In the case that I witnessed, on one day there was one group of people and on the next they were replaced by a different group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A very good question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cadbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Second, what is the time scale for obtaining an injunction and making it effective? In the instance that I have given, the stopping of trucks going into a factory soon began to bring it to a halt. Therefore, speed is of the essence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The wisdom with which you have occupied the Chair, Mr. Leadbitter, happily matched only by the wisdom with which Mr. Goodhew has done the same, has permitted us on the first group of amendments to discuss the whole principle of the clause. We have really had a stand part debate, which has been extremely helpful. It enables me, without seeming to be discourteous in any way to those who have moved or spoken to these amendments from the Opposition Benches, to deal briefly with the first amendment, No. 171.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of that amendment would be to delete the whole of subsection (2) and with it the heart and purpose of clause 14. The subsection provides that section 13 immunity shall not apply to anything done while picketing elsewhere than at the picket's own place of work, which would be actionable at common law. In other words, if one interferes as a picket with a business elsewhere than where one works oneself, one risks an action—in practice, as we know, for an injunction, but nominally for damages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last Thursday, I once again detained the Committee for too long in explaining the Government's commitment to the principle of the clause, but I hope that it is beyond dispute that I did explain it. It will therefore be apparent to the Committee why the Government cannot possibly
	<span class='label label-info column'>1484</span>
accept amendment No. 171. I shall not return to those arguments this morning because, if the Opposition were not persuaded by them on Thursday, the intervention of a mere weekend will not have sufficed for them to acquire wisdom, whereas if, as I suspect, I satisfied my right hon. and hon. Friends, I might risk undoing all the good work today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore pass at once to amendment No. 170. The effect would be that those picketing outside the new section 15 as provided by clause 14 would lose the immunity provided by section 13(1) of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 but would, apparently, keep the immunity provided by the rest of section 13.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would create the opposite of certainty. It would convey to the courts that Parliament intended some immunity to remain under section 13 for all picketing, but it would not say clearly what. It could have the effect of retaining the immunity for indirect inducement of a breach of contract of employment and, if so, it would seriously weaken the effectiveness of the Government's proposal because retained would be immunity under subsections (2), (3) and (4) of section 13.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) of section 13, which would be retained, relates to immunity when interfering with a trade, business or employment, and in so far as the common law would provide a right of action to an employer or to an employee suffering such interference, we should not wish to see immunity from such civil action conferred on the responsible pickets unless they picketed at their own place of work. There is no difference in principle, we believe, between the interference to which section 13(1) relates, the immunity for which would be left untouched by amendment No. 170, and the interference which is governed by section 13(2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 13(3) also confers a fairly important immunity, and we do not believe that it would be right that picketing other than at one's own place of work should be protected in those circumstances. We think that the same principle applies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 13(4) relates to liability for conspiracy. Therefore, we do not think that it would be right to accede to amendment No. 170. The hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) intervened on this point at our last sitting and he raised the hypothesis of what he called licensed pickets being joined on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1300">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1485</span>
picket line by unlicensed pickets—that is, pickets who were not at their own place of work—of their own accord and not invited. My right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General dealt with this briefly on Tuesday last. It is the subject matter of amendment No. 174, and I shall come back to that in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to amendment No. 68, which my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) presented last Thursday. The effect of this is additionally to make a trade union corporately liable in a proper case whenever an action lies at common law in respect of interference of a kind to which section 13 at present applies immunity from civil action. He would add "14" to the clause. It was the belief that clause 14 would prove insufficiently effective that lay behind my hon. Friend's amendment and, as I understand it, behind the speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Wolfson) on Thursday evening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make three observations in outline in response to those speeches. First, I believe that the clause is likely to prove very much more effective than either of my hon. Friends supposes. Second, to the extent that difficulty may be found in enforcing it—and there will be circumstances where some difficulty will be found—the different remedies that they propose will not resolve that difficulty but they will create difficulties of their own. My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North says that union funds should be made liable, my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks says that there should be an injunction against the act of picketing, and doubts about effectiveness have been expressed this morning by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Cadbury), to whose speech I shall come back a little later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third comment is this. If my hon. Friends want absolute certainty of enforcement, I believe that they must face the fact that civil remedies alone can never provide it. The civil law by itself can never provide a totally watertight bulkhead against the abuse of union power on the picket line. If it is certainty that they want, they must recognise that the criminal law would have to be employed. I do not believe that any of my hon. Friends, with their experience of picket lines and of the realities of industrial life, would wish to go that far, and I am
	<span class='label label-info column'>1486</span>
certain that to do so would be a grave mistake. Certainly, until it were shown beyond doubt that the civil law was incapable of preserving the rights of individuals, it would be a grave mistake to make picketing in any circumstances a criminal offence. I know that none of my hon. Friends has proposed that in this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point about certainty, but would my hon. and learned Friend address himself to another element which perhaps was not fully spelt out in my speech—that is, the element of deterrence? If one deters a trade union from supporting and encouraging because its funds will be put at risk, that is a further element which will assist to rectify a situation that will otherwise be unacceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall of course deal with that, and in a moment or two, if my hon. Friend will allow me. Let me say this at this juncture. I do not criticise his proposal on the ground of deterrence. I think that it would deter. I criticise it on the ground that, in order to make a union liable, we first have to show that a wrongful act has been committed by somebody on its behalf for whom the union is vicariously liable. If it is possible to identify him, then the principal difficulty which has been dwelt upon, for reasons which I wholly understand, by those who criticise the present clause as being ineffective is overcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principal difficulty is that it is hard to find out who is organising the thing. Once he has been identified, one's problems are over. There has been a long series of cases, of which the most recent was that of Mr. Sirs in Duport Steels v. Sirs in January 1980. Once he is identified, an injunction can be served. But somebody has to be identified who has been acting in that way on behalf of the union before use can be made of the provision which my hon. Friend's amendment would incorporate in the Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the Under-Secretary said about Mr. Sirs. Here, one person has been picked out. The Attorney-General said it would be quite easy to pick out an organiser. Can the Under-Secretary envisage the circumstances in real life where the workers concerned feel strongly about an issue and,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1301">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1487</span>
because their officials are constrained by legal action, instead of rallying to the support of the equivalent of Mr. Sirs, they say they will ignore Mr. Sirs and will carry out unofficial action. That would be a recipe for anarchy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can visualise such a situation. But in such a situation the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North would be useless. Even if the law is changed so as to repeal section 14 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act and to make union funds vulnerable, one cannot do it unless one can show that the action complained of on the picket line was done on behalf of the trade union and with its knowledge. If it were unofficial, in those circumstances that would not be possible. I shall come back to that in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish now to amplify the first of my responses to the charge that the clause will be ineffective and to substantiate my contention that it will be much more effective than my hon. Friends appear to suppose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North said that if one is assailed by a swarm of bees it is necessary to get at the hive so that they do not come back. With some apiarist experience of my own, I can think of no better way of getting stung. If it is possible, however—if I may pursue the interesting analogy—to identify and isolate the queen which is causing the swarm, one is beginning to make some progress. It is exactly in that way the law at present operates, and it is exactly in that way that the clause would permit the law to operate, but on a much wider scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has to be done is to seek out the organiser and serve the civil proceedings upon him. The problem is that, because the law is so widely expressed, following the interpretation by the other place of the previous Government's legislation in the case of Express Newspapers v. MacShane, there is virtually unlimited immunity for any interference with contractual relations carried out by a picket, whether or not he is picketing his own workplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in order to restrict that substantially that clause 14 is included in the Bill, and in those circumstances we believe that the existing law, which has been shown to be effective in other contexts, can be made much more effective by the provisions of clause 14.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1488</span>
It is said that it will not be possible to find out the organiser. I understand well that this factor causes anxiety to many supporters of the Bill's theme and purpose, and I wish to deal with it. To say that in many cases it will be impossible to find the organiser is to pay scant regard to reality. A picket organiser is generally anxious to proclaim who he is, what he is doing, and why he is doing it. I do not suppose that there will be any greater reluctance to proclaim that in future than there has been in the past. If, however, I am wrong about that, I say, secondly, that with a little ingenuity, intelligence and straight observation it will not be difficult to find out who he is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The identity of the organiser will, after all, be a matter of interest to the media, to other employers and an employer's own workers. Let us not forget that in this context we are talking only about pickets who do not work at the plant being picketed but are seeking to persuade those workers not to come in to work and to break their contract, at considerable loss to themselves. Would it not be of some interest to them to know who is organising the picket and who is behind it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A line of stranger pickets, as the Americans call them, takes a great deal of organising. Refreshments must be laid on, and transport provided. There are picketing expenses which now, apparently, are so necessary in order to maintain unrestricted the pure flow of spontaneous indignation. All these matters will, surely, provide clues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But even if that be not so, I say, thirdly, what will be the influence upon a well led work force of an anonymous picket line, anonymously led, seeking to persuade workers to stop working for an employer with whom they have no dispute, at substantial cost to themselves? It ought not to be noticeable, and certainly the new remedies for unreasonable expulsion from a union in a closed shop, which this Bill will confer, will have significant effects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North said that there will always be a small minority who will bring the law into disrepute. That may be—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. and learned Friend allow me to take him back to his reference to bees and the hive? All right, let the Minister isolate the queen bee back in the hive if he wishes, but if he wants to remove the queen from the hive—I am
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1302">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1489</span>
not sure how beehives work in detail, but I believe that the beehive itself has to be destroyed, and I have no desire to destroy totally a trade union—[	<i>Laughter.</i>]—if there is to be any destruction, let it be self-destruction, not done by me. If the removal of a queen bee does not destroy the hive, perhaps she is replaced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At all events, what I seek to do is to ensure that the sustenance back in the hive should be at risk. That would be the honey, and I say go for the funds of the trade union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's speech last Thursday was as much about the birds as about the bees, I seem to remember.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And an olive branch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and an olive branch, too. My hon. Friend has made an important observation, I agree. As it happens, I believe that the queen that causes the swarm is at the very centre of the swarm, but we shall not go into that too closely. My hon. Friend says let us get at the sustenance of the hive and that will act as a deterrent. I promise him that in a second or two I will come to that point. I have acknowledged that, if one can make union funds vulnerable, it acts as a deterrent. But the difficulty is that, in order to make them vulnerable, one has to overcome the hurdle which is at the root of my hon. Friend's objections to the efficacy of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend said that a small minority would bring the law into dispute. That may be so, but historical experience shows, as we have acknowledged in the Committee, that when an order of the High Court or of the Court of Appeal is made, unions stand by it and comply with it. The other day Mr. Sirs was only the last in a virtually consistent and unbroken pattern of obedience to the orders of the court. The court will enforce its order through its own contempt procedures, and that will be a matter for the court, not for the employer. The employer will have to make his complaint that the order is not being complied with. Thereafter it is up to the court. I believe that just as much ingenuity is available to the courts to keep a would-be martyr out of prison—whilst subjecting him, I trust, to protracted inconvenience—as he may himself display in order to get himself into prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1490</span>
If, in spite of everything, somebody succeeds in busting his way into prison, what kind of martyr will he be? He will be acting in defiance of the order of the court, itself made in order to enforce an Act of a democratically-elected Parliament, itself the result of a policy spelt out in detail at the time of a general election, and subsequently widely consulted upon. What kind of martyr will he be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the Pentonville Five?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hardly in the class of some of the better-known predecessors of Dr. Runcie, not in a Latimer and Ridley category, lighting a candle that will never be put out. The hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) refers to the Pentonville Five. But let it not be forgotten that the objection there was primarily to the National Industrial Relations Co4urt and the whole new structure that derived from the 1971 Act. I do not excuse that action, but it was an almost unique matter, a different matter from a union defying the orders of the High Court. But it cannot be excluded and I acknowledge that. But let us not be so deterred by the possibility, and a remote one if experience is anything to go by, of that kind of defiance from the need to take the kind of action that the Bill proposes. But if, in spite of everything, that comes about, we must face it, but the important thing is to make sure that the legislation is as reasonable as may be and does not go further than is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But in any event—and I say this to my hon. Friends—to make unions liable to lose their funds for secondary picketing would prove no more effective. Immediate injunctions and not damages are the name of the game. That is what an employer in these circumstances wants. He does not want to pursue an action to judgment 18 months later when everybody would far sooner leave the matter forgotten. He wants an injunction and union funds are quite irrelevant to the question of whether or not he will get one. They do not have to be paid for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, even if union funds were to be made vulnerable as my hon, Friend proposes, an employer would still have to establish that the picketing was the work of an indentified union official for whom the union was vicariously responsible as his principal, which I think is the very
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1303">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1491</span>
difficulty to which my hon. Friend objects in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our present view is that no discernible gain would be achieved by making union funds liable for the consequences of picketing in the terms that my hon. Friend's amendment proposes. This reform could not help in the case of unofficial action for the reasons that I have already mentioned in answer to the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton). I wonder whether my hon. Friend and those who may think as he does have taken proper account of the fact that only 5 per cent. of strikes are official strikes organised by the union. The proportion of official to unofficial action could hardly be expected to increase if the amendment were enacted. Meanwhile, we should have revived the great difficulties that the courts had after 1971, when we went down this road, in deciding whether a union was responsible for the acts of its members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore our present view is that, in the context of picketing, my hon. Friend's amendment would only move the problem sideways for no discernible gain but at the cost of the symbolic act of removing the corporate immunity from unions which Parliament conferred following the Taff Vale decision and other decisions of some 75 years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks proposed that, in order to meet the difficulties of enforcing the clause, we should enact provision for an injunction against the act of picketing. I understand why that attracts him. But it would, in practice, be of little help in the face of determined and continued picketing. The court could do nothing more to enforce the injunction without the names and addresses of those who were defying it. The problem would therefore remain, but the likelihood of the injunction being ignored and of the law being brought into dispute would be present on a far wider scale, with proportionately greater damage. One would be able to obtain the names and addresses of those who were defying this blanket injunction against picketing only by the use of the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my hon. Friend, with his great experience of industrial relations, whether he wishes to bring the police into the enforcement of an order of the court
	<span class='label label-info column'>1492</span>
obtained in civil proceedings at the suit of one party to an industrial dispute. I know of no other context in the civil law in which the services of the police can be required in that way. I am confident that the police would be extremely reluctant to take that burden on, and I am equally confident that the exacerbation of the situation that would then exist would far outweigh any advantage that would be gained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a superficial similarity between my hon. Friend's proposal, if he will allow me to say so, and the procedure for regaining possession of property under Rule 113 of the Rules of the Supreme Court—the squatters' provision, which the courts themselves developed a few years ago. But it is no more than superficial because the purpose of the possession procedure is to enable the court to authorise the retaking of possession of what is one's own property by forcible entry, if need be, and without first having to identify by name the people inside who are wrongfully occupying it as trespassers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is its purpose. It does not provide a new remedy but rather a new procedure for the exercise of the existing remedy. Once that procedure is used and the remedy obtained, the question of recurrence does not come into it. One is there for one's own possession. One knows that these specific people are inside but one cannot name them. One has got them out. Therefore it is a very different matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With picketing, one would not be recovering possession of one's own property. One would not be ejecting anyone. One would be seeking to restrain, not everyone present outside one's gate, but only those seeking to induce members of one's work force to break their contracts. If they continued, one would have to identify them to the court and one would be once again back where one started. That is the difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Wolfson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although this may be a superficial comparison, would there not be relevance in turning the situation round and making it necessary for those pickets to identify themselves, to prove whether they were picketing lawfully or unlawfully? The onus could be on them to make their identification. If they were lawful pickets, well and good. If not, the force of the law could be used to make the injunction stick.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1304">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1493</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow that argument but the difficulty remains. My hon. Friend asks whether they could not be made to do this. But who makes them and what happens if they do not? If there is to be any sanction they must be identified, and that lies at the root of my hon. Friend's objection to the clause as it is. There is no way of making people give their names unless they are required to do so under the criminal law by use of the police. If they do not do so they lose their immunity, says my hon. Friend, but there again, in order to carry the matter forward, they have to be identified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would never pretend that the civil law can provide a watertight bulkhead. That can only be achieved by making secondary picketing a crime. But the civil law, fortified by clause 14, can do a great deal. Of course, the employers w ill need to use it, and perhaps they will not. If, as my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks suggested, they are reluctant to use it in defence of their own civil rights, no one else is likely to employ it for them. But I do not see that there is much wrong with that. I do, however, see a great deal wrong with involving the police, and much more with adding to the criminal law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I told the hon. and learned Member for Accrington that I would deal further with the point about conspiracy. I showed him the notes that I proposed to make and have already detained the Committee an unconscionable time. If he would be kind enough to allow the matter to go—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, please go on. It is very interesting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very well. Then I will. The argument on the conspiracy point, which is under amendment No. 170, centres on the words used by Lord Devlin in Rookes v. Barnard, that if it was established that a person was doing an unlawful act, the plaintiff could sue the doer of the act and the conspirators, if any, as well. I think that is the fear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is little in subsequent cases to suggest that Lord Devlin's remarks are likely to be used or developed. It is quite possible even now for peaceful and lawful pickets to be joined on a picket line by others who commit unlawful acts such as nuisance or trespass. But I am not aware of any case where an action on conspiracy has been instituted against either the un-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1494</span>
lawful pickets or the peaceful pickets. All the cases have been brought against the identified law-breakers for the doing of the act rather than against them or others for conspiring to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it is difficult to compare the circumstances of the case of Rookes v. Barnard with cases of picketing. That case was not about picketing but about the threat of a strike in breach of contracts. It did not involve interference with contracts, which is the normal tort committed by pickets. The courts accepted that this was protected by the 1906 Act. The case centred rather on whether a breach of contract of employment constituted unlawful means for the purpose of the tort of intimidation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, with the possible exception of Lord Devlin, the Law Lords do not seem to have distinguished the defendants who are acting unlawfully from those who are simply conspiring to do an unlawful act, as they would be required to do in the case of primary and secondary pickets. They seem to have decided in that case not only that all the defendants were conspiring to commit the tort of intimidation, but that they were actually doing it, that is, were acting unlawfully, which would not be open in the case of lawful pickets outside their own place of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, even if one regards Lord Devlin's remarks as 	<i>obiter dicta</i> which may still be followed in a case today, they provide no authority for the view, I believe, that a person can be guilty simply by association. This is the point that my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General was making the other day. This was never considered by Lord Devlin because there was no question that all the defendants had combined and colluded in threatening a strike, that is, that they had taken positive steps to conspire together. Therefore, for those reasons, I believe that theanxieties that lie behind amendment No. 174 and the hon. and learned Gentleman's speech the other day can be allayed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for having detained the Committee. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Northfield feels that I have, in the course of my earlier remarks, dealt with the points he made. I believe that the clause without the amendments is as effective as the civil law alone can be. It would have enabled employers in the two examples that he cited—ICI and the Cadbury factory—last year to have identified and obtained injunctions against
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1305">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1495</span>
those who were organising the stopping of the lorries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cadbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point on which I was seeking clarification is that, once the leader of the secondary pickets has been identified, how are the remaining members of the picket line to be then involved and any subsequent pickets who come to replace them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General said, if somebody is restrained by injunction from organising a picket line, he cannot be excused if he merely rotates the people who are on the picket line on Tuesday and replaces them with somebody else on Wednesday. Nor is it an excuse for anybody who, with knowledge of that injunction and with the intention of helping the person restrained by the injunction to break it, himself stands in the shoes of somebody who was there the day before. In other words, it is not only the organiser, but it is everybody associated with him acting on his behalf who is caught, as it were, by the injunction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The courts make these injunctions today extremely widely. Therefore, while acknowledging that the civil law cannot create a wholly watertight bulkhead against the abuse of union powers on the picket line, the clause provides as strong and effective a remedy, I believe, as any use of the civil law can do. If one wants to go further one is driven into the criminal law country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather disturbed if the hon. and learned Gentleman is now about to conclude his speech without commenting at all on the point which I made during the debate and which I thought was rather important. I was trying to point out what seemed to be a considerable injustice arising from the relationship between clause 14 and the working paper in which the Government made it clear that they intended that the extension of an industrial dispute to involve the firm which is the first supplier or first customer of the one originally involved in the dispute will not in itself be actionable, and in that sense it will be lawful for people to use any industrial action except picketing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary explained that the reason why they the Government exclude solely picketing from the means which can
	<span class='label label-info column'>1496</span>
be used is that it is in their view the easiest way. It strikes me as rather odd, to say the least, to say that people will be liable to action for using what the Government consider the easiest way to do something which in itself will not render them liable to action. That surely must be the ultimate triumph of expediency over principle, and we need a better explanation of the Government's case if they feel that they can justify it. Simply to say that people can do this but they must do it in the easiest way seems to me to be nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Gentleman. I took a full note of his remarks and I am sorry to have omitted them. That was the point that he made, and I had dealt with it in a speech which I made on the first group. I certainly said that it was the easiest way in which a union could bring pressure to bear upon an employer who is not the employer with whom it is principally in dispute. But I also said that we singled out picketing for more restrictive treatment because it depended in reality upon frightening people in many cases—not necessarily to the extent of the criminal offence of intimidation, not even necessarily to the extent of the civil wrong of intimidation, but it depended upon frightening them to believe that they would lose, for example in a closed shop, their union card and with it their right to work in the only trade they knew if they crossed a picket line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the connotation for public order, plus the basis of frightening people, to which I have just referred, plus the fact that it is the easiest means of bringing industrial pressure to bear upon an employer with whom one is not in dispute, justifies singling picketing out for specially restrictive treatment. That is why we expressly set that policy and proposal out in our manifesto. This is not something which has been brought in since the election and incorporated in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is surely as easy to make threats which are short of criminal intimidation—threats about the loss of union cards and things like that—in a letter as it is verbally at the factory gate, is it not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed it is, but not so effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1306">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1497</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: More effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not so effectively. I suggest that it is a matter of judgment and one's knowledge of life—not so effectively and as easily as it is to do when there is a substantial number of pickets shouting round a gate, preventing the passage of a lorry, making these threats and holding out this fear to somebody there and then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If someone receives a letter, he can quietly consider what to do. He can take advice. I am sure that the hon. Member realises that it is a very different matter when someone has to face that kind of behaviour at the picket on the gate in the circumstances with which we are familiar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I accept that amendment No. 171, in the words of the Minister, goes to the heart and purpose of the Bill. I should have said just to the heart, but the Minister added the word "purpose" Clearly at this stage we have debated the purpose of the clause ad nauseam, and it is the Opposition's purpose that the immunity which at present extends to legitimate and peaceful secondary picketing should continue. That is why I advise my hon. Friends—though I do not think they need advice—to press the amendment to a Division and to vote against the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of amendment No. 170 by also taking away the immunity of section 13 (3) and (4) in particular, which I might call the "unlawful means" section and the "conspiracy" section, I submit that lawful pickets as defined in the Bill—unlawful pickets are not defined in the Bill—and unlawful pickets as they emerge from the Bill, would be at considerable risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister in a variety of ways, for instance, for lending me the notes. I do not base my argument entirely upon Lord Devlin's remarks. I feel that those remarks, in conjunction with taking away the immunity of section 13 (3), the "unlawful means" section, and of section 13 (4), will put at risk the lawful picket, picketing outside his own workplace, and the unlawful picket who joins him, not necessarily because he has been invited but because he is part and parcel of the same dispute, except that he does not work at that particular site or plant. If the unlawful picket joins the lawful picket in stopping a lorry going into the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1498</span>
works, and if the unlawful picket is somewhat more effective than the lawful picket in stopping the lorry, I suggest that the lawful picket as well as the unlawful picket is at risk from an injunction or ultimately an action for damages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman said that that it is not so. We shall have to agree to differ on that matter. Only time will tell. I hope that the Minister is right and that I am wrong. However, I do not consider that it is necessary for me to sum up further. In view of what the hon. and learned Gentleman has said I urge my hon. Friends to press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that my hon. and learned Friend's performance is a triumph of personal amiability, as well as great clarity and ingenuity. But I suggest that it has been at the expense of the real world and the realities in which we have to operate. I wish that I could have accepted my hon. and learned Friend's arguments. I am reminded that Theodore Roosevelt said that if one spoke softly, one should carry a big stick, and one would then go far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause certainly speaks softly but it will not go very far because far from having a big stick, I do not believe it has any stick. It may have a magic wand, but that is about the limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend has not really answered the question which I put to him last Thursday. He has dealt with it, but has not told me what will be the Government's fall-back position if this measure proves to be unsatisfactory. He has dealt with the question of criminal sanctions. They are out. He has dealt with union funds, which I have suggested in this amendment, but he finds that suggestion to be unworkable. What is left? From what my hon. and learned Friend said, there is no fall-back position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept that it is unworkable to constrain union funds, and I would be perfectly prepared, on another occasion, to demonstrate that this is possible. However, I will not detain the Committee with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government must be, and must be seen to be, armed with effective measures if they are to be respected and able to implement their policies. When all that my hon. and learned Friend can say is that this clause will be as effective as the civil law can be, or, as he said at another
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1307">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1499</span>
moment that it will be more effective than we suppose, that is not good enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to end by quoting from The Proverbs of Hell by William Blake:
	<br><blockquote><p>"He who desires but acts not breeds pestilence"</p></blockquote>
There is too much wishful thinking in this clause. The disease or pestilence will persist. I readily accept that I may be in a minority in the Committee in holding this view, but I believe that a minority of one on an issue of this magnitude is preferable to being one of a majority, indeed a uninimity, on something which I believe to be basically unsound.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I raise two points of order, Mr. Leadbitter. First, on earlier clauses the Government very helpfully provided the Committee with the Minister's background briefing. Shortly we shall reach clause 15 which, notwithstanding the complexity of other parts of the Bill with which we have dealt, is extremely complex to say the least. Have the Government any intention of providing</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1500</span>
	<p>picket lines? I wonder whether he has in mind recommending to his hon. and right hon. Friends that they should follow the example of the Government of the Republic of Chile which dealt with picketing very easily by assembling all the pickets in a football stadium and shooting a large number of them on the spot. That seems to be a course of action, which, judging from his observations, would recommend itself to the hon. Gentleman—[Hon. Members: "Shame."]—but I have better regard for the members of the Government than to think it commends itself to them.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 9, Noes 13.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 1, Noes 20.</p>
	<p>us with similar guidance notes? I am glad to see reassurance coming from the Government Front Bench, and I think that, because we may well reach clause 15 early, it would be helpful to have the notes on the table now.</p>
	<p>The other point of order, Mr. Leadbitter, is this. You may recall, I think you were in the Chair, when some sittings ago I came from a meeting of the all-party disablement group with which I had been discussing amendments tabled in the name
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1308">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1501</span>
of my hon. Friends which form a new clause dealing with antenatal care and right to time off. I said that I had been told by people who were not Members of Parliament on that occasion that the form of those amendments did not matter much because they had been assured by the Government that they would be accepted in principle anyhow. I said that this was yet another example of the way in which the Government were treating the Committee with contempt. I am astonished to see that they appear to have paid little heed to the complaints that I have made. I am sure that I reflected the views of other hon. Members because I see on today's Amendment Paper that the Secretary of State has tabled a new clause 16 which anticipates, and I must say puts in better form, the substance of the new clause tabled by my hon. Friends. I make no complaint if the right hon. Gentleman studied the amendment that we have tabled and has sought to respond to it in advance and thus save the time of the Committee by accepting the spirit of it and putting it in that better form.</p>
	<p>But we are entitled to object to the fact that yesterday afternoon the Secretary of State issued a release to the press. We have not seen it. It has not been put on the table. We learnt about it from this morning's newspapers. That is not the way to treat the Committee. It seems to be treating the Committee as though it were some inescapable but tedious ritual with all the important decisions being taken offstage elsewhere, not involving the members of the Committee.</p>
	<p>As I said earlier in the Committee's proceedings, this is not the way to treat an important Committee of Parliament and Parliament itself.</p>

As for the second point of order raised by the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker), I am sorry if he thinks that there was any discourtesy to the Committee. It does not seem to me the least bit unreasonable that the Government, having put down a new clause, should seek to publicise what they have done. That is a perfectly proper and usual practice, and I am glad that I

have been able to respond to the wishes both of the Committee in the new clause tabled by the Opposition and of the all-party committee which discussed this in the House.

	<br><blockquote><p>(5) Any person or persons who are in breach of subsection (4) above shall be guilty of undue influence at the scene of an industrial dispute and shall be liable to a fine not exceeding 	<i>£1,000.".</i></p></blockquote>
The starting point for clause 14 is that it is accepted by all members of the Committee that picketing is a legitimate right and that it should be organised on the basis of what is lawful, as contained in the provisions of clause 14. But clause 14 does not define the position of unlicensed pickets, as they have been called—those who turn up on picket lines either to demonstrate or to assemble but who should not be there at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two conditions are necessary when picketing takes place. One is that there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1309">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1503</span>
should be absolute public order in the vicinity. By "vicinity", I mean within either eyeshot or earshot of those who are picketing or who are being picketed. I do not see how it is possible to persuade somebody to a point of view unless there is absolute peace and quiet in the vicinity. That is the reason for this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is quite unnecessary to argue why tranquillity is necessary. The ingredients of any form of peaceful persuasion are, first, that one must catch someone's attention and, secondly, that one must be listened to. One may need to be ingratiating or convincing. At any rate, if one is to be successful, one has to narrow the gap between oneself and the person with whom one is arguing. Salesmanship of a sort, argument or facts must be part of the trading between the two parties. None of this can be done unless there is a tranquil atmosphere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment seeks to ensure that the scene of an industrial dispute where picketing is taking place is congenial and that there is a calm atmosphere. Superfluous people who have no business there for picketing purposes—passers-by, or people going in and out of the place of work—should be excluded from the scene. In short, the area should be anaesthetised and kept trouble-free.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I compare this situation and my proposal with the situation already enshrined in the Representation of the People Acts which provide that when a polling station is open on polling day, it is an offence to use what is described as undue influence. That is why on polling day loudspeakers do not operate within the vicinity of a polling station—within earshot or eyeshot—for fear of creating undue influence on those exercising their right to vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just as we do not permit demonstration or assembly on those occasions, in the sensitive and delicate atmosphere of an industrial dispute we should keep people who are exercising an undeniable right of assembly or demonstration from doing so on that occasion. The amendment seeks to suspend the right of assembly _or demonstration in certain specific situations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At an earlier stage in our proceedings, on 20 March. I intervened when the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) was speaking to ask him, in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1504</span>
event of a conflict between the right to picket and the right to demonstrate, which of those two rights he would prefer to see abandoned. But he did not accept that there was a conflict. I cannot accept that he was right. I 'believe that in order to establish one right it is legitimate to suspend another. It is legitimate, necessary and with precedent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are objections. One is that this is a public order matter which, if there is to be legislation, should come under the supervision of the Home Office. My answer is simply that the climate for picketing goes beyond public order. There is not necessarily public disorder when undue influence is exercised. The Bill should contain a provision about the need for tranquillity on the scene of an industrial dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly it may be objected that there is no place in the Bill for criminal sanctions and that, if there are to be sanctions, they should be civil ones. My answer to that is twofold. First, sanctions are levied in the Bill. There are criminal sanctions. At our twenty-fifth sitting, the Attorney-General said that the court would have the remedy of fines open to it, saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It will only be, as I see it … where pickets have persistently refused to obey the orders of a court that imprisonment becomes a last resort. There would be fines in the first place."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 18 March 1980; c. 1356.]</p></blockquote>
There will be fines in the first place if an injunction is resisted. There will he fines under this provision if the provisions are resisted. But my second point is that the sanctions will operate not against those who are lawfully picketing and who have the immunities granted by the clause, but against extraneous people, many of whom may not be trade unionists. At Grunwick, many trade unionists exercised the right to demonstrate. But many were there only for political purposes—the Socialist Workers' Party and many other extreme groups with nothing whatever to do with the trade union movement. It is people of that sort with whom the amendment is concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not yet made any reference to the fact that his amendment would reduce to one the number of lawful pickets at any one point. I wonder whether he misunderstands his own
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1310">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1505</span>
amendment, since he has not spoken to that point. Quite clearly, once one lawful attender is in position, any other attenders would be unlawful because the amendment states that at that point:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it shall be unlawful for any other person or persons to assemble or demonstrate within the view or the hearing of any person lawfully attending …"</p></blockquote>
That cuts out the possibility of two persons attending lawfuliy. Is that what the hon. Gentleman intends?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am sorry. The hon. Gentleman has misunderstood if not my language at any rate my purpose. I concede that all those for whom it is lawful to be there to picket at their own place of work may be there in accordance with the practice and the codes that were laid down. We are addressing ourselves in this amendment to all those who do not come within that category. If the wording is deficient, as long as the principle is accepted, I see no difficulty in changing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the question of practicality and the objections to it, it may be thought that this is involving the police, and therefore the question arises whether the police wish to have to handle a measure of this sort. It is quite clear from my private conversations with the police and some of their organisations that they are in agreement at least to the extent that they want to see that the number of persons attending the scene of a dispute are not so many as to cause intimidation of any person by their physical presence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the advantages of this amendment will be four- or five-fold. It will provide a proper climate for persuasion to take place. It will deny a focus for those whose only intention is to provide aggravation or violent intimidation. It will keep extremists away. It will diminish, if it does not eliminate altogether, all forms of intimidation, whether gross or of the mild sort which I call undue influence and, finally, it will of course help to avoid, or if not to avoid to make controllable, any unpremeditated eruptions that might suddenly take place if—and I use the word in quotes—anything " provocative " happened on the picket lines which could not have been foreseen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must get the equation right. Leaving aside the argument that we have just had about
	<span class='label label-info column'>1506</span>
whether the provisions relating to those who are lawfully picketing are correct, it needs two elements. The first element is who can be at- the scene of an industrial dispute and that, for the purposes of this argument, is not in dispute. Secondly, it needs to address itself to who cannot be there. I believe that the Government in this clause have only tackled the first of these elements, and to that extent clause 14 is a half-baked measure if it stands as it is at the moment and does not have this amendment added to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) is in a minority of one on this Committee, I suspect that we should take what he says seriously because I doubt whether he is in a minority of one in the Conservative Party. I notice that whenever two or three Conservatives gather together, especially at the seaside, some shrill strident harridan will mount the rostrum and demand swingeing powers against the trade unions. I have made a note of the hon. Gentleman's words that the Government be "armed with effective powers". That is the important thing. We have to ask what is meant by "effective powers". He graciously said that he did not want to destroy trade unions. He just wanted them pummelled and harassed; he wanted the Government to have effective powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hendon, North said that he wanted criminal sanctions and fines of up to £1,000, and this could well mean prosecuting large numbers of men. As we are not having a clause stand part debate, I should like to refer briefly to an occasion in British history when the Government certainly had what they thought were effective powers, and sought to prosecute large numbers of men. They bore out the doubts of the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) and proved that when a Government tried to do that, it did not work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This was the famous case of the Kent miners in 1941 when the Government certainly had very effective powers in theory. The hon. Member for Hendon, North can read the evidence of Sir Harold Emmerson, who was a distinguished senior official at the then Ministry of Labour. It was given in an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1311">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1507</span>
appendix to the Donovan report. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Doubts about the practicability of prosecuting large numbers of men … were put to the test at the Betteshanger Colliery, in Kent, in … 1941."</p></blockquote>
There had been trouble about the allowances to be paid on a particular seam. There had been arbitration, but the men never accepted it and 4,000 of them went on strike. That was then illegal. So what was to be done about it? Against the advice of officials, the Department of Mines decided on a prosecution. Instead of prosecuting the 4,000, it was decided to prosecute the 1,000 underground workers, because 4,000 was too tall an order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Extra supplies of forms for the serving of summonses were rushed down to the Chief Constable of Kent. Then several Justices of the Peace had to be found who were willing to sign 1,000 forms in duplicate, and extra police were drafted to serve them. After these preliminaries a special hearing was arranged. Charges against 1,000 persons could only be handled satisfactorily if the men pleaded guilty. If each man had pleaded "not guilty" the proceedings might have lasted for months. The union was asked to instruct its members to plead guilty and accept a decision on a few test cases. The union obligingly did so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The magistrates met in Canterbury. The news had spread to other coalfields and colliery bands decided to accompany the culprits. Local colliery workers made it an outing for their families and chartered coaches to take wives and children. The Mines Department authorised the regional petroleum officer to allow petrol for the journeys.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the day a festive atmosphere prevailed. Bands played and women and children cheered as the procession went on its way to court. In court the natural British sense of being orderly prevailed. Everything went smoothly and everybody, on the instructions of the union and at the request of the prosecutors, pleaded guilty. The hon. Member for Hendon, North will be delighted to hear that the three union officials were sent to prison. That is an effective power—sending them to prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The branch secretary was sentenced to two months with hard labour; the local president and a member of the local
	<span class='label label-info column'>1508</span>
executive each received one month with hard labour. Thirty-five men were fined £3 or sentenced to one month's imprisonment, and nearly 1,000 were fined £1, or sentenced to 14 days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were many protests. Many of the miners were in the Home Guard. People wondered whether this was the way to treat British citizens. There was talk of sympathetic strikes. But the nub of the question was that the only men who could call off the strike were in gaol. And so the strike went on. Eventually the Secretary for Mines had to go inside the prison to negotiate an end to the strike. The result, with a little dressing up of words here and there, was that the men got everything that they asked for. The men who were in prison for three months had to be let out, because their colleagues would not start work until they were freed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ministry officials said that there was "gloom and apprehension" in the Ministry. Certainly it had been shown that it was possible to prosecute on a large scale if everyone co-operated. But even if remissions were necessary for work to start, they were bound to weaken the authority of the Order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It had then to be decided what to do about the 1,000 men who had been fined £1. The County gaol could only accommodate a few at a time. We were not like Chile. We could not employ tactics such as using Wembley stadium, and it would have taken several years to have imprisoned them all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The officials said that they would not collect the fines. The fines have not been collected to this day. The whole affair collapsed in farce and ignominy. That would be the effect of any attempt to carry out the sort of effective power that the hon. Member for Hendon, North wants. It has been tried in the past, it does not work, and I am certain that if the Government tried to introduce these criminal sanctions, there would be the same effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last time we saw anything like this was in the case of the dockers. We know we had to have the Official Solicitor to get the Government off the hook. I am certain that the Secretary of State understands the matter. He has learnt the lesson and I hope that the hon. Member for Hendon, North will learn it too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1509</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) rightly began his speech by saying that it is common ground that within the confines of civil law there should be a right to picket. He also said that in questions of demonstrations, the numbers of people present at the site of a picket line, is essentially a matter for public order. That is true. It is important to bear in mind that the Home Secretary announced on 27 June last year that he would be reviewing the Public Order Act 1936 and related legislation. That review is concerned with all aspects of public order arising out of demonstrations, marches, processions, and so forth. My right hon. Friend has recently announced that he hopes to be able to publish a Green Paper in April which will provide a basis for consultation on the complex issues involved in public order legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the substance of the amendment is essentially a matter for public order. We must bear in mind, too, that clause 14 as it stands will enable an employer to seek an injunction against anybody other than lawful pickets who claim to be demonstrating, but who are actually inducing breaches of contract. The question whether an assembly is of pickets or genuine demonstrators is one of fact—whether those present are inducing breaches of contract. In practice, secondary pickets could not be disguised as demonstrators so as to assist in picketing, without being outside the new definition of lawful picketing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who induced a breach of contract while attending other than his own place of work would be committing a fraud and an injunction could be sought against him. The amendment is therefore relevant only to genuine demonstrations, such as those directed against the pickets themselves, for example, by the wives of the Sheerness steel workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my hon. Friend whether he would actually wish to preclude the possibility of a demonstration such as we saw carried out by the wives of steel workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that he says, primarily, that the motive for this amendment is to establish a 	<i>cordon sanitaire.</i> I wonder, whether, on reflection, he considers it right not only to preclude but to make a criminal
	<span class='label label-info column'>1510</span>
offence, supported by the sanction of a maximum fine of £1,000, the presence of those who are affected in their locality by a picket line established by people with no local connection who are seeking to bring to an end the livelihood of, for example, husbands and bring serious economic loss to the community. Is it really right to make a criminal out of those who wish to go along and express their opinions in that way? I believe we should listen and hesitate a very long time before we take that road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. and learned Friend takes that view, how is it that he presumably supports the existence of the Representation of the People Acts which prevent people doing the same sort of thing at a polling station?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the Representation of the People Acts is to prevent people from being frightened when going to vote. Many people would be frightened when going in to vote if they were to be subjected to political demonstrations at the scene. I do not particularly mind if pickets are frightened from picketing, if people such as the wives of the Sheerness steel workers are free to express their opinions. I do not think that that is a very persuasive analogy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is a distinguished member of the Select Committee. I believe it to be the case at a recent hearing that the Chief Constable attending the Select Committee did not support a proposal in the broad terms of the amendment. It was against trying to disperse pickets before they reach the scene to prevent them making policing worse. The specific suggestion of the 	<i>cordon sanitaire</i> was put to him, and the Metropolitan Police commissioner said in effect that it could cause great frustration to keep people on the outside and that the police have got into great difficulties by trying to push people. The people are kept near enough to the scene so that they can at least see the objective. I do not pretend to have quoted that verbatim but I understand that he was opposed to the suggestion that was put by my hon. Friend, and I believe that the amendment would impose very considerable burdens upon the police at the risk of greatly exacer-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1313">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1511</span>
bating tension at the site of an industrial dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quite understand, and share, my hon. Friend's view that tranquillity and the absence of disorder are very important on these occasions. I believe that the existing law—possibly to be strengthened as a result of the Home Secretary's review to which I have already referred—will provide the means of keeping public order in these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also think that the code of practice that my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, will publish about the conduct of picket lines may also be of help. Therefore, much as I sympathise with the objective of my hon. Friend in seeking to secure a peaceful climate at the scene of an industrial dispute, I must advise my right hon. and hon. Friends to resist this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 176, in page 14, line 36, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and in this subsection ' contract ' means a contract existing at the time of the act done in respect of which liability is alleged".</p></blockquote>
I welcome the Solicitor-General to our proceedings. He is just in time to save the Secretary of State for Employment from answering this amendment which, I say somewhat shamefully, is legal and erudite, and which I shall not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1314">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1513</span>
eventually press. That will save the Solicitor-General from worrying too much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of clause 15 is that, where members of a union induce employees working in a different place or for a different employer to join the union by breaching or interfering with contracts, or threatening to interfere with contracts, they will lose the immunity from court action previously afforded by section 13 of the 1974 Act. As the Solicitor-General knows, the Court of Appeal, presided over by Lord Denning, held in the case of Torquay Hotel Ltd. v. Cousins that even where a contract did not exist, a threat to interfere with it should be unlawful. In that case, the Court of Appeal held that, even though the hotel had in fact no contract with a fuel supplier called Alternative Fuels Limited, the unions had threatened to black that fuel if such a contract was met. So in the context of the clause, a threat that workers would not be employed or that contracts as yet not concluded with customers or suppliers would be interfered with would be covered by the clause as it now stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to obviate that eventuality. The amendment would allow negotiations and, in the course of negotiations, the blacking of an employer who said that he intended to employ non-union labour even though he had not yet concluded a contract to do so. In these circumstances, union members would be at great risk from action for damages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that it is a very limited amendment. It follows from Torquay Hotel Limited v. Cousins, and I do not think that I need to expand on it at this stage. It would be impossible for me on such a narrow amendment to go into the merits of the clause. It is a probing amendment, and I should be grateful to hear what the Solicitor-General has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I am not out of order, Mr. Leadbitter, in drawing attention to the difficulty in which we have been in tabling amendments to this clause because of its structure. It seems to me—I was tempted to use a vulgarism but I shall not—that it is upside-down, about face.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1514</span>
We had to reach subsection (2) to find out what the clause was all about. We have difficulty in tabling and discussing amendments to subsection (1) which I think cannot be understood properly unless we can understand the clause as a whole. I am very glad that the Solicitor-General, whose presence we warmly welcome, is indicating his understanding of the point that I am making, and I hope that that means that he will seek to explain the way the clause is intended to work. May I ask the Solicitor-General whether I have understood the clause correctly? The Government have told us what the clause is intended to do. Whether it has that effect or whether we think it ought to have that effect is another matter. But it seems to me that the Government are saying that if the chaps who work, let us say, on a newspaper in Fleet Street refuse to handle work that is coming in from an art studio or photo reproduction house outside—work that has not been produced by trade union labour—because they want the workers at the generating point to be members of their union, that on enactment will be unlawful in future, the immunity which at present exists will be forfeited and section 13 of the 1974 Act will not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that puzzles me is who will be in a position to seek the remedy for what is then an unlawful act? Will it be the employer at the point where the material is generated—the art studio, the advertising agency or the photo reproduction house? It seems to me that if there is an argument that there is an injured party, he will be the injured party. My reading and understanding of the clause is that it is the employer of the workers who are refusing to handle the work, the employer who can get his work done elsewhere if his employees refuse to handle it from the disputed source. It seems to me that in those circumstances the person to whom a remedy is given would be unlikely to use it because he would be able to get his remedy merely by placing the work elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apparently the Solicitor-General disagrees. I have explained some of the difficulty in which we find ourselves, and I shall be quite happy to listen to the hon. and learned Gentleman's response to the points made by my hon. and learned Friend and by myself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Members for the welcome extended to me last Thursday and again today. I am pleased to come to the Committee, and my pleasure is the greater for finding on both sides survivors of the Committee stage of the 1974 Trade Union and Labour Relations Bill. It makes it quite like old times. But I noticed one difference last Thursday. I was trying to remember whether there had been any other occasion when I had sat still for more than an hour in a Committee discussing trade union matters without opening my mouth. I could not think of any other instance. But now I have the chance to make my first contribution, and I welcome it. There is still one big difference. Hon. Members who were on that Committee will know that I was in the thick of the arguments about policy.

Today, as I know all hon. and right hon. Members will understand, my purpose is to assist with the law, and I do not need to assure the Committee I shall do everything I can to assist with the law. Questions of policy I shall leave to my right hon. and hon. Friends.

The Secretary of State and I thought yesterday—and I also had a word with one hon. Member of the Opposition—that it may be convenient if, right at the outset of the discussion on this clause, I try to set the scene by going slowly through the clause and saying how it works in law, in the hope that people may then be able to test their own examples by applying the tests that I shall try to outline. Some may already know all of this. If they do, I must ask them to be patient because it would not serve much purpose if I rattled through it. I must take the three stages, not at great length but reasonably slowly so that it is all understood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quite understand that if one reads this clause in isolation, it is not merely difficult to follow it; it is quite impossible to understand it or the effect of it except in the proper context. I hope to persuade the Committee that, considered in the proper context, it is not difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the proper context? The clause has no relevance at all except in the context of litigation—one party bringing an action in the courts against another. More particularly than that, it
	<span class='label label-info column'>1516</span>
has no relevance at all save in an action where the party claiming has a claim which would be actionable at law on one of the grounds specified in paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) or (	<i>b</i>) of section 13(1)—of which I shall remind the Committee in a moment—but which is prevented from being actionable by the provisions of section 13 because the act in question was done in contemplation of furtherance of a trade dispute. That is the background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn immediately to the point made by the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker). It is important to remember that this section does not give anybody any remedies. Before ever one gets to the effect of the new clause, there has to be the basic situation that I have outlined. There has to be a plaintiff who has a right of action at common law, a right of action based on one of the grounds specified in paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>) of section 13(1). Without that, the relevant sequence of events never gets started and one never reaches the stage of considering what the effect clause 15 would have if relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the second stage is the fact that the clause is still irrelevant. In answer to the plaintiff's claim the defendant says "Yes, I did it. But I did it in contemplation of furtherance of a trade dispute. Therefore I may claim the immunity accorded to me by section 13." It is only where those two stages exist that one arrives at the third stage, i.e. a consideration of what this clause does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to take the Committee through those three stages in simple terms. Stage one, as I indicated, consists of someone whom I shall call A bringing an action. It could be a defendant counter-claiming in an action, but for the purpose of simplicity let us talk only about a plaintiff. So the plaintiff A is claiming against the defendant, whom I shall call B, on one of the grounds specified in subsections (1)(	<i>a</i>) or (	<i>b</i>) of section 13, that is to say that he either induced another person to break a contract or interfered or induced another person to interfere with its performance, or threatened that a contract, whether one to which he was a party or not, would be broken or have its performance interfered with, or that he would induce another person to break a contract or to interfere with its performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1316">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1517</span>
We must assume that there is a right of action given to the plaintiff under common law, and we have the plaintiff bringing an action to sue the defendant, on one of those grounds. It is useful to notice that for the purpose of claiming he will be referring to a specific existing contract, because his action has to be brought on one of those grounds. That is important, because it means the writ itself will show what is the contract with which the court is concerned. Hon. Members will realise that later in the clause appears the phrase "the contract concerned". That is what "the contract concerned" is—the contract in respect of which the action is being brought on one of those grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Stage two is that the defendant receives that statement of claim and decides on his answer. He may say "I did not do that". That would be one defence. Or he may say "Even if I did do it, it does not give the plaintiff cause of action at common law". That would be another defence. Or he may say "Yes I did it, but even so and even if it does give the plaintiff a right of action at common law, in fact I did this in contemplation of furtherance of a trade dispute, and therefore section 13 gives me immunity "—another defence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he makes no such claim, the action proceeds according to common law and this clause does not come into consideration at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the defendant makes such a claim, but fails to show either that there was a trade dispute, or that what he did was in contemplation of furtherance of that trade dispute, again the section 13 defence fails, and the parties never have to consider the effect of this clause. But if in such circumstances B can show that what he did, he did in contemplation of furtherance of a trade dispute, or in the case of interlocutory proceedings for an injunction where the issue will not be finally decided he can establish that it is likely that he will satisfy the court that what he did was done in contemplation of furtherance of a trade dispute prima facie that will give him a defence. It will enable him to claim the immunity given to industrial action under section 13. It will be the end of the action unless A can point to some other provisions of law which would assist A, and enable him to continue with his action notwithstanding Section
	<span class='label label-info column'>1518</span>
13. It is only at that point, and if the action reaches that point, that the new clause would come into operation or have any relevance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come therefore to stage three. How would one then approach the question of whether A could take advantage of these provisions in that situation? A and his advisers would have to look at the clause and ask themselves, "What are the things that we have to establish before we can take advantage of the clause? "While I understand the point of the right hon. Member for Doncaster, as to possible first impressions, I hope that I shall be able to satisfy the Committee that the structure is in fact such that the party considering whether he can take advantage of the new clause and his lawyers are assisted as much as the structure of a clause could possibly assist anyone in answering that question. This structure was chosen to enable the practising lawyer to sit down with his client and answer the question, "What do we have to establish in order to take advantage of the clause?"—and the attraction of the method chosen is that one can reduce the requirements of the clause to a sort of check-list of tests or questions, tests which are all questions of fact—and I would stress this to the Committee—rather than matters of judgment, opinion or interpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I illustrate that by running through the clause as I see a lawyer advising his client running through it with him. I say no more about the opening three lines. They are part of the background that I have explained to the Committee. If the provisions of those three lines were not satisfied, none of the rest of this would arise. So let us assume that they are satisfied and turn to the first question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first question that a lawyer would have to answer arises on subsection (1) (	<i>a</i>). "Is the contract concerned a contract of employment?" He might, if he had not considered it as far as we have, ask himself what the "contract concerned" was. But I hope that I have already assisted the Committee on that. The contract concerned or referred to as the "contract concerned" is the contract in respect of which the action is being brought. There is no difficulty in identifying it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second question is whether that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1317">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1519</span>
is a contract of employment. That is a pure question of fact and there is no difficulty about it. Either it is or it is not. So answering the first question would be easy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, after considering the points that I have just put, one can say, " Yes, the contract concerned is a contract of employment", the requirements of subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>) are satisfied and it is not necessary to look at (1)(	<i>b</i>). If the answer is, "No, the contract concerned is not a contract of employment", one simply goes to the next questions on the checklist, which arise under paragraph (	<i>b</i>). What one would be asking oneself there is obvious. It would be, " Is one of the facts relied upon for the purpose of establishing liability that any person has:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(i) induced another to break a contract of employment or interfered or induced another to interfere with its performance"</p></blockquote>
or threatened to do so as under paragraph (ii)?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no difficulty for the plaintiff in answering those questions. He is the person bringing the action and he knows best of all on what facts he will rely. If the answer to that question is " No", one of the facts relied upon is not either what is said in sub-paragraph (i) or subparagraph (ii)—end of question. So if we have a "No" to both (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>)—end of question. The lawyer will say to his client, "I'm sorry, but you have not got through the first two gateways so you cannot rely upon this section".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he has got through those gates, he passes on to subsection (2) and there are two questions of fact that arise under subsection (2). The first is, Was the act done for the purpose of compelling workers to become members
	<br><blockquote><p>"of a particular trade union or of one of two or more particular trade unions"?</p></blockquote>
—a question of fact. If the answer is "No", again the lawyer says, " Sorry, Mr. So-and-so, but you cannot take advantage of these provisions ". If the answer to that question is "Yes" there is still one other question that has to be asked, and that is the question contained in the last half of that sentence: Did any of those workers work
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the same employer or at the same place as the employee working under the contract of employment referred to in subsection (1) above"?.</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1520</span>
Again, dependent on the answer to that will be the final view expressed by counsel as to whether the employer who will be seeking to rely upon these provisions can rely upon them. The format enables one to write out a check list of questions and go through them and, dependent on the answer to each one of them, arrive at a conclusion. It is easier to do it on a piece of paper than to do it as I am doing it, but I hope that I have demonstrated sufficiently what the approach has to be and how simple it really is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have now been through all the stages of the action to try to set the complete scene. It is easy enough for lawyers who practise in these fields to see the whole picture, but I have done this because there is no reason why anybody except a lawyer who has practised in these fields should be able to see the whole picture unless someone first sets the scene. In practice, one would not necessarily have to go through the whole of that palaver because when an employer was asking for advice as to whether he could rely on this section one could for that purpose assume stage 1 and stage 2. What he would want to know from his lawyers would be: "Let us assume that I have a cause of action, but let us assume that the defendant would be entitled to rely upon the benefit of section 13 unless we can get within the provisions of this clause ". That would be the practical situation. He and his lawyers would then go through the four questions that I have put and, depending on the answer to those questions, which are all questions of fact, the lawyer would be able to say, " Yes, in my opinion you may take advantage of these provisions "—and if one may, of course, the effect is to remove the immunity, but everybody knows that. Having taken the employer through the questions, if the lawyer is able to say, " Well, now, you can get through all the gateways", he will be able to say that the employer can rely on the clause as an answer to a section 13 defence. If, on the other hand, the effect of the answers to those questions is that he failed to get through any one of the gateways, the advice would be "No, these provisions are of no avail to you. If the defendant has a defence under section 13 you have no answer to that".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1318">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1521</span>
Of course, all this is technical, because we are dealing with a technical subject. It is unavoidable. It cannot be avoided any more than it can be avoided in so many other operations—engineering, surgery, a complicated piece of music, flying an aeroplane. But I suggest to the Committee that the attraction of the method adopted in this case is, as I have indicated, that it enables one to simplify to a quite remarkable degree what has to be done in order to see whether the clause applies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That exercise, determining whether or not a party can take advantage of the clause, can be reduced to answering seriatim a list of questions all of which are questions of fact. I stress "questions of fact" rather than opinion, judgment or interpretation because very often what we lawyers are called upon to do in advising whether or not a provision will apply is to forecast how the trial judge or the court of appeal or even later the House of Lords will interpret certain general terms. We have kept that out here. These are questions of fact. Go through the list of questions, answer those questions of fact, and the answers to those questions will give you the answer to the fundamental question "Can the employer pray in aid the provisions of this clause?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am greatly obliged to right hon. and hon. Members for the patience with which they have heard me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am obliged to them for hearing me through because, at the end of the day if we are all to get the right picture in our minds, we must see it as a whole. So it would have been that much more difficult had hon. Members felt that they had to raise their queries on the way along. I hope that that first run-over of the complete picture will be of some assistance and that after I have answered the specific questions of right hon. and hon. Members it may be of more assistance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that we are all grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for running through clause 15 which quite frankly I find utterly incomprehensible. It is no criticism of the Solicitor-General to say that I will need to read his words because, not being a lawyer, I have not been able to grasp
	<span class='label label-info column'>1522</span>
at first hand all that he has said this morning. I accept that the fault is probably mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to pose a question to the hon. and learned Gentleman. Clause 15 has been called the SLADE clause. Whether that is the correct term for the clause I leave to other people to judge, but I do not think that it is. I think, doing the best that I possibly can to interpret and accept the words of the Solicitor-General, that clause 15 seeks to put on to the statute book a piece of legislation which will stop action being taken to force other people into a trade union. That leads me to my question. As I understand it, the purpose of clause 15 would be so that in any situation where one group of workers takes action against another group of workers to force them into their union, the second employer would be able to apply to the courts under clause 15 for an injunction to take legal action against them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to avoid any reference to the printing industry because I know very little about it. Instead, I refer the Solicitor-General to my industry, the engineering and shipbuilding industry. If we had a situation where, for instance, the machinists belonging to the AUEW in a machine shop discovered that the castings coming in from another firm were coming from a non-union shop and the AUEW members in the machine shop blacked the work, would I be right in assuming that the employer of the non-union labour would not be able to use clause 15 so long as the workers in the machine shop were not insisting that the non-union workers joined the AUEW?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the clause apply only if the machine shop workers said that they would not touch the castings until such time as those individuals joined the AUEW? As I understand the matter, that would allow the second employer to bring in clause 15. If the AUEW machinists simply said " We will not touch those castings because they are coming from non-union labour " and left the matter there, without any regard to whether the workers joined the AUEW, what would then be the situation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Solicitor-General says that he has spelt it out, that it was a question of fact, and has given us a check-lis' But in the situations which arise on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1319">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1523</span>
shop floor, in paint works, steel works, shipyards and so on, workers do not go along to see a solicitor or a barrister to ask about it. Actions arise virtually spontaneously. I know that the Solicitor-General's task is to interpret the law and not to interpret the policy or wisdom lying behind it. It is up to the Secretary of State to defend the practicality and policy behind the Bill. But I suggest that it is important, in the context of clause 15, for us to be informed whether, in the kind of case I outlined, the employer of the non-union labour could take action against the workers in the first establishment for simply saying "We will not touch that work because it comes from non-union labour" I should be grateful if the Solicitor-General could interpret the law in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be for the convenience of the Committee, as technical points are apt to be brought up, for the Solicitor-General to respond after each question, unless the hon. and learned Gentleman would prefer to wait?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to the Solicitor-General for seeking to explain what he is the first to acknowledge is an extremely complex clause. I do not blame the hon. and learned Gentleman, but myself, that after his explanation I am not much more clear. I do not think that the hon. and learned Gentleman would expect me, lacking legal training, and perhaps even those who possess such training, to understand the full sense of what he said. But we now have the matter on record and we shall be able to study it and discuss it, so that at least we may understand the mechanism of the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With respect, when the Solicitor- General was speaking I was reminded of when I was learning to be an aero-engine fitter. I saw one of those enormously complex aero-engines and thought that I should never understand how it worked. My instructor took a great metal casing off the front and said "I shall show you how it works" and started to explain all the bewildering array of cogs, pistons, valves, and so on. I was more overwhelmed when the back had been removed from the mechanism and I had seen the thing in its entirety. But the Solicitor-General has taken the back off the watch, so to speak, and told us how the wheels work. We shall study that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1524</span>
The hon. and learned Gentleman, having told us how it will work, has not told us why the provision is these, and where and when it will apply. That is what we need to know. This was the point of the example given by my hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Evans). I have no doubt that we shall seek to give more examples, because my hon. Friend's point, and the point we shall want to make, is that as on so many occasions Governments, having identified a particular situation that they feel ought to be the subject of legislative action, ignore the fact that it will have consequential effects—probably harmful—on a number of other situations which they never envisaged. In this case I believe that they will be harmful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General may feel that it is not for him to deal with matters that are the policy substance of the clause—its, purposes—and that that duty is perhaps more appropriate to the Secretary of State. If he were to say that we should entirely understand, so long as a Minister dealt with those points when we raised them. But we ought to make it clear to the Solicitor-General at this stage that, while we are grateful for what he has said so far as it goes and we shall study it with care, it only touches upon the area of explanation that the clause requires.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General made it quite clear that he has come to the Committee to give advice on the legal interpretation of the clause, and not to enter into the politics of the matter or the reasons why the clause is there. That is another question, as the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) has also indicated, which the Secretary of State and his colleagues in the Committee would seek to answer. That being the case, it might be worth while to proceed on the basis that the Solicitor-General, who is giving legal advice, could respond to each point that is raised so that no Member has his point lost. If hon. Members put their points one after another and leave the hon. and learned Gentleman to wind up, that might satisfy him. If the Committee could indicate that that might be the best way to proceed, we could get on with the interpretation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. and learned Gentleman listens to my advice, he may feel that the Committee could proceed upon it. I feel that, at this stage, although we are talking about his amendment, the Solicitor-General is confining himself to a legal interpretation, so that the Committee can be informed about the legal consequences of the clause. When the Solicitor-General has exhausted his advice, to the satisfaction of the Committee, the Committee can proceed with the political concepts and other matters related to the clause for which the Secretary of State is more directly answerable. That seems to be the position and that is why the Solicitor-General has come before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short question which I should like the Solicitor-General to answer comes entirely within the terms which you have just outlined, Mr. Lead-bitter. I should be grateful if the Solicitor-General, with his great experience in the law, would comment on the word "compel". As far as I know it is unprecedented in the Bill. We understand and have referred in the past to words such as "induce", "persuade" and "encourage", but rarely does the word "compel" appear in any statute. It is an absolute. It is in no way relevant. Compulsion is compulsion. There are no degrees of compulsion. I should like to hear his comments on the use of the word in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In circumstances in which all the defences and immunities have disappeared, the way forward for the plaintiff is wide open. He has to be able to convince the court that the act which was done, was admitted to have been done and is admittedly not covered by any form of immunity, was done for the purpose of compelling workers to become members of a union, not for the purpose of persuading, encouraging or inducing them. I cannot conceive of any circumstances in which anyone can be compelled in an absolute sense to become a member of a trade union. The only body which could compel is this House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are circumstances in which it would clearly be in the workers' interests to join a trade union—they might otherwise lose their jobs. But the choice is still there. It is still open for them to join a trade
	<span class='label label-info column'>1526</span>
union. There are other choices. Pressure may be very strong indeed on a person in certain circumstances to join a trade union. Therefore, I welcome the Solicitor-General's view on how the courts could interpret the word "compel" and whether he disagrees with my view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentlemen for the kind things they have said. I do not take in the least amiss the fact that it is still largely incomprehensible. The right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) put his finger on it. What I have tried to do is put something on record which people can now look at. I would think it a miracle if one could, in one run-through on one's feet, make the whole thing crystal clear to everybody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) put a specific case. He did not, however, ask himself the first relevant question, which would be "Who have a right of action in the circumstances postulated?" None of this has any relevance unless someone has a right of action and is bringing an action in the courts. I should like also to pick up another observation he made. He said that people do not run along to see barristers every time. Of course they do not. [	<i>Interruption</i>]. Well, it may be. I do not know, actually, that the trade unions are those least able to afford anything at the moment, but I will not get into that field. Of course, people do not rush off to see their lawyers in this or any other field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I, or any other Law Officer, come to be asked questions. we are often told we are not being practical when in fact it may possibly be that the questions being put to us are not really practical questions. They are not questions that will arise once in a blue moon. But of course I must do my best to answer them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wholly endorse what the hon. Gentleman said that the sort of detailed questions we are talking about now probably do not arise once in a blue moon. They do arise however where one gets a situation like that in SLADE where a particular course of action is devised and sustained for a particular purpose—I am not concerned with the rights or wrongs of it—there is an identifiable course of action. I was asked "Why this clause?". I am not trespassing too far outside my field in saying that it is tailor-made to meet that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1321">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1527</span>
type of situation. That is my first comment on the question put to me by the hon. Member for Newton. It does not follow that anybody would be suing in the circumstances that he put to me. Probably it is only in very rare cases that anybody is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until the plaintiff is identified, one cannot go through the check-list of items that arise under this clause. First, one must ask who is suing and in respect of what contract is he suing—because that is the "contract concerned". Next I come to the specific question he put to me related to the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"a particular trade union or one of two or more particular trade unions".</p></blockquote>
He gave a number of examples. If the union was saying "You have to join SLADE", then clearly that would come within the wording of the clause. If the union were saying, "You must join SLADE, the NGA or SOGAT", my advice would be that that would come within the wording of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But if there was the sort of situation—of 78which I am well aware as I spent months on that other Committee and have been concerned in the practical rather than the legal aspects of this for years—where there is union and non-union labour working on one site side by side and the union members say, "We are walking off unless the other people join a union. We do not mind what union it is but we will not work with nonunion labour". Clearly, that is not caught by the clause. The clause even includes the words in subsection (2).
	<br><blockquote><p>"or at the same place as the employee is working"</p></blockquote>
which relate to the sort of situation where union and non-union labour is working together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman put a specific question to me, giving two examples. In the first, the requirements of the clause would be satisfied. In the second they would not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General said that those people came within the scope of the clause who said that they would not handle work that was being generated elsewhere unless the workers belonged to a particular trade union. The workers who are receiving work from an outside source might say, "That is work which should be done by our members. It is not being done by our members. Therefore, we shall not touch it." In other words, they are saying nothing
	<span class='label label-info column'>1528</span>
about the membership or non-membership of the people who have generated the work; they are merely saying, "That ought to be done by our members. It has not been done by our members. Therefore, we will not touch it'.' Does that fall within the clause? Does that give someone the right of action?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On those basic facts, I would say that it does not fall within the terms of this subsection because the question that has to be asked is whether the act was done for the purpose of compelling workers to become members of a particular trade union. I leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"or of one of two or more"</p></blockquote>
so that I do not keep repeating it. On the hypothesis that the right hon. Gentleman has put to me, that would not be the purpose. That would not be what they were saying. Nor would it be the purpose in the instance which the hon. Gentleman put to me of people working alongside somebody and simply saying that they will not work with non-union labour, because the answer to the question "Was this act done for the purpose of compelling workers to become members of a particular trade union?" would so clearly be "No". So on those hypotheses the answer really would be as simple as that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Doncaster illustrated his point by referring to a complex aero engine. But, of course, however expert he may be, he could not explain to me, on his feet with me sitting down, all the things one has to do to find out what is wrong with the engine, whether it is the spark plug—I do not know whether they have spark plugs any more—or the petrol or whatever. If he is a sensible man even the engineer will not try to carry it all in his head anyway, certainly not until he is very experienced. He would have a checklist, and I bet the first thing that was given to the hon. Member when he was being taught any engineering task was a checklist. He would be told, "You do this first, and if the answer is so-and-so the trouble is so-and-so" etc. In so many of these complex operations that is exactly what the sensible person tries to produce for himself—a check-list. It may be very long, it may be quite short. In this case it is quite short. And this is why this structure is adopted, because it would be a bold man who tried to carry all these complexities in his head at one time.

We have tried to produce—and, I feel, with some degree of success—a stucture enables those who are called upon to advise to go through the check-list, decide questions of fact, and then give their advice.

The right hon. Gentleman asked me why the clause is there and how it works. I shall not step into the other field any more than I can help, but I feel that I can comment on that one. It is tailor-made to meet the SLADE-type situation. That is why it is so restrictive, why there are so many gateways, so that it will not unwittingly gather up other situations such as some of those that have been put to me this morning. That is the why and the how. Some will agree with that as someting that ought to be done; some will not. But what I want to get out of the discussion, because it does not profit anybody, is the idea that it is so fearfully complex that everyone will have great difficulty trying to apply the clause or give advice about it. I assure the Committee that it is not. It has been made as simple as it can be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appologise to the hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) for overlooking the fact that I was speaking after his amendment. As the hon. and learned Gentleman said, his point is a short one. I do not think that I could say more than that I would be happy to discuss the technical details with him if he so wished, but that my advice is that it is not a danger. My advice is that the danger which he suggested might exist is not in fact a real danger. If I thought that it was, I would recommend that additions be made to the clause. But I commend this to the Committee—we do not want to make any additions to it unless a really good case is shown for them. What we have tried to do in conjunction with the Parliamentary counsel in drafting this clause is to make it as simple as possible. The one thing we do not want now is to complicate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) has great knowledge of these matters, and I think that when he looks at this in writing he will find that it is not as difficult as he thinks. If I am disappointed in that and he finds that it is difficult, let us have 10 minutes about it in the Tea Room and we will write out a check-list. I think that most people could write out that check-list for themselves now. But if any body has any difficulty, I am quite prepared to return to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the point of substance raised
	<span class='label label-info column'>1530</span>
by the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther). No, I do not think that the concept of the word "compel" is an absolute concept. I think that it is relative, in the same way as "serious" and "substantial" and "grave" and similar words. He gave some of the others to which the word, compel, is relative. Here we have a collection of relative words: "persuading", "encouraging", "inducing", "compelling". I say with great respect to the hon. Gentleman that just as those of us who are not directly involved in industrial relations may postulate situations which make the experts on that side despair because they say, "Theoretically it could happen but if only the chap was on the shop floor with us he would know that it does not actually happen", there is a danger of the same thing happening the other way round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For years I have been sitting as a judge trying criminal cases of one kind or another. One is constantly, in the course of summing up to a jury, having to deal with relative words like "serious", "substantial", "grave", "grievous", "actual bodily harm" and so on. There are many words like that in respect of which it is not easy to give a precise definition. But one knows perfectly well and one says to the jury, "This is what you must decide: What is 'serious' etc?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that anybody in practice will have any difficulty with the word "compelling". It has appeared in a number of statutes. One of the interesting things is that I cannot find any case in which its meaning has been the subject of judicial dicision. l infer that that is because when somebody is trying to compel someone it is pretty obvious that they have got past persuading or inducing or encouraging and they have passed into the realm of compelling. My definition of "compelling" to distinguish it from those words would be this. To compel somebody to do something is to try to make him do it by putting him in a position where he has no practical alternative. This is the difference between the absolute test which the hon. Gentleman suggests and what I advise the Committee would be the practical test and the tests which the court would apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hear that the hon. Gentleman is not entirely in agreement with that. He might be right, but as I was saying, this is not a word which has ever caused any difficulty in the courts. The usual reason why questions are not the subject of leading
