CONTRIBUTION IN RESPECT OF COMPENSATION</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed</i> [<i>this day</i>], No. 127, in page 11, line 7, after 'indemnity', insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(5) For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that an act done by a trade union or other person for the purpose of persuading an employer to agree to pay a sum of money in consequence of an order under subsection (2) above:
<ol>
<li>shall not by virtue only of this section be regarded as an unlawful act or the use of unlawful means for the purpose of establishing liability in tort; and</li>
<li>shall be regarded as connected with the employment or non-employment of the person who made the original complaint against the employer within the meaning of section 29 of the 1974 Act;</li></ol>
and any such agreement shall not be unlawful by virtue only of the provisions of this section."—[<i>Mr. Arthur Davidson</i>].</p></blockquote></p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had sought to explain the true nature of the action hypothesised by the hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson). The Government accordingly trusted and intended that it would not be held to be protected by immunity from civil action. It is, therefore, out of the question that the Government should accept an amendment declaring that none of the ingredients is present which could defeat a claim to such immunity. It would be the opposite of what we wish the law to be.<br><br>
We trust, however, with some confidence that the courts will look to the substance and not the form of the exercise hypothesised in this amendment in the event of it being tried.<br><br>
The argument under clause 3 which the hon. and learned Gentleman advanced a few sittings ago has not much similarity. A
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1100</span>
strike to secure the dismissal of an employee held to have been unreasonably excluded from a union would not infringe his right not to be unreasonably excluded. Such a strike would not be held to be unlawful and, hence, unprotected by immunity.<br><br>
But it is quite otherwise in the hypothesis put forward today by the hon. and learned Gentleman. The whole purpose there is to infringe in reality the employer's right to receive a contribution from the union. The Government cannot agree, therefore, that the court should be instructed in a declaratory provision that that stratagem is lawful and should be protected.<br><br>
I think it highly unlikely that a union would behave in the manner that is suggested in the amendment. It has that in common with the scenario put forward under clause 3 by the hon. and learned Gentleman. But if it is to be tested we shall observe the outcome with interest and reserve our right to take further legislative action.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for his detailed explanation. Speaking personally, I have a feeling—I hope I am proved wrong—that the joinder provisions of clause 9 will be seldom used. In which case the hon. and learned Gentlemans' argument may well be right. If the joinder provisions are not used, or hardly used, action to defeat them, if I may use that phrase, is similarly unlikely to be used.<br><br>
However, as I informed the hon. and learned Gentleman, this was an exploratory amendment. It has been useful and enabled the hon. and learned Gentleman to go into greater detail about the clause. It is not certainly not my intention to encourage trade unions in any way to act contrary to an order of the court. In the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to delay. the Committee long, but we cannot allow the clause to pass without some comment, not least because the very useful debate we have had so far has revealed a number of interesting and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1093">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1101</span>
perhaps hitherto unrevealed issues lurking within it. It has been like peeling an onion—one strips off one layer to find yet another interesting layer with a different complexion underneath, and I fear that the clause will have similar lachrymose effects.<br><br>
I was surprised that the hon. and learned Gentleman did not take up the interesting point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton). I had not grasped, until, with his perceptiveness, he drew it to the Committee's attention, that notwithstanding that the debate has been conducted on the assumption that the clause has apparently been drafted—the Minister's remarks tended to confirm this—with those who are affected by closed shops or union membership agreements in mind, it will have a much wider application.<br><br>
I do not want to reopen that debate, but one can bring to mind a whole range of situations totally unconnected with closed shops and union membership agreements, perhaps entirely divorced from trade union activity, where nonetheless a defendant before a tribunal may well, having an adverse decision made against him, invoke this clause to shed some of the financial liability that he may otherwise incur.<br><br>
For example, in a preparatory school for young boys—I do not know whether my hon. Friend mentioned such a case—a member of the staff could be identified as having homosexual tendencies. Other members of the staff may make representations to the headmaster, and he thinks "Yes, in the light of these representations this member of the staff must go. I shall find an appropriate pretext—perhaps bad time-keeping." When the dismissal takes place, the aggrieved member of staff puts in an application to the tribunal and when the truth is revealed the headmaster says in defence "Members of the staff made representations to me. I had to dismiss the chap, and they are just as responsible as I am". That has nothing to do with closed shops or trade union activities. It is just one example of the many that every hon. Member could quickly bring to mind.<br><br>
We should make people outside the Committee aware of the possible far-reaching consequences of this part of the Bill. We have all had experience of Parliament legislating to deal with a specific problem and then finding that the remedy prescribed hits situations never envisaged
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1102</span>
in the original proposals.<br><br>
Equally, we have been intrigued to discover that although a trade union, or another person, may well be required to pay the whole or part of any compensation that is awarded by the tribunal, the actual responsibility for making the payment will fall on the employer. It will be for him subsequently to seek to recover the money that he has paid out from the other party or parties who have been joined with him.<br><br>
I am not yet clear, and I rather doubt—in fairness, I must say this—if the Minister is altogether clear, about the interaction between this new provision in the Bill and the existing provisions of section 63 of the 1978 Act. The Minister very fairly promised to look at what had been argued, and at his own reply, to see whether it would have the possible consequences that I feared.<br><br>
I was not present, I regret to say, when the Minister apparently suggested that, because of our amendment No. 126, we appeared to be accepting, in some degree at least, the principle which underlies the clause. In fact, we maintain wholehearted, categorical and absolute opposition to the clause, and I urge my hon. Friends to divide the Committee to reject it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker), I do not intend to detain the Committee long on clause 9. However, it is essential that we have a short debate about it.<br><br>
I offer a brief quotation from today's issue of <i>The Guardian.</i> The headline on page 2 reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"Prior says he'll 'carry the can'".</p></blockquote>
The article continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. James Prior, the Employment Secretary, confessed last night that he would have to carry the can if his 'softly, softly' approach to industrial relations legislation proved to be a failure. But he claimed that the whole future of the Government and of the country might be at stake, as well as his own political career."</p></blockquote>
Frankly, while I have no malice against the right hon. Gentleman, and I do not give a damn about his political career, but I am concerned about the future of the country.<br><br>
It has emerged clearly from our deliberations that this is a bad Bill and there is nothing "softly, softly" about it. The Secretary of State may be trying to con people into thinking that he is adopting a "softly, softly" approach, but there is nothing soft in the Bill. In certain parts,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1094">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1103</span>
particularly clause 9, it is extremely evil in that it is shackling the trade union movement. Let there be no mealy-mouthed sentiments about that. That is the objective of the Secretary of State, and clause 9 is aimed at shackling the movement. It is clearly aimed at ensuring that no more union membership agreements will be signed. The terms of clause 9 and what can flow from in it relation to a handful of individuals do not provide for agreement ever being reached again.<br><br>
I suspect, although I have not had an opportunity to study new clause 12, that this clause in conjunction with new clause 12 will attack existing closed shop agreements. It is important that we highlight the ramifications that will flow from the Bill, especially from clause 9.<br><br>
My right hon. and hon. Friends have shown that while the Bill may at this stage be aimed at the trade union movement—which is the intention of the Under Secretary and the Secretary of State—it could cover a far wider range of people and involve a worsening of industrial relations, with some nasty situations developing in industry from the application of clause 9.<br><br>
I have been in many areas of industry where a dispute has arisen over an individual, and not necessarily over an attempt to get the individual removed from the establishment as such but to have him removed from a particular part of the factory, ship or plant, for various reasons. There can be many reasons why workmen in a specific area wish for the removal of an individual, although not necessarily out of the factory or plant completely. If the management decides to use the clause to get rid of an individual and at the same time probably have a go at a shop steward, clause 9 is an open invitation for that kind of machination to take place. Far from improving industrial relations, it will in many cases worsen them.<br><br>
I took special note of what the Under-Secretary said this morning. He has repeated a number of times that the Government are firmly committed to trade unions taking all proper steps to further their affairs. But it needs to be said that what the Government are doing is fixing iron shackles round the ankles of the trade union movement, expecting that when Unions seek to take those proper steps they will fall flat on their face. That is part of the Government's approach, and clause 9 is an example of it.<br><br>
In the context of this clause, we talk
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1104</span>
about the protection of individuals' rights—a noble sentiment to which we are all prepared to subscribe. There are many documents—the United Nations Charter is one—which use such words, and some of the world's most vicious tyrannies have subscribed to them. We must put this in the perspective of our industrial history, in which the trade unions have sought to protect and improve the rights of the individual and successive Tory Governments have sought to attack them. It is important that we get that on record.<br><br>
If the Government had any intelligence—and it is clear that whatever intelligence was within their ranks is diminishing rapidly—they would accept our suggestion that clause 9, a thoroughly bad and evil clause which will create untold damage, be withdrawn, and thank us for making it. I doubt, however that that much intelligence remains among them. We shall divide the Committee and try to bring common sense to our proceedings by attempting to have the clause deleted from the Bill.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We cannot allow clause 9 to pass without commenting again on the unsatisfactory answers that we have received to the many questions which we have raised.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) mentioned the Secretary of State's broadcast yesterday in which he said, when dealing with secondary picketing, that it was not his intention to make trade union funds the subject of attack and an individual employer would have to take out his own prosecution against the offenders.<br><br>
In contrast to that, under this clause trade union funds are open to attack. They may be attacked to the extent of hundreds of thousands of pounds if there are cases of employees taking unfair dismissal appeals before the industrial court.<br><br>
One aspect of the matter has probably been overlooked during the debate. I refer to the awkward member—the bad egg, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) described him—who repeatedly gets behind with contributions to the union and, after going before the district committee on a few occasions, gets into arrears again. Finally, the shop steward goes to the manager and asks "Will you tell him that unless he continues to be a member of the union we will have to take industrial action?"<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1095">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1105</span>
It may well be that that individual, who, I remind the Committee, may have objected to paying his 40p or 50p per week in union contributions, sees this as an avenue for getting substantial damages at the expense both of his employer and the trade union. Some individuals will do this. They will see it as a much safer chance than the pools, because the odds are much better. If someone wants to be a bit of a maverick in a factory, he will think that "there is £10,000, £12,000 or £14,000 waiting for him if his appeal is successful, so he will adopt an attitude of deliberately provoking his union to go to the management and say "We shall ban overtime, take industrial action, or go slow unless you tell this man that we are not prepared to work with him."<br><br>
It will be seen as a charter for irresponsible people, who have no interest in the trade union movement but are concerned only with saving the weekly contributions, to provoke industrial action by the unions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In case any members of the Committee should think that what my hon. Friend is putting forward is some exaggerated flight of fancy, I recommend that they read <i>The Times</i> of 9 November and 9 December 1972. I referred this morning to the case of Mr. James Goad who fell into the category suggested by my hon. Friend—the person who repeatedly lapses membership through arrears. Mr. James Goad did it three times, as a consequence of which his fellow workers refused to accept him at his place of employment. As <i>The Times</i> reported on those dates, Mr. Goad told his employers that if they were prepared to give him £30,000 he would go home and forget all about it. The proposition was put forward in 1972 that for £30,000 a man would drop the whole issue and stop being a nuisance to his employers and everyone else.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. This is another indication that out of 12 million or 13 million organised workers, there are groups or individuals who are concerned with getting as much as possible out of their employers. If a man has the hope of buying a little corner shop and wants to get £10,000 or £14,000, this is an ideal opportunity for such renegades of the trade union movement to provoke their union into taking action against them. That
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1106</span>
aspect has not been dealt with at all, and I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will reply on it.<br><br>
The Government are writing a recipe for people to take such action offering the chance—very much better than by filling in a football coupon each week—of getting a substantial sum, partly from the employer and partly from the union, and in some cases wholly from the union. That aspect must be dealt with if the Bill is not to be a millstone round the necks of both employers and trade unionists.<br><br>
Now I want to deal with whether this provision is aimed at trade unions or trade unionists. The hon. and learned Gentleman has referred many times to the new section 76A(1)(<i>b</i>) but not to paragraph (<i>a</i>), which refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"pressure which a trade union or other person exercised on him".</p></blockquote>
The first difficulty is to decide who is responsible for the dismissal of an individual. My right hon. Friend mentioned a case in 1972 and another in 1977. I can give the hon. and learned Gentleman a case which occurred only a few days ago, when about 75 per cent, of the buses in London stopped running. The reason was that in a particular garage employees objected to a foreman who they claimed was a bully. They said it was intolerable to work under him, and refused to do so. So they walked out. I am not familiar with the case, but presumably a decision was taken by the local bus depot committee. It may have been taken spontaneously by a group of busmen who walked out of that depot and phoned up other depots, so that about two-thirds of the bus drivers and conductors in London stopped work for a day.<br><br>
The London Transport management lost, perhaps, ten or even hundreds of thousands of pounds in revenue. They may decide to dismiss the foreman if that is not to happen again. I understand that they have transferred him to a course somewhere, and he is not working at the garage. If he is dismissed and matters take their course, someone must decide whom to proceed against. The Transport and General Workers' Union had made no decision to come out on strike. We do not know whether the local bus committee made a decision to bring members out on a day's strike. We do not know what individual was responsible. So how is blame to be apportioned? How is this clause—which is aimed at individuals as well as unions—to be implemented? The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1096">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1107</span>
Government will find themselves in all sorts of difficulties if they try to interpret this clause as it is written.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman, in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther), suggested that the tribunals might not or would not consider a ban on overtime as being pressure brought to bear against an employer. Where does he get that from? The hon. and learned Gentleman is not writing the law. We do not imagine that chairmen and members of industrial tribunals will send for all the printed proceedings of our Committee, read them diligently and say "The Under-Secretary recommends us to adopt this view". They will adopt their own law. The hon. and learned Gentleman has not yet become a judge. He is not yet writing case law. He may well be one day, he waffles on so much. He would be a very good candidate. But he is not and therefore he cannot give his interpretation of something that is likely to happen.<br><br>
Let me give an example. Let us suppose that a man has left the union, having persistently refused to pay his contributions, and the shop steward goes to the management and says "We intend to ban overtime unless that man is dismissed, or unless you warn him that he will be dismissed." This could have a big impact on the firm. It may have tendered for an overseas contract with a penalty clause saying that if the order is not delivered within, say, a month £100,000 or so will be payable. The employer may therefore say that overtime is essential to enable the order to be completed, so in his own interest—employers always view these matters in their own interests—he may have to dismiss that man.<br><br>
The tribunal may say that it was the action of the union in banning overtime that caused the man to be dismissed and the trade union may then face heavy damages. It is therefore incorrect to take these cases out of the air and say that that would not be regarded as industrial pressure. The shop steward may only ask an employer to warn the employee that he might be sacked, and this might be regarded as undue pressure.<br><br>
A horse and cart could be drawn through this legislation, and the Government will get into serious difficulties if they persist with this clause. I believe that it is one more method of bashing trade unions. This is the only theory I can advance. I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1108</span>
thought, before reading it closely, that it might be window-dressing because employers need not take cases, and intelligent ones will not take cases. But there are hundreds of Grunwicks about, and people who take an antagonistic attitude towards trade unions will seize on this legislation to try and bash them again. It is a dangerous clause and is part of a dangerous Bill. I hope that the Committee will reject it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher) spoke of a maverick on the shop floor. There are one or two of them in almost every factory. They are the people whom I have called the sea lawyers—the chap who is always looking for ways of catching somebody out on the law, on the company's working rules, on custom and practice, or on the rules of the trade union.<br><br>
We suffer in our community from litigious people, and in my experience, in industry above all they need to be avoided like the plague. I do not expect the hon. and learned Gentleman to respect my view on that because litigious people are the source of buoyant demand for the services of the profession of which he is such a distinguished member—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A closed shop, too.</span></p>
<p>5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—but anybody other than those who stand to benefit directly from litigiousness knows that it is an unmitigated nuisance. My right hon. Friend referred us to a case in 1972 when such a gentleman sought in the most cynical way to make profit out of litigiousness. But since 1972 there has been a sinister development which adds considerably to the problem we face. I refer to the growth of some well breeched, well financed anti-trade union organisations which are ready to stand behind anybody willing to go to law to the detriment of a trade union.<br><br>
We all know that such organisations exist and which they are. They seem able to put their hands on plenty of money, but we do not know where it comes from. They are coy about that. But they can always find the costs of an action even when it is expensive. The insistence of such organisations will undoubtedly encourage the man on the make—the sea lawyer—who sees some chance of getting money by causing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1097">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1109</span>
trouble or, even more profitably from his point of view, merely by the threat of it.<br><br>
I can see an awful lot of law coming out of the clause. Every time law enters into industrial relations love flies out of the window. It follows absolutely and inexorably that every intrusion of the law into relations between employers and employees leads to their deterioration. I envisage that happening a great deal, with the help and support of those who seek deliberately to make mischief of that sort.<br><br>
I must tell the hon. and learned Gentleman—although, in the light of what my hon. Friend the Member for Darlington said about him, perhaps I should refer to him as the embryonic Lord Justice Mayhew—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John MacGregor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Lord Chancellor Mayhew.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—that those who have responsibility in the Department of which he is such a shining ornament will live to regret over the next two or three years many of the items that are in the Bill, and not least the clause that we are discussing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall take only a few minutes to develop the interesting theme that was opened up by my hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Evans). There is need to consider the clause in conjunction with clause 6, because the two closely hang together. It was rightly pointed out by the Under-Secretary of State that clause 9 deals with circumstances in which no union membership agreement is in operation. That is true. The trade unions are concerned to develop a position in which a union membership agreement can be brought into operation. Clause 9 is clearly intended to prevent that happening.<br><br>
Against opposition from this side of the Committee, clause 6 has unfortunately been passed. It requires an 80 per cent. majority of the electorate before a union membership agreement is enforceable. We have been told that there is nothing to prevent its being signed, but it will not mean anything and cannot be enforced.<br><br>
How, then, will a trade union go about acquiring the 80 per cent. majority that it needs? Clause 9 is clearly designed to prevent that happening because it knocks a union's principal weapon for recruiting members by penalising it for taking any
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1110</span>
sort of industrial action in the furtherance of recruitment. That is what the clause is about. Its purpose is to prevent a trade union organisation in any factory, office or shop from using its normal weapon—perhaps the threat of an overtime ban—to reach the point of negotiating a UMA and have the necessary size of ballot to bring that into operation. If that is not the purpose of the clause, I should like to know what it is. Certainly, there has been no other explanation from the Government.<br><br>
By imposing penalties either on a trade union or on individual members—shop stewards, for example—the clause is clearly intended to be a sharp and firm brake on a union's ability to have sufficient force behind it for a closed shop agreement.<br><br>
During a previous debate—I stress "even"—the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst), who is not exactly famous for his sympathy with trade unionism, told us that he was not against unionists being allowed to withdraw their labour for whatever purpose they liked. He said that in support of an amendment which he and the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) had tabled jointly.<br><br>
We are now faced with a clause which will ensure that trade unionists who withdraw their labour in support of the valid objective of increasing union membership will be penalised to a considerable extent, possibly to the tune of thousands of pounds. If the hon. Member for Hendon, North really believes what he told us a week or two ago, he should vote against the clause. It imposes a severe penalty for the withdrawal of labour—or even the threat of it, or even the threat of withdrawal of overtime—if that is done to persuade the employer to get rid of a non-trade unionist so as to improve the union's organisation in the factory.<br><br>
That is the most serious aspect of the matter. It is intended not just to provide some sort of protection for an employer who has been put under pressure by a trade union but to prevent that trade union—or the trade unionists; I am more concerned with the interests of the individual members than with the organisation as a body—to improve its position by recruiting more members and increasing its strength in the factory.<br><br>
The Opposition have exposed the Bill for what it is. The impression is given in newspapers that the Secretary of State is on the "softly, softly" side of the Cabinet
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1098">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1111</span>
and that he is really sympathetic to the trade union movement, and such nonsense as that. In many ways the Bill is more vicious than the 1971 Act in its treatment of trade unions, although it is more pernicious and subtle.<br><br>
The Committee has sat for 80 or 90 hours, yet hardly a word of what has been said has appeared in the press. That is remarkable. At the same time, some newspapers are cultivating the notion that the right hon. Gentleman is really a great supporter of the trade union movement, he is being careful not to upset the unions, he is having a great battle in the Cabinet with some people who are rather nasty to them but he is a great friend of the movement. Nothing could be further from the truth. If the press had published just one-tenth of our debates in this Committee, that myth would have been exposed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, shall be mercifully brief, but the Committee should not underestimate our fundamental opposition to the clause. On clause stand part we deal with fundamentals, and I invite hon. Members on the Government Benches to consider their position. They vote like robots or automatons—or lemming-like for whatever is put before them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will there be any Gadarene rebels, I wonder.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have to tell to the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) apropos of something that we discussed a couple of days ago, that a letter in <i>The Guardian</i> today refers to the fact the Conservatives have a tenuous hold on power, having obtained the support of only 33 per cent. of the electorate at the last election. If he doubles that, he will get a figure of 66 per cent.<br><br>
I quote briefly from <i>The Guardian</i> editorial today!
<br><blockquote><p>"There is a deal of anxiety amongst industrial relations practitioners about some of the small print in the Employment Bill. There is a growing sense of unease among some Conservative backbenchers about what appear to be deliberately divisive social policies."</p></blockquote>
As they have such a tenuous hold on power, and the <i>Daily Mail</i>opinion poll yesterday showed the Conservatives trailing 8 per cent. behind Labour, are the Government right to make this attack on the fundamentals of a British institution, the trade union movement? I ask them to stop in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1112</span>
their tracks and to consider whether they are doing the right thing.<br><br>
Some of us, including my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) and my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther), were able on Sunday to refresh ourselves by meeting many thousands of people who were brought out on to the streets to demonstrate against the Bill. I think that my hon. Friends will agree that, talking to our colleagues, we found a hardening of attitudes and a sense of alienation. They had been this way before. They sympathised with our attempts to amend the Bill, but thought that the Government would probably get their own way. Nevertheless, they took a sanguine view and were not too worried. They had survived the 1971 Act and they would survive this. There would be a rough passage, "a bloody time", as one person called it, without meaning that there would be blood in the streets or anything of that kind. They had heard about £100,000 fines and people going to prison. Their attitude was, "We have survived all that. We shall still be here".<br><br>
Instead of welding the nation together, the Government are splitting and dividing it. But will these further causes of litigation do the country any good? One might argue that they are a sop to the extremists in the Conservative Party. I believe that this will do a great deal of harm. It will do no good to industrial relations. It is completely unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mark Wolfson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Much of what the hon. Gentleman has said might carry more weight if his own party had not been equally sure on a previous occasion that reform of trade union law, in many ways rather similar to this, was absolutely necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nonsene.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that members of the Committee will give that intervention the regard that is due to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Needham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I end on this note. My right hon. Friend quoted <i>The Times</i> of 1972. I refer hon. Members opposite to <i>The Times</i> of last Friday. I ask them to read the article by their hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mr. Clark).
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1099">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1113</span>
He said that he did not believe that the trade unions could be subjugated. He said that their support could be won. One could win the hearts and minds of people in the British trade union movements, but one could not subjugate that movement. It is not on. It has been tried several times. As the hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Wolfson) mentioned, there were even some members of the Labour Party, without much experience of industrial relations, who thought that certains things could be done in a misguided way.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
I ask hon. Members opposite to pause in their tracks, to think a little about what they are doing, and to ask themselves whether they will get any gains out of the measure that they are railroading through this House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The theme and purpose of the clause is to enable an employer to have shared the responsibility for an unfair dismissal that has been brought about because he has been pressurised to get rid of somebody by a union that objects to the fact that the person is not a member of that union. That is the theme, and the debate should concern itself with the theme and with the principle.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) expressed the hope that more of what takes place in the Committee will appear in the press. I can think of no better speech with which to embark upon that new regime than the hon. Gentleman's own. He said that the principal means by which a union could achieve 80 per cent. or more membership and support for a closed shop was the threat of industrial action against those who would not join voluntarily. I do not misquote him. In his fair way, he nods assent to that as a fair account.<br><br>
I gladly acknowledge that it is a merit of the clause that it places an obstacle in the path of a union which, in the knowledge that it cannot persuade people to join voluntarily, tells them that they are to join by virtue of the industrial action that it can take against them. I thought that British trade unionism was founded upon the voluntary principle. Why should it be regarded as a virtue to be safeguarded in such a way under existing law a union may pressurise a person to join who does not wish to do so of his own accord? Why
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1114</span>
should it be regarded as a defect of the clause that it will make it more difficult for a union to do that?<br><br>
The TUC said in its guidelines:
<br><blockquote><p>"The General Council advise that unions should adopt approaches which place the main emphasis on unions themselves persuading workers of the benefits of trade union membership."</p></blockquote>
To that we say "Hear, hear". It is fair to add that at the beginning of that paragraph it also said:
<br><blockquote><p>"There are a number of ways of achieving 100 per cent. membership ranging from a refusal to work with non-unionists to a formal agreement with an employer."</p></blockquote>
But why is the ability to persuade not mentioned by the hon. Gentleman? Why dismiss the possibility of persuading people to join voluntarily?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the hon. and learned Gentleman should be so appalled at the notion of trade unionists using whatever strength they may have to improve their own position by perhaps only threatening industrial action in order to get someone either to join the union or to leave the firm. Clause 6 of his own Bill provides for that in certain circumstances, as indeed do earlier clauses. The Bill allows circumstances in which a person may be forced to join the union or leave the firm. If the hon. and learned Gentleman is arguing on principles, rather than degrees or implementation, he must get this right. His own Government have produced a Bill which provides in certain circumstances for this kind of pressure or compulsion upon an individual. So let him not get self-righteous. If he wishes to say that in no circumstances may pressure properly be applied to people through threats of industrial action in order to make them join the union, he had better take the Bill away and rewrite it, because that is not what it says.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is perhaps bad enough that where there is a closed shop agreement a person may be forced to leave his job, albeit with compensation. But that is in the case where an agreement—based, under the provisions of the clause, upon the consent of an overwhelming majority of those to be affected by it—has been made between the union and the employer. That is not what clause 9 is concerned with.<br><br>
Under the provisions of the Bill, it will not be possible for someone to be dismissed without compensation so long as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1100">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1115</span>
he is an existing employee already on the payroll. Leaving aside the conscience clause, it would be possible for someone to be dismissed only when, in the case of a newly-made post-entry closed shop agreement, he had told his employer on being offered the job that he would join a union within a reasonable time, but had failed to comply with that undertaking. In those circumstances it would be open to his employer to sack him without compensation. But that is a very limited derogation from the principle.<br><br>
By all means let it be set forth in the press that the Opposition see as a justification for opposing the clause the fact that it puts an obstacle in the way of getting 80 or 85 per cent.—or whatever the figure may be—support for a closed shop agreement not by voluntary means, and by persuasion, but by the threat of industrial action.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) said that it was extremely important that the provision was not limited to closed shops. I absolutely agree. It is not limited to closed shops. It extends to industrial action threatened or taken against an individual where it has not been possible to achieve a closed shop agreement. To me that makes the clause all the more desirable.<br><br>
I at once accept that the Opposition have not accepted the principle of joinder. I did not seek to find that assertion in the terms of amendment No. 126. I thought that the principle was being acknowledged by hon. Gentlemens opposite during the course of my speech. However, I readily allow that I was mistaken. They tell me that it was not acknowledged. I am perfectly content to accept that.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher) reverted to the circumstances, suggested this morning, of a shop steward who threatens industrial action unless the employer tells a particular employee to become a member of a union. It is helpful if from time to time I respond to questions about how tribunals would deal with certain situations. The situation that I have just mentioned has been put forward.<br><br>
I have said that I consider it unlikely that, if that conduct stood by itself and alone, the tribunal would say that it was grounds for joining the union and getting a contribution. I think that that is right.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman went on to suggest that someone might deliberately provoke the union. Shop stewards would then
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1116</span>
respond by saying to the employer, "Unless you tell this man that we are not prepared to work with him we shall strike." The hon. Gentleman then talked about situations on the buses, and about the foreman who was such a bully that it was intolerable to work under him. The men therefore walked out. The hon. Gentleman asked whether joinder could take place there. If London Transport sacked the foreman, was it to be said that those men should be joined and should be made liable? The hon. Member for Darlington asked me to deal with that point. I hesitate to take any more of the Committee's time, however, because whenever I try to address myself to the point the hon. Gentleman regards what I say as waffle, worthy of a judge or even of a Lord Just ice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Giles Radice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Lord Chancellor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, or even of the Lord Chancellor. Honours <i>in future</i> have been heaped upon my bashful head.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The wish is father to the thought.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Far from it. I should very much enjoy appointing the judges but I have no wish to join them. There is no prospect, I may say, of my doing either.<br><br>
However, at the risk of being thought to be waffling once again, I wish to invite the hon. Member for Darlington to address himself to the point on this occasion. In neither of the two instances that he put forward would there be any possibility of joinder. Take the case of the buses. The bully is not being dismissed because he is not a member of the union but because it is intolerable to work with him. I repeat once more that the clause is concerned with joinder only where pressure was exercised because the employee was not a member of any trade union, or of a particular trade union. The possibility of joinder would not arise.<br><br>
The possibility does not arise in the other case postulated either, where someone has deliberately provoked the union so that its officials say, "Unless you tell this man that we are not prepared to work with him we shall strike." The clause homes in on a very narrow category of case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman deal a little more fully
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1101">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1117</span>
with the second example? If the man at the centre of the controversey, whom the shop stewards have asked the management to dismiss, is a member of the union, surely that comes into the relevant category. I should like the Under-Secretary to say what is to be done with mavericks who deliberately provoke the union into starting industrial action in the hope that they may get a substantial sum as the result of an appearance before an industrial tribunal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the first question assumes that the bully is or is not a member of the union. However, it does not matter which. He is being sacked because to work for him is intolerable. Therefore he is not being sacked because of that kind of pressure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. and learned Gentleman has grasped my point. I am not talking now about the dispute at the garage. I am talking about cases—they are bound to arise with 12 million trade unionists—where a maverick, who is a member of the trade union, deliberately on a number of occasions falls out of union membership. Eventually he provokes the union into threatening the management with industrial action. The man, probably backed by the National Association for Freedom and others who may give him assistance, does this quite deliberately in the expectation of getting a substantial sum in damages. How would the Under-Secretary deal with that matter?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I shall not be castigated for saying how I should deal with it, on the ground that it is not for me to say how the tribunals shall act. However, in my view tribunals would be quite capable of seeing what had really happened in a case like that. They would be quite capable of seeing what really lay behind the actions of such a man. It is doubtful in the first instance whether he would necessarily even be able to establish unfair dismissal, let alone whether the employer would be able to establish a right to a contribution against the union. In any event, even if such a man were to establish unfair dismissal the compensation would be likely to be extremely low. In that case there would be no virtue in taking a claim for joinder.<br><br>
That is how, in reality, that type of case is likely to be dealt with by a tribunal. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1118</span>
tribunal will include among its members a trade union representative and an employers' representative. I do not wish to take any longer in dealing with the case, bearing in mind the fearful castigations that I have had for waffling. I am quite prepared to accept those castigations. However, I do try to answer the points.<br><br>
Now I wish to deal with the point about the maverick made by the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo), whom I congratulate upon his splendid tartan tie. He has bestowed upon me the future rank of a Lord Justice. The hon. Gentleman reflected in a philosophical way about what would happen in the case of the maverick, the sea lawyer. I think that the sea lawyer is very obvious when he turns up. He is a pain in the neck to everyone and is easily recognised by industrial tribunals. I do not think that the Committee should be ridden off the principle of the Bill, which I shall not repeat, on the basis that there may be some who will seek to exploit it for unworthy motives. Not least of the reasons why we should not be influenced by such arguments is that in most cases such people will be rumbled for what they are at an early stage.<br><br>
We congratulate the hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) on having his spectacles restored to him. The hon. Gentleman's loss this morning was our loss as well. We are glad that he feels able once more to contribute to our proceedings. However, I feel that the points that he made so exuberantly have really been covered in my answers to the points made by his right hon. and hon. Friends. I do not believe that I can usefully say more about them.<br><br>
I recognise that it is important that nothing in the Bill should lack realism, or should be included for dogmatic reasons or for reasons designed to remedy injustices under the present law. By that test the principle of this Bill passes and I trust that my hon. Friends will support this clause.</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Two points made by the hon. and learned Gentleman deserve comment. First, he said we should be addressing ourselves to the theme and principle of the clause. I must emphasise that we must bear in mind not only the theme and principle but also the fact that, when this legislation appears before the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1102">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1119</span>
tribunal or other judicial body in the form of an Act, it will not be the theme and principle, but the letter of the law and so we must concern ourselves with the letter as well as with themes and principles.<br><br>
Second, and more important, if the hon. and learned Gentleman wants to invoke principle, I ask him to reflect that the Government and their supporters seem to think that the employer should have a right to choose whom he should employ. The extent to which that should be applicable is part of the debate and dialogue</span></p>

NOTICES TO EMPLOYER</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 156, in page 11, line 29, after "or", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"if the confinement has occurred,".</p></blockquote>
The effect of this amendment is technical, to clear up a drafting ambiguity and to make it clear that the employee does not have a free choice between notifying the expected week of confinement or notifying the actual date of confinement. The employee must give the expected week of confinement unless it is not reasonably practical for notice to be given before the baby is born—for example, if the birth is premature, in which case the actual date must be given instead. The amendment is intended to make clear which date of confinement the woman is expected to give.<br><br>
As the provision stands, it might be interpreted as giving the woman a choice between notifying the expected week of confinement or notifying the actual date of confinement. This was not the aim of the new paragraph (<i>d</i>), where the option of providing the actual date of confinement is intended to be reserved for exceptional circumstances. The amendment would put</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1120</span>
<p>between us, but they insist that the employer has the right to choose whom he shall employ and have on his premises. The Government seem to think that the workers have no equal right to choose with whom they shall work, no matter how objectionable an individual should be. It is that assumption we are challenging.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 12, Noes 9.</p>
<p>this beyond doubt.</p>
<p>I am grateful to the Bar Association for Commerce, Finance and Industry for drawing our attention to this possible ambiguity.</p>
<p>I have dealt with this as a technical, almost formal amendment, and although it is the first under clause 10, I propose, if the Committee agrees, not to deal with the merits of the clause or its proposals at this stage but merely to get this drafting ambiguity out of the way. If it meets the convenience of the Committee, that is all I propose to say.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not object to the amendment and do not see how anybody can but, with great respect to the hon. and learned Gentleman, if I heard him aright it does not achieve the objective which he said he wants to achieve. I shall ask the hon. and learned Gentleman a question, and it will save time if he interrupts me now if I am wrong.<br><br>
Was I right in thinking that he said that he was trying to remove the option of notifying the expected week of confinement or the date of the confinement if the confinement has taken place, thus requiring both of them to be notified?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I correct that? I do not criticise anybody for not picking up the point. The option of notifying the date of confinement looks, as at present drafted—or is capable of looking, as at present drafted as if in each instance
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1103">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1121</span>
and for every woman claiming the right to maternity pay it is open. It is not intended to be open in every instance. What is intended is that the obligation to notify the expected week of confinement shall be that which alone normally applies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that that reinforces what I said because, for as long as the word "or" is there, there is an obligation, never mind what follows. For the present, let us forget what follows the word "or", whether that be the old wording or the new proposal. As long as the word "or" is there, there is an obligation upon the woman to do one or the other.<br><br>
I do not want to get into an argument with the hon. and learned Gentleman—it is his Bill and he has to live and sleep with it, and I do not—but if he has it wrong he had better have a think about it and get it right. I am not sure that his friends in the Bar Association have not let him down.<br><br>
However, that was not the main point that induced me to rise, and I wish to put another question to the hon. and learned Gentleman. This is not a political question but a syntactical question. It is not a point of opposition but one on which I offer co-operation and, indeed, coalition to the hon. and learned Gentleman because, no matter how much we may differ on the Bill, I believe that we join in having a great regard for the well of English, pure and undefiled. Therefore, we should see that we remove ambiguities and any excrescences—anything that is not necessary, any tautology, pleonasm or verbosity.<br><br>
In that connection, I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman to tell me the purport of the word "so" in line 28, because cannot figure out what that is meant to mean. Will he tell me what is the difference between the import of the present words and the effect they would have and the obligation they would place upon the woman from what it would be if the phrase read:
<br><blockquote><p>"and informs him of the expected week"?</p></blockquote>
I have been trying to figure out the import and purpose of the word "so". If it means anything, it means "by this means ". The woman is required to inform the employer of A and B "by means of" subsections (1)(<i>d</i>)(i) and (1)(<i>d</i>)(ii). That is to say, as a result of informing the employer of(<i>d</i>) (i) and(<i>d</i>) (ii) she will have informed him of the expected week of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1122</span>
confinement or that the confinement has taken place. But that cannot be so. The fact that the woman has informed the employer
<br><blockquote><p>"that she will be (or is) absent from work wholly or parrly because of pregnancy or confinement,"</p></blockquote>
and the fact that she has informed him
<br><blockquote><p>"that she intends to return to work with her employer"</p></blockquote>
does not constitute—which is what the word "so" says it does—informing him of the expected week of confinement or that the confinement has taken place.<br><br>
Let me see whether I can make this apparently abstruse point clear. What would be the difference if it merely said "and informs him"? To put it another way, what would be the different purport, if any, if subsection (1)(<i>d</i>)(ii) read:
<br><blockquote><p>"that she intends to return to work with her employer"</p></blockquote>
and a further subsection (1)(<i>d</i>)(iii) read:
<br><blockquote><p>"and of the expected week of confinement or that the confinement has to ken place"?</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: "So" equals "thus" "so" means "thus"—and "thus" relates to the mode in which the intimation is to be conveyed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Madel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In writing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Madel) says, that means in writing. The reason the last two lines appear in the new clause whereas they do not in section 33 of the current law is that in section 33 of the current law she has to inform her employer in writing only if he so requests within at least 21 days. Under the clause she has to inform him in writing, and therefore the word "so" in line 28 means "thus", which means in writing. The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question of what would be the difference is that without it she could inform her employers of the expected week of confinement either in writing or not. I hope that makes matters clear. I am always very ready to yield to the hon. Gentleman's very important syntactical points, but here the word is not an excresence or even a surplusage or a redundancy but is necessary and says in two letters what could be said in four.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With great respect to the hon. and learned Gentleman, I am grateful

for his kind observations. I am grateful for his kind observations about my tartan tie. He may be interested to know that it was presented to me in a street in Moscow by a Scottish trade union leader in return for my having helped him to get his money changed. He got into a mess with a bank clerk when trying to change some traveller's cheques.<br><br>
With great respect to the hon. and learned Gentleman, I do not think that he has matters right. I do not believe that the word "so" means "in writing", and if he wants to ensure that it is in writing I beg him to believe that the thing could be clearer. We must remember, as the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Madel) pointed out, that in line 21 it says:
<br><blockquote><p>"she informs her employer in writing at least twenty-one days"</p></blockquote>
—and so forth in (i) of so and so, in (ii) of so and so and in (iii) of
<br><blockquote><p>"the expected week of confinement o r the date of confinement"</p></blockquote>
—that would make the words "in writing" apply very specifically and clearly to those last words.<br><br>
However, I shall not get burnt up about it, and I must not take up the time of the Committee on syntactical exercises. Some grammarian 500 years hence will look at this and say, "Dear me, what a poor Parliament we had in 1980; they could not even get right the language let alone the law."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been corrected by those who draft these measures for the Government. "So" equals "in that way" rather than "thus", and I expect that that is right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: By this means.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am confident that "so" is not surplus and that it fulfils a useful purpose here. But we shall look at the matter because it is no part of our intention that there should be anything that is surplus, misleading or other than the pure stream of the English language in the Bill. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for drawing our attention to that and I am also grateful to him for giving us the pedigree of his tie. For my part, I thought it was the ancient tartan of the Clan Mikardo.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1124</span>
<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 136, in page 11, line 31, leave out "forty-nine days" and insert "eighteen weeks".<br><br>
I am sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman will be eternally grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) for his drafting expertise. I suspect that he will be less grateful to the Opposition as we toil through the other amendments to the clause and for the remarks that my hon. Friend will make later in the debate.<br><br>
I should like to say that in our tabling amendments to the clause and on the "clause stand part" debate there should be no doubting our total opposition to it. Our amendments will only try to salvage a little from what we regard as a thoroughly obnoxious clause.<br><br>
I should like to sketch the background to our thinking on the clause at this stage because I believe that it is necessary and relevant to explain why we have tabled this and other amendments. It is clear that in clause 10 the Government are again back on their claim of trying to help employers—particularly those with small firms—at the expense of workers' rights and benefits. In this case that particularly effects working women.<br><br>
The Government stated in the consultative document that employers have found the administrative procedure in claiming rebate to be burdensome. They said that this was especially true of small firms, but I shall not go far along that road on this clause because we shall discuss the matter in much more detail on clause 11. Once again there is little or no worthwhile evidence of that so-called administrative burden. The clause ranges right across the whole area of maternity benefit.<br><br>
In many ways it is the most petty and mean-minded of all the clauses in this thoroughly obnoxious Bill. It is in line with the Government's apparent thinking these days—perhaps one should attribute that primarily to the Secretary of State for Social Services—that a woman's place is in the home, irrespective of what she wants and believes is best. Perhaps more important in these days of soaring bills and rocketing inflation, it ignores the needs of her family and in effect subscribes to the outdated view that women go out to work primarily for pin money. I wonder just how out of touch are those with such views.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1105">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1125</span>
A good deal of research—some of it from the Department of Health and Social Security—is available to show that working wive's wages have prevented a massive number of families from falling into poverty, with all the additional cost to the State which that would entail. There is similar evidence, from which I shall not quote on this amendment, of the Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth which the Government unwisely disbanded—presumably, in part at least, because it was producing the sort of evidence to which I refer and which the Government find unpalatable.<br><br>
I do not know whether it is significant that this is the first Government of this country to be led by a woman Prime Minister. Candidly, I believe that she has been a total disaster for women's rights and equal rights. It does not matter whether we are talking about immigration laws, child benefit, education cuts—which will hit working women particularly—or especially about this Bill. We have already dealt with some of the privileges for small firms in clauses 5, 7 and 8 and we shall come to them again in clause 11. But there is a particularly detrimental effect on women, who now form such a large part of the work force, especially in small firms. Clause 16 also will have a severely detrimental effect on women, because that concerns the low pay aspect. Many women work in low paid jobs.<br><br>
We seek to amend clause 10 because it is a direct assault on the rights of working women. The clause will make it far more difficult, complicated and confusing for women to claim their rights. When the original legislation was being drafted, it was estimated that about 220,000 women would be eligible each year for maternity benefit. In fact, I understand that the fund has been paying out about 8,000 to 12,000 rebates each month. In 1977–78 the figure was 67,000, in 1978–79 it was 108,000, and in the months between April and December 1979 it was 84,000 rebates.<br><br>
There is a lack of evidence from the Government on the matter. We have heard a good deal already in our debates about the ORC study. It found that in firms with fewer than 50 employees much of the reason for the low take-up of maternity benefit was ignorance. Only 31 per cent. knew that any maternity pay could be reclaimed from the State, and just 6 per cent. knew that it could all be reclaimed.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1126</span>
The Committee has agreed that various procedures, including those concerning employment protection, need more publicity. But that is no excuse for truncating them and seeking to deprive probably quite a large number of working women of their benefits unless—I put this point to the hon. and learned Gentleman—it is another back-door way of trying to save public expenditure. Even though I have described it as a mean-minded measure, I should find that rather hard to believe. But I suppose that in the current climate of penny-pinching and saving on public expenditure it is a possibility.<br><br>
In 1977–78 maternity benefits cost £14 million, in 1978–79 it was £26 million and between April and December 1979 the figure was £22 million. So there are savings to be made. It may be that, although that was not the primary influence in the Government's bringing forward this change, that had something to do with it. At present, the Government judge everything against the background of public expenditure.<br><br>
I can find no good evidence whatever of a need for the change. It all appears to be anecdotal. Whereas on other clauses we have been able to say that the Government have first found some facts and then distorted them, for this one they have not been able to find any facts to distort. Perhaps we shall hear more about that as we proceed. As I have said, they seem to rely simply on anecdote.<br><br>
A large number of bodies with expertise in the matter have commented on the Government's proposals, and I shall refer to some of them. The Equal Opportunities Commission, which comprises not just trade union representatives and people concerned with women's rights issues, if one may loosely so describe them, but employers' representatives as well had this to say. I quote from the December-January issue of<i>EOC News:</i>
<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission finds little or no evidence that employers, large or small, have faced significant problems in operating the maternity provisions of the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act and adds that it would be unwise as well as undesirable to propose or embark on substantive changes in the rights of working women and women intending to return to work in the absence of convincing evidence."</p></blockquote>
It is not long since the wife of the Chancellor of the Exchequer was deputy chairman of the Equal Opportunities Commission. Although she was not still holding that office, I believe, when that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1106">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1127</span>
comment was made, I should be surprised if she did not continue to hold views such as those she expressed when she was deputy chairman. However, she does not seem to have had much success in convincing her husband of the wisdom of that point of view.<br><br>
I refer also to a speech which was made by the chairman of the Equal Opportunities Commission, Lady Lockwood. She said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission is extremely concerned at the prospect of any dilution of maternity rights. As it is, our provisions fall well short of those employed by women in other European countries such as France, Germany, Denmark, Austria and Sweden. Lack of maternity pay and leave had, for many years until the passing of the Employment Protection Act in 1975, been a real obstacle to women achieving equality in the workplace. These rights were won after a long and hard battle and the women of this country are simply not going to sit back and see them snatched away."</p></blockquote>
Certainly, Opposition Members share those sentiments.<br><br>
I want to turn to the specific wording of the amendment, because you may become worried if I do not come to that, Mr. Goodhew. However, I do not apologise for ranging a little widely because I think that it is necessary and relevant, as I said earlier, to our case.<br><br>
On the matter of deleting "forty-nine days" and inserting "eighteen weeks", we have consulted a number of organisations. The arguments that have been put to us—I do not pretend that they are mine—come mainly from women's organisations or from people with expertise in these matters. On the other hand, those Committee members who are husbands and parents will accept what I am going to say from their experience.<br><br>
Forty-nine days after birth is much too early to make a decision about a return to employment. The first post-natal check-up is usually 42 days after birth, and a significant number of women then have to have further checks, often due to complications in post-natal recovery. A variety of things can go wrong during that period.<br><br>
Child-minding arrangements are un-likely to have been worked out as early as 49 days after birth, and there is the question of feeding. I am told that breast-feeding can take about three months on average to become established.<br><br>
There is the simple but not unimportant question of lack of sleep due to night feeding. Again, it is not a very desirable time for a woman to make a proper assess-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1128</span>
ment of her future situation. She will probably be under strain and stress.<br><br>
There is uncertainty for the employer. A woman may say that she wants to return but feels unable to make a definite decision. Overall, it is unfair to put such a burden on women at such a time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Madel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is raising a very important point, and representations have been made about it. Each woman's medical condition is different. However, in subsection (2) he will see in line 38 the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"if that is not reasonably practicable."</p></blockquote>
I should have thought, bearing in mind that we put those vital words into much of our legislation, that those words covered the very points to which he has rightly drawn our attention.</span></p>
<p>6 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but I do not think that it is sufficient. Although I recognise that those words could be considered to be a safeguard, the right is removed, and the onus is on the employee to show "reasonable practicability". I do not think that that undermines my case.<br><br>
We suggested 18 weeks to give a woman a much longer period after having the baby before having to make a decision. If the Government want to suggest a different figure, stretching the period beyond 18 weeks, we do n006Ft quarrel with that. The hon. and learned Gentleman may feel that that is possible, but 18 weeks is not unreasonable.<br><br>
When considering the dilemma that a woman may face at such a time, there is also the trouble involved in the three different notifications which we shall come to later. This will add extra confusion and take time to sort out, which add to the stress and strain.<br><br>
Our provisions compare inadequately with those in the rest of Europe. The Department of Employment <i>Gazette</i> recently carried the results of a survey which showed that only one other EEC country had notification procedures that were qualifying conditions for reinstatement. The exception was West Germany, where one notification of intention to return was needed.<br><br>
I have had a response to a parliamentary question on this matter in which I asked what notification had been given to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1107">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1129</span>
European Commission of the proposed changes in maternity benefit, and whether there had been discussions about moves towards harmonisation of the benefits within the EEC. The response from the other Under-Secretary was:
<br><blockquote><p>"As none of the proposals infringes an EEC directive, no notification has been given to the European Commission, nor have any discussions been held. There are at present no moves towards harmonisation of these benefits within the EEC."</p></blockquote>
That is not good enough. We are told that the United Kingdom has decided that this in no way infringes an EEC directive and that, therefore, there is no need to give notification. But if the Commission itself had been given notification, it is not unreasonable to suggest that it might have taken a different view. of it was not given information, it is not in a position to express a view.<br><br>
There have been a number of occasions on which women's rights issues have been involved when the Commission has taken a different view from the United Kingdom Government, even when the previous Government were in office. So I should have thought that there was a need—indeed, an obligation—to tell the Commission about these changes, not least because, generally speaking, we lag behind the rest of Europe in maternity benefits.<br><br>
There is no real evidence of the necessity for a change. A recent survey by the Industrial Relations Review and Report, based on questions to 261 organisations in the public and private sectors, found that 83 per cent. of employers said that maternity provisions worked well in practice and that, in the main, the small number who thought otherwise had not experienced the maternity leave provisions, anyway. There seems to be nothing of any consequence to the contrary. In the light of that, we have no intention of doing other than opposing the clause vehemently but at this stage I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman to seriously consider accepting the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I first read the Bill one Sunday morning at home. When I reached clauses 10 and II, I suddenly realised that I had had no personal experience of maternity and therefore no first-hand knowledge of what state a woman is in immediately after giving birth to a child. I then discussed the clauses with my wife. The first question she asked was "How many women are on your Standing Committee?"
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1130</span>
Come to think of it—I had not thought of it before, and I wonder how many hon. Members have thought of it—it is a bit of a reflection on our Committee of Selection that when it selects hon. Members to discuss a Bill two clauses of which make important provisions for changes in the law on maternity benefit, it cannot find in our House a single woman to join our Committee. It would have been of benefit to have had a lady Member of the Committee, preferably one who had been a mother and had worked for a living.<br><br>
When talking to my wife, it occurred to me how ignorant we all are about this. None of us is in a position to assess the physical and psychological state of a woman in that immediate post-natal period and the extent to which her physical and psychological condition is conducive to her making a decision that is very important for her future, a decision of great moment.<br><br>
My wife said "I am not the best witness for you because I have to stretch my memory back a long way to remember what it was like." I then talked to my daughters, because their experience of such things is much more recent. One of them said something that I think is profoundly true, although I am not sure that it would be practicable to put it in the Bill. She said "If you want to be just about it, you ought to have a longer period for a woman after her first baby than after subsequent ones." The second time she knows what to expect. The problem with the first baby is that, despite what she has read or what mum or the ante-natal clinic has told her, the woman finds it a bit different from anything she was led to expect. But the second time she has had the experience and is more balanced, relaxed and sure of herself, and a little less insecure.<br><br>
If the hon. and learned Gentleman cannot accept my hon. Friend's amendment, he might give this a little thought and perhaps ask some of his specialist advisers and experts at the Department of Health and Social Security whether it would make sense to accept the proposal for 18 weeks, or some period longer than 49 days, for the first baby.<br><br>
The argument for a longer period, something like 18 weeks—it is an arbitrary figure, and no one will go to the stake for it—was well set out by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant), and I do not intend to repeat all the good things he said. But I wish to underline his
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1108">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1131</span>
remark that, in a sense, a longer period is in the interests of the employer, because the one thing the employer wants least is not to know where he stands or whether or not the woman is returning to work.<br><br>
Although I am in favour of better provisions for maternity leave and the right of return, I recognise that this creates difficulty for employers, and we would be stupid not to take that into account. We do so in spite of the difficulties because of the law of the greater good. But there are difficulties, and we should not seek to minimise them.<br><br>
I think that the earlier we require the woman to make the decision, the greater the likelihood that she will make it and then go back on it. An employer does not want that. He must have some degree of security. He will probably not be happy about having to wait a longer period to get a verdict, but if he knows that when the verdict comes it is likely to stick, I am sure that he will be in a better position than if he gets it earlier and is unsure whether he will have to alter his arrangements because the woman has changed her intention.<br><br>
I think—and I pick up from where my hon. Friend left off—that although these provisions in respect of women workers are not as good as in many other countries, they are one of the more civilised advances that we have made in legislation in recent years, and an attack on that advance is mean and unworthy. We ought not to be attacking that advance, but in this Bill I regret that we are. I hope that we can get at least a slight blunting of that attack by the acceptance of this amendment or of some substantial improvement in the provision made in the clause as it stands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to take up the theme followed by my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo). We are dealing with a very important matter, and I do not think it should be a party one.<br><br>
First, I do not think there is any evidence to show that the maternity provisions are detrimental to British industry or that if employment rights for women workers were diminished we would somehow have the key to unlock the entrepreneurial spirit of British industry. That would be misguided. There is no evidence that I know of. I have not had a letter from any employer in my constituency complaining about maternity provisions. A couple of weeks ago, I and my two colleagues had a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1132</span>
visit from the representatives of a Chamber of Commerce, but they complained primarily about VAT and the high minimum lending rate.<br><br>
But I know of no respectable evidence. There was a Department of Employment survey, to which we have all referred, and no doubt we shall go back to it during this debate, but that showed no evidence that these changes were necessary. The Minister may say again that the evidence is anecdotal. Last time we touched upon this he said so were the Gospels. f we are discussing these theological and maternity matters, I hope that hon. Gentlemen opposite will not attempt to apply the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception to this Bill because—I underline what my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow said—there are only men on this Committee.<br><br>
I put this strongly to Government supporters. This is a problem for women, and it should not be a party matter. If there is not strong evidence against these provisions, I think they have a duty to make some changes in the Bill. I should have thought they could support us on this rather than acting as automatons and blindly supporting what was put in front of them. There can be no real equality for women unless they have these rights in industry.<br><br>
6.15 p.m.<br><br>
We say that six weeks after confinement is far too early. The woman may have had a difficult birth. She may be overwhelmed by the needs of the baby. In my experience, when a baby comes into the house everyone's interests are subordinated to the interests of the baby. That includes the father, the grandfather and anybody else. The small new life takes precedence over everything. The woman may well be uncertain what she wants to do. To foist this decision upon her so that she has to make up her mind within six weeks is inhuman, and it is not a very gentlemanly or honourable thing for us to do.<br><br>
I therefore appeal to the hon. Members opposite to appreciate the position of women and to understand that it is extremely difficult for a woman to make a rational decision on this matter within six weeks of the birth, particularly if it is her first baby.<br><br>
I ask hon. Members to support the amendment, and not to regard it as a party matter on which they must keep rigid, iron
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1109">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1133</span>
party discipline. They should show that they have some human feelings as they will have to justify this to their own consciences, to their women constituents and perhaps to members of their own families.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Madel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition are right to raise these questions on the clause. As has been pointed out, at the time of the 1975 Act there was general acceptance of what we were doing and a recognition that we were making improvements in the law as it then existed and moving some way towards what is done in EEC countries.<br><br>
I take the point made by the hon. Members for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) and Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) that there may be special, difficult cases, often at the time of the first birth. Moreover, the pattern of antenatal care in this country is very uneven. I was a member of the old sub-committee of the Expenditure Committee which looked into the problems of perinatal and neo-natal deaths. I am not a member of the subsequent Select Committee which was set up last November, but I believe that the work is still going on.<br><br>
We found that in some parts of the country the risks to the mother were much greater than in others. Where the risks to the mother are greater, after the birth society may have the problem of a child who in later years simply cannot cope due to damage at birth which could have been avoided if the antenatal facilities had been improved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested to hear what the hon. Gentleman says. He will know that a new clause in my name and those of my hon. Friends deals with antenatal care. I do not claim credit for it. It is the brainchild of the Spastics Society and the all-party disablement group. That new clause seeks to encourage firms to give paid leave for antenatal care. It covers exactly the point that the hon. Gentleman has made, and I am sure that he will be sympathetic to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Madel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of the new clause, although I think that if one strayed too far into that subject one might be ruled out of order. In view of what has been said in the opening words of previous speeches, however, the point should be made. I was on the old sub-committee that looked into
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1134</span>
the matter and I take the point that has been made.<br><br>
I should like to make two points about the clause. First, when I interrupted the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant), who moved amendment No. 136, I drew his attention to the words in subsection (2):
<br><blockquote><p>"or, if that is not reasonably practicable, as soon as reasonably practicable."</p></blockquote>
Secondly, subsection (2) also states:
<br><blockquote><p>"an employee is requested in writing by her employer or a successor of his to give him written confirmation that she intends to return to work."</p></blockquote>
All that I would say on this is that I hope and believe that we have advanced in the way in which we conduct our affairs to the extent that an employer ought to be able to get the information, to have it sent to him, or to make it his or her business to find out whether the female employee has or has not had a difficult birth. We know of many cases in our constituencies where doctors write to employers, and will continue to write when the Bill is passed, pointing out that a particular patient has had a difficult birth and it is therefore far too soon to make any decision about whether she will wish to return to work.<br><br>
The clause refers to the employer
<br><blockquote><p>"or a successor of his".</p></blockquote>
I am not so happy about that, as I think that there may be difficulties. Under the clause,
<br><blockquote><p>"not earlier than forty-nine days",</p></blockquote>
the employer has to write to the employee to ask whether it is her intention to return to work. That provision, and the words,
<br><blockquote><p>"if that is not reasonably practicable",</p></blockquote>
provide two safeguards in this matter.<br><br>
Nowadays, 33 years after the introduction of the National Health Service, doctors quite rightly write many letters to housing authorities, to employers and to Members of Parliament, when they believe that such persons can help or ought to have information about patients. Given the two reasonable safeguards that I have pointed out, therefore, I think that the difficulties that have been raised can be avoided.<br><br>
The one point about which I am not too happy is the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"or a successor of his".</p></blockquote>
I think that we could run into difficulties there. But, as the clause is drafted, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1110">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1135</span>
employer has to make a move and actually write to find out. I hope and believe that in 1980 we have advanced sufficiently for employers not to write that letter if they have information that it has been a difficult birth or there are complications.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman is not giving a little too much credit to employers, and indeed to employees, in terms of the kind of understanding that they will have of the situation. This is a complex piece of legislation. Even as it stands, without the Government's intervention, it is clear from the evidence that has been produced that many people do not understand the existing legislation. This will make it even more confusing.<br><br>
Has the hon. Gentleman considered the case of, say, an immigrant employer with immigrant employees, where language difficulties may complicate the situation immeasurably? Does he really believe that the "reasonably practicable" safeguard that he regards as sufficient will be much of a safeguard at all in that situation? I must confess that I have grave doubts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Madel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think we must see how we go. If there were a lot of evidence that difficulties were being caused, we should have to alter the law again. I accept that. But my reason for intervening is that I do not think that one can say that there are no safeguards at all in the clause. Subsection (2) contains two safeguards, and I look to employers to act in a responsible and reasonable way in this matter, I look also, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman will agree, to trade union representatives to ensure that the rights contained in this legislation arc properly understood by the members and that the employer is fully aware of them when negotiations take place between employers and unions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo). There is something unreal about a Committee debating earnestly, vigorously and passionately matters that affect women, yet there is not a single woman on the Committee. We should think it absurd if the Bill, which affects trade unionists, were debated in Committee and yet there were no trade unionists on the Committee, or there were no lawyer on the Committee dealing with a Bill concerned with law reform—though some in the Committee may think that that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1136</span>
would be a good thing. Yet here we are debating a measure that affects women and only women, and somehow the Committee is bereft of the experts in the subject. My hon. Friend is absolutely right to draw attention to the absurdity of that position.<br><br>
I know enough about the law on maternity leave—I think that we all do—to realise that it has been of inestimable value to working women. Before the Government introduce legislation to alter that law, there should be overwhelming reasons for doing so. I should be interested to hear from the hon. and learned Gentleman exactly what those overwhelming reasons are. If he says that the maternity leave provisions have been an irritant or a nuisance to employers, I should like to know upon what evidence he bases that assertion.<br><br>
Whatever evidence he produces will have to outweigh the benefits that the maternity leave provisions have bestowed upon women. I doubt whether even the hon. and learned Gentleman can evince that argument with any great force. When I studied the clause, I was astounded to discover exactly what burdens and obstacles a woman claiming her rights under the maternity leave legislation had to negotiate before she could obtain those rights, even under the existing law. She must be employed immediately before the beginning of the eleventh week before the expected week of confinement. She must have at that time two years' continuous service — that is not changed. Under the existing law, she must inform her employer 21 days before the absence begins that she will be leaving and that she intends to return to work. Under the new law, 21 days before the absence begins she must inform her employer in writing first that she will be leaving, secondly the date of the expected week of confinement, and thirdly, that she intends to return to work.<br><br>
The argument that has been put forward repeatedly on behalf of employers is that the bureaucracy, the form-filling and letter-writing that they have to undertake, is a disincentive for them to take on new employees. It is an argument against excessive bureaucracy. Yet the woman intending to claim her rights already has to go through a lot of bureaucracy even under the existing law. Under the new proposals—from a Government who are pledged to eradicate bureaucracy as far as they can—more form-filling, more letter writing, has to be undertaken.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1111">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1137</span>
The hon. Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Madel) says that he looks to the trade unions to inform their members of their rights and of the necessary procedures for claiming those rights. It may well be that there are good trade union officials and not so good trade union officials. t may also be true that many women work in firms where there are no trade unions. A woman may not work in a trade union shop. Yet she is expected somehow to grasp all the complicated details of the legislation.<br><br>
The legislation puts further burdens upon her:
<br><blockquote><p>"not earlier than forty-nine days after the beginning of the expected week of confinement"</p></blockquote>
—an employer may make a written request for the woman to give
<br><blockquote><p>"written confirmation that she intends to return to work".</p></blockquote>
The woman must then give
<br><blockquote><p>"that confirmation within fourteen days of receiving the request or, if that is not reasonably practicable, as soon as reasonably practicable."</p></blockquote>
How on earth is a working woman expected to understand all that? Also, in an area of the law that is working reasonably well, why should extra burdens and impositions be put upon working women?<br><br>
Under the existing law the woman must give seven days' notice of her proposed date of return. Bur under the new law she will be required to give 21 days' written notice of her proposed date of return.<br><br>
6.30 p.m.<br><br>
To use a dreadful cliché, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. If it is true that employers find the maternity leave law complicated and therefore want it changed, why should the change mean that the women involved should have to cope with more impositions and burdens? The Minister has a duty to give the Committee overwhelmingly strong reasons why the law is not working effectively—if that is his argument—and also why all the extra paraphernalia and complication has to be imposed upon the woman, at a time when as my hon. Friends have said—she is going through enough difficulties already.<br><br>
It is not easy for men to talk about perinatal mortality and antenatal care. Those are not phrases that come naturally to us. But we all know that pregnancy is a difficult and critical time for a woman. The whole purpose of maternity leave legisla-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1138</span>
tion is as far as possible to enable her to bring a healthy baby into the world. The clause has been described as mean. I do not know whether it is mean. It is certainly unnecessary and irrevelant. I cannot see any justification for it. I shall be most anxious to hear upon exactly what basis the Minister seeks to justify this petty change.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to take up the request with which the hon. and learned Gentleman finished his speech. I can well understand that there may be feelings in the country, based on a first and perhaps inaccurate impression of the contents of the Bill, that the purpose is adversely to affect the interests of women who work. I hope that the Committee, at any rate, will accept my assurance that that is diametrically the opposite of the Government's intention.<br><br>
That would be wrong on both moral and economic grounds. It would also be plain stupid in terms of self-interest. I hope that even if the Opposition are not prepared to credit the Government with moral scruples, they will at least allow that the Government are not likely to do something quite plainly against their own interests, let alone the interests of the country.<br><br>
We all recognise what was said at the outset by the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) about the importance of the contribution made by working women, first to their own households and the maintenance of their families, and secondly, to the economy of the country. We want that contribution to be facilitated and enlarged. However, we are also conscious that many employers are put off employing women because they believe that the provisions giving rights to working women who become mothers are too burdensome and too uncertain for an employer thinking of expanding his work force to take on a woman.<br><br>
I am rightly asked why the Government take this view. I cannot find a place in my dictionary of pejorative words for the recently coined word "anecdotal"; it suggests that because somebody recounts a happening to somebody else it is necessarily untrue. Nevertheless, am able to draw attention to some findings that have been thought to be significant by bodies not generally associated with support for the Conservative Government. I begin with the Low Pay Unit, which, in a helpful publication—which has, I think, been sent
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1112">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1139</span>
to all members of is Committee—draws attention to a number of small scale surveys which clearly support the Government's view that there is a need for more reliable information on women's intention to return. That is the point, and if it has only just dawned on the hon. Member for Islington, Central that this is the point, I am glad to have been able to bring it to his attention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that is the best that the hon. and learned Gentleman can quote in support of his argument, it is not very strong. However, I am sure he is going on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intend to go on. We are dealing with an amendment that relates to new confirmation of the lady's intention to return which, under Clause 10, the employer can ask for not less than seven weeks after the confinement. That is what the amendment of the hon. Member for Islington, Central is about. The point of this amendment is the reliability of her intention to return. Accordingly it is important to know what evidence there is as to whether or not employers think there is need for greater reliability. The Low Pay Unit referred to a number of small scale surveys which it takes, in turn, I think, from the Equal Opportunities Commission. These can be found at the top of page 3 of the publication of the Low Pay Unit: Employment Bill Briefing No. 4:
<br><blockquote><p>"… a few small scale surveys which are described in the Equal Opportunities Commission's response to the Employment Bill, suggest that the rate of return is low."—</p></blockquote>
that means the numbers coming back—
<br><blockquote><p>"For example, the Federation of Scottish Bank Employers found that only 1 in 3 women declaring their intention to return to work after the birth of a child in tact did so. Barclays Bank also informed the Commission that of 724 women who preserved reinstatement rights in 1977, only 112 (15 per cent.) returned to work after taking maternity leave. More recently, a survey conducted for the Industrial Relations Review and Report (of a random sample of 261 of its subscriber organisations) found that of 7,390 women taking maternity pay, 60 per cent. indicated that they intended to return to work, whereas only 15 per cent. actually returned.<br><br></p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"The reasons for this low rate of return, however, appear to be related to the fact that the right to return is dependent on a statement 21 days before absence"—</p></blockquote>
that is before the birth—
<br><blockquote><p>"of the women's intention to return. Understandably, many women are extremely uncertain about the outcome of their pregnancy and therefore make the rational decision to preserve their rights until
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1140</span>
their position is clearer. In addition, it appears from the IR-RR survey that some personnel managers recommend that all pregnant employees state that they intend to return 'as an insurance policy'."</p></blockquote>
I pause there—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon Gentleman read the next paragraph.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I shall read the whole of it.
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government assumes that the proposed introduction of a second notification in writing of intention to return (if required by the employer) not earlier than 49 days after the beginning of the expected week of confinement, will benefit employers by reducing the present uncertainty. We would argue that the timing of this notification makes it extremely unlikely that it will have that effect. Six weeks after confinement is very early for a woman to be sure of her plans."</p></blockquote>
To that, I would say that she does not have to be under the clause.
<br><blockquote><p>"If she has had a difficult birth she may be unwilling to commit herself at that stage."</p></blockquote>
To that, I would say that she does not have to at that stage.
<br><blockquote><p>"Even if the birth has been relatively easy, the woman is likely to be overwhelmed in the first six weeks by the needs of the new baby. We can see no reason, therefore, why a written notification at this stage would be a more reliable indicator that the initial notification 21 days before absence begins. Furthermore, as far as the woman herself is concerned, if the situation is uncertain she would still be well advised to indicate that she wishes or return, so as not to lose her rights."</p></blockquote>
I am then quoted as having been asked what would happen if a woman gave her notice but did not return. I replied:
<br><blockquote><p>"The answer is exactly what would happen at present—nothing. It has been suggested that this should nullify the whole procedure. I doubt whether that is right, but if it is the case we shall have to reconsider the matter."</p></blockquote>
That was in response to an interruption.<br><br>
<br><blockquote><p>"We would suggest that the proposed notification should be dropped as it is unlikely to benefit employers in the manner intended, and wilt possibly place still further pressure on the women concerned."</p></blockquote>
I said that I would pause where I did because I was asked upon what evidence the Government based the contention that employers looked for greater reliability in the expressed intention of women that after they had their children they intended to return.<br><br>
The first two paragraphs that I read relate to that evidence. The third paragraph, which I gladly read at the cost of a few minutes of the Committee's time,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1113">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1141</span>
relates to the opinion of the Low Pay Unit, with which I am happy to deal. But as to the evidence, let it be acknowledged that independent surveys indicate that there is a marked disparity between the numbers of women who say on the only occasion that they are able to do so under existing law" Yes, please, we want maternity leave and maternity pay, Yes, please, we want to come back, and we wish, therefore, to claim our right to reinstatement and those who actually do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely pleased that the hon. and learned Gentleman read the remainder because, if the only evidence he can pray in aid is the Low Pay Unit let me point out that it argues completely the opposite case. Its evidence comes to the opposite conclusion from that which the Government argue. The unit's report states:
<br><blockquote><p>"We would argue that the timing of this notification makes it extremely unlikely that it will have that effect."</p></blockquote>
That is, the effect of giving extra certainty. It points out that employers advise women to say that they will come back just as an insurance policy. So the Low Pay Unit is arguing completely to the contrary of the hon. and learned Gentleman. Does he accept that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have observed already that the Low Pay Unit's opinion is conrary to mine, and I have already indicated that I hope I will soon be allowed to come to my opinion. At the moment, I am trying to deal with the request for the evidence, and I have cited the evidence.<br><br>
There is not only the evidence of the Low Pay Unit report. I rely upon what I am told in my constituency, as we are all entitled to do. On this occasion, I am also entitled to draw attention to what the Equal Opportunities Commission has said. Before I am assailed by roars of "Read on", or "Read backwards", and so on, let me say that the EOC says that the initial notification should be dropped altogether. But I am on the evidence at the moment, because I come to the conclusions to be drawn from it.<br><br>
The EOC, in its reply to our working paper, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The present notification 3 weeks before teaving is generally not regarded as a reliable indication of the woman's intention. There are a number of factors which may influence the employee to notify her intention to return; for example the fear of a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1142</span>
miscarriage or stillbirth, concern about being able to make adequate child care arrangements and uncertainty as to the possibility of the availability of part-time work where this is desired."</p></blockquote>
"Hear, hear" we would all say to that. No one is criticising women for not fulfilling their declared intention. Notification of it has to be given so long before the event—it may be 40 weeks before. There are so many uncertainties.<br><br>
The document goes on:
<br><blockquote><p>"Most of these worries will be overcome a short time after confinement, enabting the woman to make decisions about her future employment. It would therefore seem sensible; for both the employer and the employee, for notification to be given after the birth of a child and not before. The employee would notify the employer of her anticipated absence from employment due to pregnancy, giving the expected date of confinement. If the employer then wishes to know the employee's intention, a letter should be sent to her not earlier than 6 weeks after the date of expected confinement."</p></blockquote>
6.45 p.m.<br><br>
If I am asked for evidence as to the difficulties that employers face when assessing—as they have to for planning purposes—whether those who say they want to come back after their child is born will actually do so, impressive corroboration is to be found in that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. and learned Gentleman recognise that the EOC said that in the context of no prior notification? If the hon. and learned Gentleman is saying that he is prepared to accept that, I believe that we should be happy to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not only am I prepared to say that but I have already said it. I do not know how many times I must say it before I am accused by the hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher) of waffling. I have already prefaced it by saying that all this may be open to the criticism that the EOC says we do not want prior notification. But, unfortunately, employers have to plan their businesses and the smaller the employer's business the more necessary it is to be able to plan.<br><br>
The Government recognise that the best chance of women and, indeed, men being taken into employment who are not at present in employment, is if small employers in particular are encouraged to expand their work force. Therefore, I believe that I am entitled to say that there is a significant body of independent
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1114">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1143</span>
opinion—there is more that I have not cited—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Cite it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I prefer not to take the time of the Committee. I have indicated the surveys which have been referred to by the Low Pay Unit and the opinion of the Equal Opportunities Commission that a number of factors may influence the employee and so on. I have referred to the experience of myself and other hon. Members who have regard to the interests of businesses and employment. I believe that I am entitled to say that there is a significant body of independent evidence to support the proposition that employers are perturbed by the present law relating to the declaration or confirmation of an intention to return.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I really must press the hon. and learned Gentleman on this point and I want to insist that there is no evidence.<br><br>
Like the hon. and learned Gentleman I am indebted to the Low Pay Unit, which refers to the only respectable survey—rather than this anecdotal one—which was that carried out by the Department of Employment and which is sometimes referred to as the ORC report. Its study was of 301 firms with fewer than 50 employees; two-thirds of the sample employed I0 employees or fewer.<br><br>
That report says:
<br><blockquote><p>"when interviewees were asked whether any Government measures had caused difficulties, one person only mentioned the maternity provisions. Replying to a question whether any specific aspects of employment legislation had affected them, only two mentioned maternity rights. Subsequently respondents were given a specific list of 12 major legislative provisions and asked to indicate which they had experienced and whether they had caused them difficulties. Four per cent. had experience of holding a job open for 40 weeks for a pregnant woman and 2 per cent had given maternity pay. None of these respondents said that compliance with these provisions had caused them difficulties."</p></blockquote>
Those are the words of the survey commissioned by the Department, and quoted by the Low Pay Unit. Another item in the Low Pay Unit report was that, between July 1978 and July 1979, of 10 million working women only 11,600 took maternity leave. That is three out of every 1,000 married women of childbearing age. We are talking in terms of 0.3 per cent. None of those employers complained that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1144</span>
he had been caused any difficulty. That is the evidence and the facts produced by a Government Department survey and quoted by the Low Pay Unit. What evidence can the Minister produce?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall have to be a little more sparing in giving way if long speeches are going to be made.<br><br>
I have never contended that every survey or sample produces consistent results. I do not contest that the ORC survey produced the figures to which the hon. Gentleman referred, although I do not have the extract before me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: t is on page 4.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to accept that. No doubt it is right.<br><br>
If we are to seek a justification for an argument; surely we must have regard to a reasonably wide sampling of the evidence. In that context I have said that the condition of employment in this country is so parlous that no Government are entitled to close the door on a reform of the law that may reasonably be expected to result in more jobs if they can do so without seriously harming rights connected with either job protection or maternity legislation.<br><br>
If pressed to go further I will do so. I do not wish to take up time but on the other hand I do not wish it to be thought that I am concealing something. I shall refer to the response to the working papers of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce. It is to the members of such chambers of commerce that we must look for more jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Tory Party—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I sometimes wonder whether Opposition Members wish to hear any evidence or whether they seek only to undermine that evidence which seems unpalatable to them.<br><br>
In its commentary on clause 10 the Association of British Chambers of Commerce states:
<br><blockquote><p>"We welcome the requirements laid down which would reduce the nuisance of maternity provisions without materially reducing employees' rights. The clear separation of procedures for claiming maternity pay from those for return to work should help to reduce the real nuisance caused by employees who make an inaccurate statement of intent to return to work when they claim maternity pay."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1115">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1145</span>
On the following clause it says:
<br><blockquote><p>"We are very conscious of the difficulties employers face at present—they may not be able to find a satisfactory temporary employee replacement so have to engage a permanent employee".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not one employer—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Giles Radice</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. and learned Gentleman is clearly not giving way. He has given way a great deal, and I have allowed fairly lengthy interventions. It would speed the Committee's work if he were allowed to develop his case a little more.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Radice), who never makes speeches on interventions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Radice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All I wish to tell the hon. and learned Gentleman is that this is the third clause on which he has been asked to produce the evidence to support his argument and reasoning. It occurred on clauses 5 and 7, and now on this one. This is the third time that the hon. and learned Gentleman has been asked to produce the evidence, and he has failed to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what the hon. Gentleman would regard as evidence. Anecdotes are out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Radice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Something that would stand up in a court of law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is out, because it is regarded as anecdotal. What surveys yield is regarded as being of any value only if it supports the hon. Gentleman's side of the case. The small-scale surveys, the Federation of Scottish Bank Employees, Barclays Bank and the Industrial Relations Review all support the proposition that there is a wide disparity between those who say they will come back and those who do.<br><br>
One does not have to be particularly brilliant to appreciate that it must be a matter of concern to employers whether, having taken a woman into employment, they can rely on her coming back. The Equal Opportunities Commission says that 116,000 are likely to qualify for maternity leave, and it calculates that about 10 per cent.—that is, 11,600—actually take it up.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1146</span>
This clause is concerned with the other 105,000 women who could come back but who do not. We want to encourage them to come back if we can.<br><br>
Paragraph 4 of the ORC survey states that it was found—I believe that the hon. Gentleman mentioned this—that
<br><blockquote><p>"only 4 per cent. of the respondents had had experience of the maternity provisions and none of them had found it troublesome. Fourteen per cent., however, did report that they expected to find it troublesome to give pregnant women maternity leave while 20 per cent. expected to find it troublesome to hold a job open for up to 40 weeks, as opposed to 16 per cent. who expected to find the unfair dismissal provisions troublesome".</p></blockquote>
It may well be that the majority do not find that, but I believe that we must test the matter by reference to the law as it is. I am speaking without a note, and so I may be marginally inaccurate, but it is better for us to proceed. The law says that two notices must be given, the first not less than three weeks before one wishes to leave, or II weeks before the expected week of the confinement. Two statements must be made—first, that one intends to be away for that reason and, secondly, that one intends to come back. After that, one need have no contact with the employer until one week before the date when one intends to return to work after the confinement. Therefore that may be a total of 29 weeks after the date of the confinement.<br><br>
The provision in the clause says, in effect, "Let us suppose that the employer wants you. He must ask in writing, and wait at least seven weeks after confinement to confirm what you told him before you went, which is that you want to come back to work. He must say that in writing and ask you to tell him within a fortnight—or if that is not reasonably practicable as soon as possible—that you confirm that you want to return."<br><br>
Is that very unreasonable and a great attack on women's rights? What follows from it? If there is no response, the right to reinstatement is lost. But there is a later amendment to which the Government are sympathetic, that when confirmation is sought there shall be a notification appended so that the woman is advised of her rights and what the consequences will be if she does not reply. That proposal deserves sympathetic consideration. If she says "Yes, I will come back" but does not, she will not suffer anything. But it gives a more reliable indication to the employer of what the position is likely to be after confinement.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1116">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1147</span>
7 p.m.<br><br>
Everybody understands that within a week or two or, perhaps, even six weeks, people are still far from able to see what their position will be. Nobody will hold the woman to returning when she says that she will in response to a request which is made not earlier than seven weeks. It can be 18 weeks, voluntarily, but it must not be earlier than seven weeks. Nobody will pursue the woman and say she is liable for damages.<br><br>
That is the position. Without it—I rely here on the Equal Opportunities Commission and the passage I read out the employer has no means of knowing from 14 weeks before the confinement until one week before, under existing legislation, when she wants to come back. He has no means of getting an indication of when she wants to return. That is existing law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing to stop the employer writing, telephoning, or getting someone to see the employee. What the hon. and learned Gentleman is putting in the Bill can be done by the employer at present without the need to have it written into an Act of Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is so. The employer can do that. But confirmation is needed, in writing, that she intends to return. That serves to concentrate her mind. Moreover, if she says at that point—and this is where there is need for legislation—that she does not want to come back, or if she does not respond, and having been put on notice, as I believe would be the probable consequence, the employer is then free to plan ahead. He can get a full time replacement or assure the part-time replacement that she may stay on full time. He is able to plan ahead with more certainty. That is the point.<br><br>
I acknowledge that it is a pity we do not have a lady Member on the Committee. That is not the fault of the Committee. Everyone knows that the selection of our Committees rests with the House as a whole. I am reminded that there were no lady Members on the Committee of the Employment Protection Bill in 1975. t is a great pity, but we must do the best we can. The Government are trying to do the best they can for the employment of women by making it that much easier for employers to employ women in this small but necessary regard.<br><br>
That is why we feel it is necessary to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1148</span>
make this provision for notice. There is very little to get excited about if one looks at it dispassionately. If there was much to get excited about, I should have expected the Equal Opportunities Commission to have got excited about the proposal. It is true, before everyone shouts at me, that it says it does not want a notification, but it also says—and it is worth reminding the hon. Gentleman again—that the difficulties that are inherent in a woman making up her mind beforehand are not to be met a few weeks afterwards.<br><br>
The Equal Opportunities Commission states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Most of these worries will be overcome a short time after confinement, enabling the woman to make decisions about her future employment. It would therefore seem sensible, for both the employer and the employee, for notification to be given after the birth of a child and not before … If the employer then wishes to know the employee's intention, a letter should be sent to her not earlier than six weeks after the date of expected confinement."</p></blockquote>
We say the time should be not earlier than seven weeks. Therefore, I must advise my hon. Friends to vote against the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have considerable respect for the hon. and learned Gentleman's skills in presenting a case. But I must say that if he were representing me in a court of law and presenting the case as he did on the amendment, I envisage the judge putting on his black cap at a pretty early stage in the proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman would have a very good ground of appeal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may be. I might win an appeal.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman began by saying that it was not the Government's intention to act in a way that would affect adversely the rights of working women. He said that it would be wrong on moral and economic grounds and that it would be plain stupid. He acknowledged that Opposition Members would expect the Government to be wrong on moral and economic grounds but he did not think that we would accuse them of being plain stupid. But I am sorry that I have to disappoint him on that because in his speech he displayed extraordinary stupidity.<br><br>
There is no alternative but to dwell on the question of the evidence. The Under Secretary quoted three sources, but I will

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1149</span>
mention two, the first of which is the Low Pay Unit. My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) demonstrated the fallacy of the argument in support of which the Low Pay Unit was quoted. The unit's case was against the Government's proposals. It is true that he extracted a little from what it said to help him along, but if he was contending that this was a fairly important plank on which to base his proposals in this legislation, I remind him that the evidence from the Low Pay Unit dropped on our plates only within the last couple of days. So it is a little odd of him to cite it in evidence in a big way as contributing much to his case.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary also quoted the Equal Opportunities Commission. I will not dwell unduly on what he said there except to repeat, as he said, that its comment on the 6 weeks period after confinement was in the context of no prior notification. But if he pursues the line that the Equal Opportunities Commission, on one point, appears to be, on the face of it, somewhat supportive of his case, I hope that he will accept the EOC view on various other points that we shall be making on clauses 10 and 11. If he could give me that assurance, I might pay more regard to his remarks on the earlier point.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman referred, as he frequently does, to his constituency postbag. I do not go as far as to accuse the hon. and learned Gentleman of misleading us, and I do not say that he has not had any letters of the kind he suggests. But I wonder how many such letters he, or any member of the Committee, has had. I can only say that I represent a constituency with a large number of small firms—in fact there are very few large firms within it—and I have not had one letter about this from any employer in my constituency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend leaves the various pieces of evidence that the Under-Secretary adduced, may I remind him that the hon. and learned Gentleman rested on evidence provided by the Association of British Chambers of Commerce? Will my hon. Friend take it from me that that statement by the association was not based on surveys of member companies; it was merely the<i>ipse dixit</i> of the professional lobbyists employed by the association and by other chambers of commerce.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1150</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. I was about to make the point that the hon. and learned Gentleman's quotation from the letter from the Association of British Chambers of Commerce was a selective one. But even if he had gone on, he could not have produced any statistical evidence or real facts about any survey that it conducted to support him.<br><br>
To return to the point about constituency postbags, if any of my right hon. and hon. Friends who have received such letters pressing on this matter cares to interrupt me to give details, I shall be delighted. I suspect that the silence will be deafening. I doubt whether any hon. Member opposite can give much, if any, evidence of this kind, either.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had something in my postbag from the Royal College of Nursing, which I presume knows something about these matters, saying that
<br><blockquote><p>"The RCN doubts the necessity of giving employers the right to require additional written notice of intention to return soon after confinement—a time of uncertainty—and therefore opposes Clause 10 Subsection (2)."</p></blockquote>
That is all that I have had in my postbag on the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I refer briefly to the point made by the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Madel) about the explanations that would be needed to get the clause across. He thought that employers would be responsible and would do their best to get the case across, and that the unions should also play a part in that.<br><br>
On the face of it, that sounds very reasonable and persuasive. But, once again, to a very considerable extent, though by no means exclusively, we are dealing with the smaller firms, where the women in the work force are predominantly employed. As I have pointed out on previous occasions, that sector is to a very large extent unorganised. Employers find great difficulty—this is not a condemnation of them, as one recognises their difficulties—in understanding legislation of this kind. As I have said, the same difficulty occurs in understanding the implications of the various Wages Council requirements, and it will certainly apply here. This, again, is borne out by surveys, which show that to a large extent employers are not aware of many of the provisions of legislation in this matter, and that employees are also not

taking it up in anything like the numbers that one would expect if they were familiar with it. The hon. Gentleman should therefore bear that in mind.<br><br>
We have not been given any adequate evidence. We are totally under whelmed, if I may so put it, by the evidence produced to support this change. f the Government wish to make changes, it is for them to make the case. They have failed signally so to do. Moreover, I put it to the hon. Gentleman in all seriousness that if the employee has the longer period of 18 weeks in which to decide, that should give more certainty to the employer that the employee</span></p>

Otherwise, an increasing number of women, if they understand the legislation, are likely to opt for the safeguard and to say that they will return, even if they do not actually intend to do so. I therefore believe that our proposal will be helpful both to the employer and to the employee, because it will increase certainty rather than uncertainty.</p>
