New Clause 21</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
CONTRACTS OF EMPLOYMENT OF DIRECTORS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>'.—(1) Subject to subsection (6) below, a company shall not incorporate in any agreement a term to which this section applies unless the term is first approved by a resolution of the company in general meeting and, in the case of a director of a holding company, by a resolution of that company in general meeting.</p>
<p>(2) This section applies to any term by which a director's employment with the company of which he is the director or, where he is the director of a holding company, his employment within the group is to continue, or may be continued, otherwise than at the instance of the company (whether under the original agreement or under a new agreement entered into in pursuance of the original agreement), for a period exceeding five years during which the agreement—
<ol>
<li>cannot be terminated by the company by notice; or</li>
<li>can be so terminated only in specified circumstances.</li></ol></p>
<p>(3) In any case where—
<ol>
<li>a person employed with a company under an agreement which cannot be terminated by the company by notice or can be so terminated only in specified circumstances; and</li>
<li>more than six months before the expiration of the period for which he is so employed, the company enters into a further agreement (otherwise than a pursuance of a right conferred by or by virtue of the original agreement on the other party thereto) under which his employment with the company or, where he is a director of a holding company, within the group is to be continued or may be continued otherwise than at the instance of the company,</li></ol>
subsection (2) above shall apply as if to the period for which he is to be employed under the later agreement there were added a further period equal to the unexpired period of the original agreement.</p>
<p>(4) A resolution of a company approving a term to which this section applies shall not be passed at a general meeting of the company unless a written memorandum setting out the agreement incorporating the term is available for inspection, by members of the company both—
<ol>
<li>at the registered office of the company for not less than the period of 15 days ending with the date of the meeting; and</li>
<li>at the meeting itself.</li></ol></p>
<p>(5) A term Incorporated in an agreement in contravention of this section shall to the extent that it contravenes this section be void; but instead the agreement shall be deemed to contain a term entitling the company to terminate the agreement at any time by the giving of reasonable notice.</p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 404</span>
<p>(6) No approval is required to be given under this section by any body corporate unless it is a company within the meaning of the 1948 Act or registered under Part VIII of that Act or if it is, for the purposes of section 150 of that Act, a wholly owned subsidiary of any body corporate, wherever incorporated.—[<i>Mr. Eyre.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Question proposed</i>[<i>27 November</i>], That the clause be read a Second time.</p>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Reginald Eyre)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be of assistance to the Committee if I draw attention to the fact that explanatory notes on the Government new clauses are available to members of the Committee. A special note is included relating to the insider dealing clauses, which explains the differences, and those differences we believe are improvements which have been made, following consultations, between the clauses tabled and the proposals set out in the consultative document which was widely circulated on 22 October. I believe that the notes will be helpful to the Committee.<br><br>
When the Committee adjourned on Tuesday I was replying to the points raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) and my hon. Friends the Members for Fulham (Mr. Stevens) and for Dorset, North (Mr. Baker), who were all worried about the implications of Government's new clause 21, particularly for small companies. My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby cited the case of a small company run by a gifted entrepreneur which needed more capital in order to develop further, while the entrepreneur wished to retain the security of a long-term contract of employment.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Fulham also mentioned the case of a merger or takeover in which the board of one company may wish to agree to the merger only if the managing director can be guaranteed a long-term renewal of his service contract.<br><br>
I feel that some of these comments may be based on a misunderstanding of the intended effect of the new clause. Therefore, I wish first to explain that our new clause does not in any way demand the re-approval of any existing service contract between the company and any of its directors. In the case cited by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby, a company
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0224">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 405</span>
wishing to issue more shares in the circumstances he mentioned may, prior to such a move, enter into a long-term service agreement with any of its directors. Provided that this agreement has been approved in the proper manner, the company cannot subsequently deprive any such director of his contractual rights. I hope that my right hon. Friend agrees that meets the point he made.<br><br>
The same argument applies to a company agreeing to a merger, by which I assume my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham to mean the normal United Kingdom practice whereby the share capital of one company is acquired by another, thus rendering the first company a subsidiary of the second. I am glad that my hon. Friend raised the case of a merger as this provides one of the best illustrations of the mischief which the new clause is designed to prevent. It is precisely during the period in which a merger is expected that an unscrupulously self-interested director may try to arrange for himself a long-term employment contract, often in the knowledge that the new owners of the company will wish to terminate his employment, thus entitling himself to extra compensation, which will normally be proportional to the length of the term of the contract.<br><br>
I wish to make clear that if the shareholders give approval, as I have explained, then, all other things being equal, his contract will be fully binding on the company, even when it becomes a subsidiary.<br><br>
I should emphasise that new clause 21 does not prohibit long-term service contracts for directors. I believe that that was the basic anxiety expressed by my right hon. and hon. Friends. All it does is to require that any such long-term contracts must come before the general meeting of the company for approval. Our intention is to protect the interests of shareholders from the actions of self-interested directors seeking to extend their contracts against the long-term interests of the company.<br><br>
The requirement to gain the approval of the general meeting for a service contract would not, however, represent a serious obstacle to any honest director in whom the shareholders have confidence. We are therefore convinced that our clause achieves the proper balance necessary to prevent the abuse of their position by the small minority of un-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 406</span>
scrupulous directors, without interfering with normal and proper business practice.<br><br>
I wish also to comment on the suggestion put by my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North that we should consider restricting the application of the new clause to public companies. While accepting the point that the shareholders of such companies are likely to be less aware than those of private companies of the actions—and, in rare cases, possible misdemeanours—of their directors and therefore are in greater need of protection, we believe that the arguments that I have outlined apply to private as well to public companies.<br><br>
The requirement that we place on companies to seek approval of all long-term agreements in general meeting is reasonable and not particularly onerous. I hope that, on reflection, my right hon. and hon. Friends will agree with that. We do not believe that private companies should feel any need for such exemption.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will know that we do not dissent from the general proposition that he is advancing. However, I ask him to consider two points, to which he may be intending to come. Subsection (2)(<i>a</i>)states that an agreement
<br><blockquote><p>"cannot be terminated by the company by notice…"</p></blockquote>
Notice is not defined; nor was it defined in our Bill.<br><br>
That is something which should 'be examined. However, in subsection (5) it is qualified by the word "reasonable".<br><br>
In any event, would not the objective be achieved—I am not seeking to spell out the precise form of words now—of preventing avoidance of our purpose here by using an enormously long period of notice, by our importing into subsection (2)(<i>a</i>) the phrase" not exceeding six months" and in subsection (5) defining notice as" not in excess of 12 months"? Would not that strengthen the purpose that we are trying jointly to achieve?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think, with respect, that the hon. Gentleman's suggestions may give rise to requirements which are rather too specific in the wide range of circumstances in which the clause would apply. The hon. Gentleman should consider whether the provisions of the clause, taken against the background of the general business practice that I have described, is already
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0225">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 407</span>
adequately met by our proposals, without our imposing too many detailed requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a detailed requirement, but I think it important to get the effect of the notice right and I only ask the hon. Gentleman to look at it. I have not tabled an amendment for the reasons I adumbrated previously. I ask the hon. Gentleman simply to look at it between now and Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Despite what I have just said to the hon. Gentleman, I had intended to say that we shall be glad to consider the point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not convinced by my hon. Friend's argument, which seems to be that if one jumps the gun one can destroy the principle of this clause altogether. If a company enters into a long-term service agreement with a director, provided that it does so before seeking to raise any further capital and before that director disposes of more than 50 per cent. of his holding, that is quite all right. This seems to be, as it were, a blessing on a company in respect of something which is otherwise made into some sort of company sin. I regard it as an extraordinary argument that new clause 21 is right in certain circumstances but is wrong in principle if someone is clever enough to think it may catch him at a later date and he enters into an agreement beforehand.<br><br>
I still consider this to be a most damaging clause to the development of a small company, and I again press my hon. Friend to consider that it should at least be restricted to public companies. An alternative I should like to see, if we must have it at all, would be, perhaps, to restrict it to public listed companies, or there is the further alternative that it might be restricted to relevant companies as defined in new clause 36, which we shall come to later. I do not want to go through all the arguments again. I had hoped that my hon. Friend would look at this and reduce the effect of the new clause on the development of small private companies.<br><br>
Before I sit down, I must point to two defects in drafting—or perhaps something more than that. Under subsection (4) there has to be a resolution of the company approving the possible offensive term before the resolution is passed by the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 408</span>
general meeting of the company, and there has to be
<br><blockquote><p>"a written memorandum setting out the agreement incorporating the term."</p></blockquote>
That written memorandum has to be
<br><blockquote><p>"available for inspection by members of the company."</p></blockquote>
From that I assume that it is the completed agreement which has to be on show. But then one seems to be putting the cart before the horse, because we read in subsection (1):
<br><blockquote><p>"a company shall not incorporate in any agreement a term to which this section applies unless the term is first approved by a resolution of the company in general meeting."</p></blockquote>
It looks as though, if subsection (4) means anything at all, it should be a draft agreement which is made available for inspection. It cannot be an agreement with the contravening term in it; otherwise, it is in contravention of subsection (1).<br><br>
The second point which I believe needs clearing up is in subsection (5), where there is a provision that I find rather peculiar in its wording:
<br><blockquote><p>"A term incorporated in an agreement in contravention of this section shall to the extent that it contravenes this section be void."</p></blockquote>
So it is the term in the agreement that is void. One, as it were, extracts the offensive term from the agreement. If the contract is for, say, 10 years, one extracts that because it is void. The rest of subsection (5) then provides:
<br><blockquote><p>"but instead the agreement shall be deemed to contain a term entitling the company to terminate the agreement at any time by the giving of reasonable notice."</p></blockquote>
I stress the words "at any time".<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
Would it not be more reasonable to say that the agreement shall stand, as the law allows, for five years but that at any time after that permissible period it shall be determinable by reasonable notice? Otherwise, if one is inadvertent enough, or if one fails to get the resolution of the company in general meeting, if the contract specifies a term of 10 years' service for the director it has to go altogether. It cannot be amended to what would otherwise be valid if one had thought of it first, namely, the five years. I should like to see at the end of subsection (5) a provision cutting out the phrase "at any time" and providing for the giving of reasonable notice after five years.<br><br>
I join the hon. Member for Hackney,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0226">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 409</span>
Central (Mr. Davis) on the question of being a little more specific about the notice. I am sure that everyone knows the kind of litigation which arises over whether reasonable notice has been given to terminate a contract. It depends so much upon the status, the intelligence or the know-how of the person concerned, and perhaps also on the narrowness of the person's opening for further employment, and so on. Reasonable notice is a very indefinite matter because it depends so much on the person involved.<br><br>
I believe that litigation would be avoided if the provision were made specific. It is nice to think that it might be flexible. I declare an interest here, of course. I personally enjoy litigation of that kind. Nevertheless, it is not good for the public, and I believe that to be specific would avoid considerable litigation.<br><br>
I come back to may main point. I do not like the new clause at all, but if it were restricted to private companies I should be repared to put up with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the new clause we are beginning to tackle something in the nature of a new modern bible of conduct for directors and senior executives which the Department has worked on and which it is proposed to incorporate in company law. This is the first long, specific and very detailed clause of many which have appeared on the Notice Paper over the past two or three weeks. Clearly, as a Committee, we shall not be able to deal with them with the thoroughness they deserve. I certainly am not competent to examine them line by line, as possibly they should be examined if Parliament is to incorporate them in the body of our company law.<br><br>
I am not happy about the detail of the provisions of new clause 21, but that may be simply because I have not devoted to it the weeks of analysis that it clearly requires if one is to think of all the circumstances in which it might apply and to analyse precisely whether it is exactly what is required in every single case.<br><br>
I shall not vote against the new clause being incorporated in company law. But neither shall I vote for it. I think that there is a fundamental disagreement between myself and the Department on the way in which the problem of the British limited liability company ought to be tackled. The anxieties expressed by my right hon. Friend
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 410</span>
the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) show that one ought to hesitate before trying to tackle the reform of the practice of boards of directors in the particular way that the Department recommends here.<br><br>
I am sure that we all—both sides of the Committee, on both Front and Back Benches—agree that we need to do more about the supervision of top management. Once again, 1 do not have to emphasise how many times I have made speeches drawing attention to the need for better supervision of top management. But when we look at a clause like this, the wads of following clauses, and the inscrutably complex detail proposed by the Department, we must ask ourselves whether we should do it in the way that the Department recommends, or whether there is not a better way.<br><br>
The Department, in effect, recommends that we should hand over the supervision of top management, in private and in public companies, to officials—to the police, to fraud squad officers, and to others outside the company. All these people may be admirable judges of the conduct of directors, but there are so many problem companies in this country, and so many special situations that I do not believe that all this mass of legislation will be enforceable. Even if it is, it will simply lead to months and months of litigation. People who know how to read clauses like this and find the loopholes in them will bend their ingenuity to finding ever more complex ways of advising their clients how they can get around the provisions of the Act.<br><br>
I believe that the Department is leading the House of Commons down the wrong road in company law reform in trying to persuade us to adopt page after page of codes of conduct for directors. There must be another way which is more practical and more likely to be effective. I think that, at the end of the day, we shall have to let the people who are engaged in our private and public companies decide for themselves what is needed, what is proper, and what is in the interests of the company in different circumstances.<br><br>
We have had limited liability companies in this country for a century or more, but we have not needed this mass of legislation to guide the conduct of directors until now. Now we feel the need for something. There have been all too many scandals, misdemeanours and questionable affairs. The public is very much concerned. But I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0227">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 411</span>
am much more concerned about the engine of the vehicle of private enterprise than I am about the paintwork.<br><br>
I know that there are blemishes, and that they are vexatious—there have been unpleasant revelations about the way in which some of our very largest companies have been conducted, as well as the small ones which might normally have expected to escape notice—but 1 do not believe that this whole series of clauses that we are being asked to hurry on to the statute book will do anything to improve the efficiency of free enterprise. It will simply create not hundreds but thousands of new jobs for people who will add nothing to the nation's wealth but will be merely looking over the shoulders of those who are trying to run our companies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Trade (Mr. Cecil Parkinson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend, very unusually for him, is grossly overstating his case. When frauds have been revealed, and totally undesirable practices have come to the attention of the public, at the very time when we are trying to persuade the small shareholder that he must start to take a share in public companies, to leave such shareholders feeling totally exposed to crooks, knowing that there are practices available for crooks to defraud them, and to say that the Government are doing the wrong thing in pinpointing criminal offences and pointing out to people that if they commit them they could find themselves in gaol, is quite unacceptable to me.<br><br>
It would be infinitely worse if, knowing that there were great flaws and gaps in our company law, we sat back and did nothing, because that would totally discredit the system in which hon. Friends and I believe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is not being quite fair to me if he thinks that I am recommending that we should sit back and do nothing about company law. Ever since joining the House, in every Session I have tried to draw the attention of my colleagues to the urgent need to do something about the reform of company law and, in particular, the supervision of top management. I should feel a sense of bitter regret if I thought that all that I and others who want reform of company had been able to achieve was the addition of scores of almost unreadable clauses
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 412</span>
to the Companies Bill, which will never be enforced—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They will be enforced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—or enforced only in part, at the same time as bringing in hundreds of well-informed people to supervise free enterprise instead of getting on with the job.<br><br>
In many of the cases that my hon. Friend and his able officials are aiming at, the problems would be solved if there was an audit committee of independent directors assisted by those highly professional people, the auditors, to whom, fortunately, we are able to turn. An audit committee of three or so independent directors in these companies would do far more to ensure that senior executives behaved according to accepted rules of propriety and professional conduct than would a hundred new clauses in the Companies Bill.<br><br>
I shall not vote against the new clause. I am sure that its intentions are quite right. The Government's proposals probably encapsulate some of the highest ideals of good conduct for directors. But I think that it is a mistake to clutter our company law with umpteen clauses which no one will ever read.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise to ask my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams), who has just spoken so eloquently, whether he sees a distinction between, on the one hand, rules governing the conduct of company directors that prevent them from doing, or punish them for doing, things that they should not do and, on the other, what I feel is really behind his contribution to company law reform—namely, a desire to make directors more efficient and more productive. They seem to be two completely different things.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to withdraw my closing remark to the effect that no one would ever read these clauses. A certain number of people will be obliged to read them in order to find ways round them, others will read them carefully in order to enforce them, and we shall have an army of unproductive people on the back of free enterprise.<br><br>
Naturally, I am concerned about efficiency. That is why I talk about the engine, which is what is the matter with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0228">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 413</span>
the creation of wealth in this country. We do not have enough driving power, enough efficiency, in the machine on which we depend for our standard of living. To load the whole vehicle with quantities of passengers who are attending to the appearance of free enterprise and not getting on with the actual creation of wealth is a mistake.<br><br>
Clearly, there are two sides to the work of a supervisory board, an audit committee, a non-executive director or whatever. Naturally, it is they who must see that the company is working efficiently, and they must also ensure that the board is acting properly. That is the function of a supervisory board.<br><br>
I said earlier that there have been limited liability companies for a long time but it is only lately that we have felt the need to do more to improve the quality of supervision. Only lately has the character of British boards changed. Before the war, the majority of British boards, as in the United States, were made up of outside directors who felt themselves to have a supervisory role and who knew that their responsibility was to the shareholders. They were not involved day to day in the running of the business; they watched it from board level outside the execution of the actual business of the company.<br><br>
All that has changed. There has been a managerial revolution, and the supervisory element has become so weak that in the majority of companies it is not effective. So there has been a crop of scandals, which is what one might expect. But do we deal with that by trying to pass into company law more and more clauses of great complexity, or do we try to find some way of rectifying the balance of forces within the company so that the supervisory element has once again the authority it needs?</span></p>
<p>11 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find the hon. Gentleman's attitude this morning somewhat inconsistent. When I inadvertently referred to the whole panoply of the Government's amendments with which we are having to deal as "plaguing" the Committee, who intervened and referred to the Committee as being" delighted"?—none other than the hon. Gentleman himself.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 414</span>
<p><span class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite certain what it was that I was delighted with. The hon. Gentleman has quoted a passage from my many effusions which I do not recall.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I recall the hon. Gentleman's speeches on the supervisory role of directors in great detail. I hope that he will not repeat them on this clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At any rate, Sir Stephen, I feel that in you I have someone who understands all, and I believe that if you changed places with me you would be making the same speeches as I, because of your great knowledgs and wisdom, in which I have complete confidence.<br><br>
Members of the Committee may think that I have said enough, and you also, Sir Stephen, may think so. I shall not say more unless it is dragged from me, but I hope I have said enough to persuade my hon. Friend to concentrate his energies on looking at ways of improving the balance of power inside a company rather than trying to rectify deficiencies, which we all know exist, by bringing pressure to bear from outside.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In his opening sentences about the main principles in the clause, my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) used the words "If you jump the gun you destroy the principle." With great respect to him, I believe that on further consideration he will agree that that is not so. If the contract which extends the service agreement of the gifted entrepreneur—with whom my right hon. Friend is properly concerned—is entered into before the capital is spread around, the new shareholders will come into the company with their eyes open. They will know the new situation that has been created before they introduce the new extra resources into the company. The contract will exist and will be available for inspection under section 26 of the 1967 Act.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend referred to two extra points, the first being on subsection (4). Here, I would point out that it is not the completed agreement which is on show at the approvals stage but the full terms of the actual agreement to be entered into. A draft agreement will not do; it has to be the terms of the actual agreement.<br><br>
With regard to subsection (5), the second point raised by my right hon. Friend, on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0229">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 415</span>
which he suggested that the agreement should be terminable after five years, the policy is that it should be terminable by reasonable notice <i>ab initio.</i> We prefer this solution, which rewrites the contract so as to apply the reasonable notice period throughout its duration. However, I have noted carefully my right hon. Friend's remarks and I feel that we need to give them further consideration.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend spoke also in support of the matter raised by the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Clinton Davis) relating to more specific notice, on which he posed the question: What is reasonable notice? Before Report, we shall give further consideration to the three points I have discussed, as well as the reference to notice raised by the hon. Member for Hackney, Central.<br><br>
I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) is unhappy. He spoke of pages of new clauses. As he knows, we try to give close attention and consideration to the pages of new clauses which he introduces on occasion. We are endeavouring to take account of the principles which my hon. Friend enunciates.</span></p>

New Clause 22</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
SUBSTANTIAL PROPERTY TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING DIRECTORS, ETC.</div> <!-- title -->
<p>"(1) A company shall not enter into an arrange-ment—
<ol>
<li>whereby it or another person transfers to any person who is a director of the company or its holding company or is connected with such a director any non-cash asset of the requisite value belonging to the company or in which the company has a beneficial interest; or</li>
<li>whereby a person who is such a director or is so connected transfers to the company or a person nominated by it any non-cash asset of the requisite value;</li></ol>
unless the arrangement is first approved by a resolution of the company in general meeting and, if the director or connected person is a director of its holding company or a person connected with such a director, by a resolution in general meeting of the holding company.</p>
<p>(2) For the purposes of this section a non-cash asset is of the requisite value if at the time the arrangement in question is entered into its value is not less than £I,000 but, subject to that, exceeds
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 416</span>
£50,000 or ten per cent. of the amount of the company's relevant assets, and for these purposes the amount of a company's relevant assets is
<ol>
<li>except in a case falling within paragraph (<i>b</i>) below, the value of its net assets determined by reference to the accounts prepared and laid under section 1 of the 1976 Act in respect of the last preceding accounting reference period in respect of which such accounts were so laid;</li>
<li>where no accounts have been prepared and laid under that section before that time, the amount of its called-up share capital.</li></ol></p>
<p>(3) An arrangement entered into by a company in contravention of this section and any transaction entered into in pursuance of the arrangement (whether by the company or any other person) shall be voidable at the instance of the company unless—
<ol>
<li>restitution of any money or any other asset which is the subject-matter of the arrangement or transaction is no longer possible or the company or the person nominated by it has been indemnified in pursuance of subsection (4)(<i>b</i>) below by any other person for the loss or damage suffered by it; or</li>
<li>any rights acquired bona fide for value and without notice of the contravention by any person who is not a party to the arrangement or transaction would be affected by its avoidance; or</li>
<li>the arrangement is, within a reasonable period, affirmed by the company in general meeting and, if it is an arrangement for the transfer of an asset to or by a director of its holding company or a person who is connected with such a director, is so affirmed with the approval of the holding company given by a resolution in general meeting.</li></ol></p>
<p>(4) Without prejudice to any liability imposed otherwise than by this subsection, where an arrangement or transaction is entered into with a company or a person nominated by it by a director of the company or its holding company or a person connected with him in contravention of this section, that director and the person so connected, and any other director of the company who authorised the arrangement or transaction, shall (whether or not it has been avoided in pursuance of subsection (3) above) be liable—
<ol>
<li>to account to the company or the person so nominated for any gain which he had made directly or indirectly by the arrangement or transaction; and</li>
<li>(jointly and severally with any person liable under this subsection) to indemnify the company and any person so nominated for any loss or damage resulting from the arrangement or transaction;</li></ol>
but a person so connected and any such other director shall not be so liable if he shows that, at the time the arrangement was entered into, he did not know the relevant circumstances constituting the contravention.</p>
<p>(5) No approval is required to be given under this section by any body corporate unless it is a company within the meaning of the 1948 Act or registered under Part VIII of that Act or, if it is, for the purposes of section 150 of that Act, a wholly-owned subsidiary of any body corporate, wherever incorporated.".—[<i>Mr. Parkinson.</i>]</p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, that the clause be read a Second time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take amendment (a) in the name of the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), in subsection (2), leave out "£50,000 or ten per cent of the amount of the company's relevant assets" and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"£100,000, or ten per cent. of the amount of the company's relevant assets whichever is the less."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I propose to listen to my right hon. Friend's arguments before I deal with his amendment. I think that would be the best way to deal with it.<br><br>
The new clause is an example of what the Government seek to do, but which my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) found objectionable. We hope that once directors know clearly what transactions they may enter into between themselves and the company, without having the approval of a general meeting, it will enable them to carry on their duties with a clearer picture of where they stand. My hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Baker) summed up the position beautifully—that we seek to create greater efficiency in industry, and there is no conflict between that aim and the new clauses.<br><br>
For example, new clause 22 prohibits a company from transferring, without the approval of the general meeting, any substantial property between itself and a director, or a person or company connected with a director, of that company or of its holding company.<br><br>
We have made a few changes to the provision as originally introduced by the previous Government, but it is basically the same clause, although marginally improved. The changes are straightforward. Nominee intermediaries are now covered, as well as connected persons of directors, and subsidiaries' dealings with holding company directors are also covered. Otherwise, it is basically the clause as introduced by the previous Government.<br><br>
The two prohibitions dealt with by the clause refer to property transactions both to and from a director or connected person, and are set out in subsection (1). We refer to an "arrangement" for the transfer of property rather than a "contract" as the term "arrangement" provides wider coverage in that it includes agreements other than contracts; that is, other than those which are enforceable
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 418</span>
at law. By using the word "arrangement" we aim to catch a range of transactions which the wily might otherwise have been able to devise to get round the word "contract"<br><br>
This clause applies only to non-cash assets, defined in clause 56 as
<br><blockquote><p>"any property or interest in property other than cash"</p></blockquote>
but not including the release of a liability for a liquidated sum.<br><br>
Subsection (2) provides a sliding scale threshold or de minimis provision for this clause which is necessary as it is not considered essential to require the approval of shareholders for relatively minor transactions. Subsection (2) defines the range of transactions, puts a money value on them, and states the range of transactions which have to be disclosed and approved by the general meeting.<br><br>
Subsection (3) provides the company with a civil remedy in cases of contravention of the clause. Any such arrangement contravening this clause is voidable, with the three exceptions set out—voidable, I must say, at the instance of the company. These three important exceptions are: where the restitution of the asset is no longer possible, or where the party suffering loss has been indemnified for it; where an innocent third party whose bona fide rights would be affected by the avoidance of the arrangement is involved; and when the approval of the company in general meeting is obtained" within a reasonable period "of the transaction. We think that those three important exceptions should be included in the Bill.<br><br>
In addition, subsection (4) provides that a company, or the company's nominee, will also have a right of action against the director or connected person who made the arrangement and against any director who authorised the arrangement. Any person liable under this subsection must account to the company, or a person nominated by it, for any gain made by virtue of the prohibited arrangement, and must indemnify the relevant party for any loss. Such indemnification would, of course, be reduced if restitution of the asset provided for in subsection (3) had already occurred.<br><br>
Persons connected with directors and directors authorising the arrangement are, however, absolved from liability if they can show that they were not aware of the circumstances which placed the arrangement in breach of this provision.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0231">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 419</span>
The remedies provided under the subsections are to a large extent based on the remedies that are available under common law and equitable principles, where a fiduciary is in breach of his duty, and, in my view, they achieve a fair balance between the need to ensure that the company is adequately protected in the event of failure to observe the rules laid down in this clause and the need to avoid injustice to third parties who enter into normal transactions in good faith.<br><br>
The scope of the clause is limited, as is that of new clause 21, to Companies Act companies. All wholly-owned subsidiaries of any type of company are excluded, as control of the directors of such subsidiaries is in the hands of the directors of the holding company. Disclosure provisions relating to this clause are contained in new clauses 28, 29, 32 and 33, so detailed explanation and discussion of them should, I suggest, be delayed until those clauses are reached.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a number of points to make on new clause 22, and I have an amendment to the clause to be moved in due course. First, I refer to the matter with which my hon. Friend dealt near the beginning of his address, that is, the use of the word "arrangement". It is a vague term. It is used in other new clauses, but it is not defined. I appreciate the purpose of its use, namely to overcome the difficulty of something being done outside a firm legal agreement, but I must point out that it causes problems in phrases that are used later in the clause.<br><br>
If there is a firm agreement, one knows its date and the parties to it. The date of an agreement is when it becomes binding, and the parties to the agreement are those who are bound by it. But that is not so with an arrangement. Therefore, it is difficult to interpret the various phrases referring to the time the arrangement was entered into, the parties to the arrangement, and so on. Those phrases occur in the second part of the clause, and I believe that they may cause a little difficulty unless they are sorted out.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
I come now to the definition of a non-cash asset and its requisite value. In clause 56(2)(b), non-cash asset is defined. I presume that in this case—since we are dealing particularly with property transactions—it includes a lease, although it is a little difficult to see how the definition in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 420</span>
clause 56, as it is applied in new clause 22, includes a lease. However, from the whole purpose of the clause I would have thought that it must include a lease. We may have to return to that when considering new clause 23.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Minister said, this clause applies only to non-cash assets and if those that are the subject of the transaction attacked by the new clause exceed a certain value, the arrangement, if it is to be validated, must be validated by a general meeting. If we are to put the requisite value at an insignificant amount for some companies, we really must think about the cost of calling a general meeting to validate something which is quite insignificant. That is the purpose of my amendment, if I may refer to that. According to the new clause, the requisite value must exceed £50,000. That may be significant for a small company, but it may be quite insignificant for a large company.<br><br>
The important point is, of course, the materiality of the transaction to the particular company that one is considering. If one has the long-stop of 10 per cent. of the relevant assets, I think that the other figure could be put to £100,000 and not left at £50,000.<br><br>
It seems more realistic at present, given the size of some companies, to use the figure of £100,000. After all, the title to new clause 22 is:
<br><blockquote><p>"Substantial property transactions involving directors, etc."</p></blockquote>
I stress the word "substantial". I see no great danger in increasing the figure to £100,000 if one has what I call the long-stop of 10 per cent. of the relevant assets. It would save the cost of convening a general meeting which is extremely expensive for some big companies. That is the amendment which I hope to move in due course.<br><br>
My other worry about the new clause is the position of a purchaser. We are dealing with property transactions, and a property may change hands a considerable number of times after a transaction that the clause might invalidate.<br><br>
Subsection (3) of new clause 22 provides:
<br><blockquote><p>"An arrangement entered into by a company in contravention of this section … shall be voidable at the instance of the company unless "—</p></blockquote>
we then come to subsection (3)(b)—
<br><blockquote><p>"any rights acquired bona fide for value and without notice of the contravention by any person who is not a party to the arrangement or transaction would be affected by its avoidance".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0232">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 421</span>
What is notice? In so many such transactions, in law the person who to ought, if he had taken care, to have had notice may be deemed to have had that notice. One can refer to that in legal shorthand as constructive notice.<br><br>
In dealing with a transaction in land, is it "notice" to any subsequent purchaser that a transaction has occurred between a company and some person? Ought the person subsequently dealing with that land to say that before he has a good title to the land he must know whether the person dealing with the company who once held the land was a director at the time the company entered into the transaction with him? Even worse, he may have to find out whether that person was a connected person in some way and connected with a director. Is he saddled with "notice" if he merely finds that sort of transaction on the title?<br><br>
If the transaction is to be validated so as to form a proper link in the title to the property, the company has to affirm it. There has to be an affirmative resolution. Does that affirmative resolution become a document of title? Must a purchaser, at any time in the future, ensure that the person was not a director or, if he was, that the company affirmed the transaction in general meeting and not only affirmed it, but affirmed it, according to subsection (3<i>c</i>), "within a reasonable period"?<br><br>
It will be extremely difficult even for a person who purchases directly from, say, the director who has entered into the transaction, even if it is obvious that it is one of the dealings that are to be prohibited by the new clause. The purchaser will be asking himself whether a period of, say, three months between the transaction and the general meeting affirming the transaction would be considered by the court to be a" reasonable period."<br><br>
Whether provisions could be drafted to make the position easier for people dealing with property, I cannot say. But without such provisions, difficulties will certainly arise on subsequent transactions. Apparently the agreement or arrangement remains avoidable during the period before it is affirmed. But if it is affirmed only after a "reasonable period" has expired, does it for ever remain voidable? That is a serious objection to the clause as drafted. Perhaps we could put in a provision that it is voidable only
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 422</span>
for a certain period of time. At any rate, there is that difficulty running through subsection (3).<br><br>
What is notice? And what has to be considered by a person subsequently dealing with the property? Those are the points that I wish raise on the question of the position of the purchaser or of a person dealing with the property after such a transaction.<br><br>
The only other point that I wish to raise at the moment is the question of the connected person. An arrangement that contravenes this clause could be entered into with a connected person without the director concerned, or any other director, being aware that there was a connection between the connected person and a director of the company. To take a far-fetched example, a director may be estranged from his wife, who may then change her name by deed poll and have a transaction with the company. It is quite possible that neither he nor any other director, when seeing the name of the person carrying out the transaction, would have the slightest clue that the director was connected with her.<br><br>
I have taken an unusual example, but I could think of others that would be far more usual. Take, for example, the case of trustees of a trust and the beneficiaries that are concerned under it. Those circumstances must occur frequently. My submission is that no one who does not actually know of the relevant circumstances should be liable. Furthermore, the clause should specifically empower the court to give relief, as does clause 36. There should b3e actual knowledge of the connection between the persons involved, and relief should be allowed for anyone who has not acted deliberately in contravention of the provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) has raised a number of points which have been put to the Committee largely by the Law Society, or perhaps by the Law Society of Scotland. They are all serious matters. I do not go along with the right hon. Gentleman in his amendment concerning the figure of £100,000, but he has illustrated the difficulty with which the Committee yet again is presented.<br><br>
I wish that the Government had availed themselves of the offer that I put to them on Second Reading, namely that they should pause a little and come back to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0233">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 423</span>
the Committee in February or March, when everybody would have had the opportunity to look at the position afresh. The Government would have been able to put down their new clauses then, rather than now.<br><br>
Although I certainly do not object to the fact that the Government have put down their new clauses—indeed, I very much welcome that—the whole situation is fraught with problems. We shall inevitably be faced with a long Report stage. That will have to be the case—and the Under-Secretary has already acknowledged that he is in favour of that—if we are to do justice to such important matters affecting the reform of company law.<br><br>
I have relatively few questions about the clause at this stage. However, the points raised by the right hon. Gentleman give me cause for considerable concern. It may well be that the Government will wish to consider further amendments between now and the Report stage. That is the burden of my complaint. It is not new, but I wish that the Government had listened to me. I was not seeking to make any party political issue out of the matter, and I believe that that was acknowledged at the time by the Minister.<br><br>
I wonder whether, in seeking to accomplish their objective in new clause 22—with which most of us would agree—the Government are satisfied that they have managed to do that legally. In a sense, I suppose that I am also querying whether I did that when I was in office. But we have had further time to contemplate the matter and I hope that nobody will set his mind against making amendments, or will assert that we must have as final the words on the Amendment Paper.<br><br>
In particular, I query whether the wording covers the sale to, or purchase from, a company controlled by the director in question or his family or one in which he or they have a substantial beneficial interest. Again, it may be that the Minister will not be able to give a totally clear answer today. I do not object to that—he may write to me if he prefers.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
Subsection (3) of new clause 22 provides:
<br><blockquote><p>"An arrangement entered into by a company in contravention of this section and any transaction entered into in pursuance of the arrangement (whether by the company or any other person) shall be voidable at the instance of the company."</p></blockquote>
I wonder whether it should not also be voidable at the instance of a petitioner,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 424</span>
petitioning under clause 47, if the court thinks fit in the particular circumstances. I believe that the Minister should give that his attention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin Stevens</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that we are all growing uneasy as our passage through the Bill proceeds. We all have such good intentions, yet the tighter we seek to tie the provisions, the more loopholes come to my mind. I wish to confine myself to two points for consideration by my hon. Friend the Minister for Trade.<br><br>
The first has already been referred to—the financial provisions of subsection (2). They are stated as absolute provisions, but will clearly get out of date very quickly, if they are not already out of date. I suggest that some qualifying phrase should be added.<br><br>
My second point, which is perhaps of more substance, is that we are talking about company directors, their dependants or connections. Will we not find that in the company where this sort of impropriety occurs the individuals concerned will cease to be directors and become consultants or something of that nature? They will still attend board meetings and influence proceedings, but they will circumvent the letter of the law. Should we not seek to meet that point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I think that he should bear in mind that under company law the rules relating to directors apply not only to directors, but to those who act in the position of directors. It is probable that those acting as my hon. Friend suggested, in the guise of consultants or <i>eminences grises,</i> would be deemed to be directors for the purposes of company law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stevens</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, that argument has force. However, having been on the receiving end of so much company legislation of this sort, and having sought to work my way through it as a lay person, I believe that if the sort of individual to which I referred were deemed to be a director for the purpose of the clause, there would be some benefit for those seeking to obey the law if that point were made clear within the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A number of very interesting points have been raised during this debate on the new clause. I say straight away that I accept a number of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0234">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 425</span>
the arguments and I shall point to the areas where we believe that amendment is necessary and where we shall come forward with proposals on Report. I suggest that this is a good example of why we were right to table the new clauses now. If we had come to Report with the new clauses, our opportunities for making the changes which we all know to be necessary would have been limited.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: do not complain about that. Once the Government had themselves in this mess there was no alternative to that, but it would have been far better if we had had an opportunity to pause and consider. The Government could have tabled their new clauses, we could have returned in February or March and given consideration to the matter.<br><br>
No member of the Committee is anxious to hold the Bill up unnecessarily—that is plain. Therefore, all we ask is that the Minister should pause carefully before he embarks on the Report stage, and not rush into it before giving us an opportunity, until, say, March, to consult. It is not only the Government who have to consult.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not want to get involved in party politics, because they have not once raised their ugly head in the Committee. If the Bill had been allowed to go through its Committee stage with its original drafting, things might have been different, but we were sure that if we had not tabled new clauses, they would have been put down by other hon. Members. The hon. Gentleman's point is slightly spurious.<br><br>
I turn to the important points raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page). In my attempt to speed up the Committee's work, I omitted a sentence from my remarks that might have helped in dealing with his first point relating to arrangements. I explained that we used the word "arrangement" for transfer of property rather than "contract" because the term "arrangement" provided wider coverage by including agreements other than contracts—that is, other than those enforceable at law. The combined effect of the use of that word and the references to the company or another person in subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) and to the company or a person nominated by it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 426</span>
in subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) is, we believe, to catch transactions made in pursuance of a deliberate arrangement to circumvent those provisions by the use of a third party as a front for the true party to the transaction. If I had given that rather fuller explanation in my opening remarks, my right hon. Friend might have been a little less unhappy about the use of the word "arrangement"</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not complaining about the use of the word "arrangement" to catch transactions that were not legally enforceable. It is quite right, and I see its great purpose. However, I must go a little further and ask about the time of an arrangement, who are the parties to it, and when it is entered into—the aspects covered by the clause. I know that all that is covered in a legally enforceable contract, but I am in difficulty over how it is dealt with in an arrangement that does not have legal enforceability.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that the expression "arrangement" is used elsewhere on the statute book in restrictive practices legislation, and I am not aware that the courts have had any difficulty in identifying when such arrangements come into being and who are the parties to them. I take the point made by my right hon. Friend and we will give it careful consideration before Report.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend's second point related to whether the definition of a non-cash asset included a lease and whether the transfer of a non-cash asset could include the creation of a lease. I understand that a lease itself is an interest in property and is within the definition in clause 56(1).<br><br>
My right hon. Friend mentioned his amendment and questioned whether the figure of £50,000 was a suitable-sized sum with which to involve a company in the calling of a general meeting. That is a matter of judgment. I think that £50,000 is a considerable figure and that shareholders should be told about a transaction of that size. My right hon. Friend says that £100,000 is a much more worthwhile figure. I can only say that if I were a shareholder in a company I should like to know if there had been a transaction of £50,000 between a director and the company.<br><br>
Under new clause 34 the Secretary of State would have the right to review these figures and to come forward with an order
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0235">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 427</span>
to raise them if necessary. That meets a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Stevens). We accept that to build a figure into the legislation without arrangements for it to be changed would be unsatisfactory. I suggest that we would be wise to let the clause stand and see how it works in practice, knowing that we have the ability to review the figures if necessary.<br><br>
By a strange premonition, it had been anticipated that my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby might have qualms about the degree of notice that a third party must have of any contravention of the relevant provisions before he is deprived of protection against the company rescinding the transaction, and I shall now explain the Government's attitude on this point.<br><br>
We share my right hon. Friend's concern that purchasers will be forced to make enquiries, whenever it appears in a property transaction that a company and its director have been involved, to ascertain that all relevant procedures have been carried out—for example, that a company has passed a valid resolution approving the sale of the property to a director who is now proposing to resell it to a third party.<br><br>
Our objective in these provisions was to ensure that any person who entered into a transaction either with full knowledge of the facts constituting a contravention, or in a reckless manner, not caring whether or not such facts existed, should have no protection. We wish, as does my right hon. Friend, to strike a fair balance between the interests of the company and innocent parties who might be prejudiced if we allowed too wide a power for the company to recover property. I welcome the views of my right hon. Friend, of other members of the Committee and of any other sources about this.<br><br>
We recognise the concern that has been expressed by the Law Society and the CBI that our provisions should not impose unnecessary burdens and costs on the day-to-day conduct of business, particularly in relation to the conveyancing of real property. We shall have further consultations, and I hope that my right hon. Friend will participate, giving the Government the benefit of his views. We shall bring forward on Report any amendments that are deemed necessary as a result.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Consultations between the Minister and his right hon. Friend
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 428</span>
or between him and any member of the Committee are fine, but what we really need to know well in advance of Report are the conclusions that the Government reach after the additional consultations. No one on the Committee will dissent from that, because we shall want to consider those conclusions before Report. Can the Minister be a little more forthcoming, therefore, and say that he will write to individual members of the Committee so that we can pursue the matter more widely after the consultations, not only on this clause but on others which he will consider after this Committee stage?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have just issued a fairly general invitation to members of the Committee who have views to express them to the Government. The Government are ready to consider those views. I hope that members of the Committee, even if they cannot be present, occasionally take a quick look at <i>Hansard.</i> I suggest that those who do not are not showing sufficient enthusiasm for the subject to deserve to receive a letter.<br><br>
However, I say to all members of the Committee and to any other interested bodies that we recognise that there is an important point which the Government wish to meet. We should welcome their views. We shall reveal the Government's thinking in the traditional manner, by tabling our amendments on Report. At that time, the Opposition will have the opportunity to criticise them and to table their own amendments, and we shall have the usual chance to discuss them.</span></p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My concern is that those of us who are lawyers are anxious to receive the right sort of answers so far as possible. I think that that goes for non-lawyer members of the Committee as well. The Bill is not a politically contentious matter.<br><br>
However, unless we know well in advance of Report the general nature of the Government's conclusions, we shall not have an opportunity to consult more widely. The Government are perfectly entitled to do that—I endorse what the hon. Gentleman said about the need to consult widely—but we also have that right. The value of our consultations depends on the conclusions reached by the Government.<br><br>
We all know that amendments can be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0236">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 429</span>
put down shortly before Report and that gives neither the Committee nor the House the opportunity to engage in the sort of consultation to which I have referred.<br><br>
Surely I am not asking too much of the hon. Gentleman in wondering whether, after he has reached a general conclusion on the matter, he will not simply put down amendments for Report but he will write to members of the Committee giving the general nature of his conclusion. Is that a terribly onerous task for the hon. Gentleman? Is it something that he feels to be a party-political point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, and I shall not be provoked into saying that I think that it is coming close to being a waste of time. I shall consider what the hon. Gentleman said. I remind him that, with very few exceptions, the clause is essentially a clause from his Bill. We have not come forward with a revolutionary new clause this morning. In fact, we have just tidied up a clause that has been public knowledge for months now. I accept that the hon. Gentleman is trying to be helpful, and I shall certainly give careful consideration to the point that he made.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend raised a matter, which again has been presented to us by the Law Society, about connected persons. He mentioned the case of a divorced or separated wife who changed her name. We believe that new clause 22(4) makes clear that when a company enters into a transaction for the benefit of a director or a person connected with him it has to be established in relation to such a person that he or she was aware of all the relevant circumstances constituting the contravention before being made liable. Furthermore, any other director who authorised that transaction would be liable, again if it could be proved that he was aware of all the relevant circumstances. Only the director himself would be liable simply by virtue of the fact that the transaction was entered into in contravention of the appropriate provisions. We thought it unlikely that such a person would be unaware of who his connected persons were.<br><br>
I hope that that meets my right hon. Friend's point. There is a carefully defined limit. I believe that the point which he made was a rather fine one and that we have covered it to a considerable extent in clause 22(4).<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 430</span>
The hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) asked whether the clause would cover the sale to, and purchase from, a company in which a director had a substantial interest. I am pleased to tell him that such a person would be a connected person under new clause 35 and would be caught by that clause. He asked about voidability under clause 47. He is quite right in saying that that is already possible under clause 47(3).<br><br>
I hope that I have dealt with all the points that were made. The Government recognise their importance, and on or before Report we shall put down amendments to the clause in at least one or two cases. Thanks to the work of the Committee, it has become clear that they will be necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for the very generous offer that he made to consider, after consultation, what amendments should be made on the points that have been raised. I had the fear in the earlier stages of the debate that the leaders on both sides of the Committee were singing in harmony that song, which I believe was from "Showboat"—I have to adjust the words a little—"I don't know why I love it, but it's just my Bill"! There seemed to be no opposition between the two sides. I am grateful that my hon. Friend has now appreciated that it needs a little amendment here and there.<br><br>
I shall quickly suggest some points for consideration on the question of the notice to those who deal with property. To see that the transaction is valid, they first have to consider the value. We are dealing with a non-cash asset, so that will not be very easy. Are we considering an asset that is valued at more than £50,000? They then have to establish whether the person in the deal was a director or a connected person.<br><br>
One could make a provision that if the document recited that the value was believed to be £X, and that the person entering into the transaction was neither a director nor a connected person, whoever thereafter dealt with the property could take that recital as prima facie true. That would not involve him in going any further than normal conveyancing. He must then discover whether, if it exceeded that value, there was an affirmative resolution in a general meet-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0237">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 431</span>
ing. Normally, he would find that out only by demanding the production of a minute book. Sometimes one is not very certain that minute books have been written up honestly. I refer to something in the notes that we have before us—the Peachey case.<br><br>
However, when a property is purchased there is normally a search against the company. It might be made an obligation to file a resolution of the general meeting affirming such a transaction, which would come out in the search. That would not require a purchaser to do any more than he normally does when examining the title.<br><br>
Those are simply suggestions, perhaps a little bit off the cuff, but I believe that they would solve many of the problems that I raised earlier.<br><br>
I repeat my great gratitude to my hon. Friend for his proposals for consultation and further amendments. Having regard to the general tenor of the debate, I would not wish you, Sir Stephen, to call the amendment, but were you to do so I should seek leave to withdraw it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I just say, before the Minister replies, that I ought to have thanked him for letting us have these short notes on clauses. They are headnotes rather than anything else, but we are grateful to him for acting upon what was said last time, and they are helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for those kind remarks, and my right hon. Friend for his helpful suggestions—and, if I may say so, for his' joke.</span></p>

<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
This is the first of the new clauses which lay down stricter rules on the provision of loans and other forms of credit by companies to their directors and connected persons. Although we are discussing each of the new clauses separately, this clause is something of a curtain-raiser on what is to follow, and I therefore think that it would be useful if I were to give a little background to our thinking on directors' conflicts of interest. I hope that such background, which is also relevant to the Committee's understanding of the content of the succeeding clauses, will help in its consideration.<br><br>
Many of the provisions of the new
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0238">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 433</span>
clauses were foreshadowed in the Bill, and the succeeding amendments to it, which the previous Administration introduced last year. Our aim in tabling these clauses is to deal with the unsatisfactory situation in the statutes which enables unscrupulous directors to divert company assets for their personal benefit.<br><br>
Loans by a company to its director or a director of its holding company, and guarantees and securities entered into by the company on loans by third parties to such directors, are prohibited by section 190 of the 1948 Act, subject to various exemptions, the most important of which is that enabling moneylending companies—whose ordinary business includes the lending of money and the giving of guarantees for loans—to make such loans or to give such guarantees in the ordinary course of business.<br><br>
As members of the Committee will know, these provisions have been ineffective in preventing serious abuses, particularly by directors of "secondary" banks. Such abuses have, unhappily, been reported in recent years. Inspectors' reports have frequently recommended a tightening-up of the law relating to loans to directors. The need to cover certain other types of transaction, which we are now calling quasi-loans and credit transactions, was, of course, highlighted in the inspectors' report on the Peachey Property Corporation.<br><br>
In tightening up the provisions of the 1948 Act, we are leaving behind a simpler and more easily comprehensible formulation of the law. We do this with some regret, but I fear that if we are to give shareholders and the wider public reassurance that the small minority of directors who manipulate company assets to their own advantage will be prevented from so doing, then complicated provisions in the statute book are required.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) will consider very carefully the words I just used, because they describe the style of mind in which we approached this obligation.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
What we have done, therefore, is to scrutinise very carefully the proposals
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 434</span>
in the last Bill, with the advantage of the comments made in the then Committee and the considerable volume of advice that was received from outside bodies. This work has identified a number of loopholes which I think we have now closed, and some inconsistencies which have been ironed out.<br><br>
New clause 23 therefore attempts to state the scope of the various provisions relating to the granting of loans or credit by companies to their directors, their holding company directors, and persons connected with them. The various exemptions and qualifications to the prohibitions in new clause 23 are set out in new clause 24, and the extent to which a transaction or arrangement is permitted by virtue of such exclusions is prescribed in new clause 25.</span></p>
<p>[MR. SPENCER LE MARCHANT <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p>Further, the 1948 Act can also now be seen to be defective in that it does not provide for sanctions in cases of contravention and, although it requires some degree of disclosure, section 197 exempts loans made in the ordinary course of business by moneylending companies. In these areas, too, we are proposing to tighten up the existing provisions. I refer to new clauses 26 to 32, which we shall come to in due course.</p>
<p>As a final piece of background, let me say that we propose a three-tier system for public companies, in which the serious abuses arise. In brief, we first distinguish public companies which do not lend money in the ordinary course of their business. Such companies will be prohibited from making loans and so forth to their directors and connected persons and will be subject to criminal penalties for any breach. Then we specify "moneylending" public companies which will be limited, in making loans to directors, to normal commercial terms and to an overall limit of £50,000 to each director taken together with his connected persons. All loans and so forth made by both these categories of company will be disclosed in the accounts.</p>
<p>Lastly, recognised banks will be permitted to lend to directors and connected persons only on normal commercial terms, but without limit, except for house purchase schemes where, like the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0239">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 435</span>
moneylending companies, they will be limited to £50,000. Recognised banks will be required to make details of all such loans and so forth available for inspection by shareholders during a period prior to the annual general meeting.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Le Marchant. I hope that my hon. Friend, having gone into subsequent clauses, will not preclude us from debating them when we reach those clauses.

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are being taken separately.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate my right hon. Friend's point, but I think that he will agree as we go along that it is necessary for me to make brief references to clauses which are to follow to assist the Committee in understanding the proposals contained in new clause 23.</span></p>
<p>[SIR STEPHEN MCADDEN <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p>I turn now to the details of new clause 23. Subsection (1)(a) repeats the existing prohibition in section 190 of the 1948 Act by providing that any company, public or private, shall not make a loan, or secure or guarantee loans made by other persons, to its directors or those of its holding company. A holding company includes any intermediary parent in a group of companies.</p>
<p>Subsection (1)(b) brings in relevant companies. These are defined in new clause 36 as public companies, or companies forming part of a group which contains a public company. The main abuse of the existing provisions has occurred in public companies, and it is in these that, generally, shareholders' funds are more at risk from the activities of unscrupulous directors. Thus, additionally, we prohibit such relevant companies from making quasi-loans—a term which I shall come to in a moment—to its directors, or the directors of its holding company, and from making loans or quasi-loans, or securing or guaranteeing such loans or quasi-loans made by other persons, to persons connected with such directors.</p>
<p>I re-emphasise that we see no need to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 436</span>
extend those extra rules to private companies. The relationship between a director, his family, and the private company of which he is a director, is much more intimate and flexible than that between the typically larger public company and its directors who do not combine managerial functions with a significant degree of ownership. Other problems arise in connection with private companies and their shareholders, particularly the oppression of minority shareholders and we seek elsewhere in the Bill—for example, clause 47—to deal with those problems. The public are much less involved in private companies and the scope for defrauding investors is less in what are, typically, family concerns.</p>
<p>I should like to say a word about quasi-loans. As can be seen from the definition provided in a later clause, they consist of the transaction between a company and a director or connected person whereby the company pays, or promises to pay, a third party on behalf of that person. Therefore, such a transaction is, in substance, a loan, as I am sure hon. Members will appreciate if I cite as an example a credit card which, where it is held by a company, enables a person who is allowed to operate the card to buy goods on terms that the liability to pay falls to his company as cardholder. Where the company concerned is the issuer of the card itself—that is, a bank—the third party to be paid is the supplier of the goods, and the person to whom the bank has made the card available reimburses the bank direct.</p>
<p>That system of providing credit is, of course, used in a wide variety of circumstances. Other types of transaction covered by the definition of quasi-loan include any arrangements such as those that operated at Peachey Property Corporation where companies in the group laid out money on their own account for goods and services for the chairman's personal use, on the basis that reimbursement would be made by him later.</p>
<p>Quasi-loans were included in the generality of credit transactions in the previous Administration's Bill, whereas we have separated them because they represent the chief abuse identified in the Peachey report. The granting of other forms of credit—for example, by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0240">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 437</span>
hire purchase or leasing agreements—by companies does not provide the same risk of misuse as quasi-loans. A public company that provides goods on deferred terms in the ordinary course of its business to its directors will be within the law, and hon. Members will find that subsection (2), in conjunction with new clause 24(2), provides for that.</p>
<p>The Committee will have noted that I have referred to connected persons. Given the great potential for abuse in public companies, we think it prudent to extend the limitations imposed on directors to those persons, individual and corporate, who are very close to them. As new clause 35 indicates, spouses and children to the age of 18 are deemed to be connected, as are bodies corporate in which the directors and connected persons, taken together, have a 20 per cent. or more interest. Trustees of trusts whose beneficiaries include such connected persons are also covered.</p>
<p>The definition is a little more complex than that and detailed discussion of it should obviously be left until we have reached that clause, but it will be useful to keep this general description in mind in considering this and the intervening clauses.</p>
<p>Subsections (3) and (4) introduce provisions designed to support the basic prohibitions set out in the first two subsections by blocking the more obvious ways by which unscrupulous directors might seek to evade them. Subsection (3) prohibits any arrangement for the assignment of rights to a company or the assumption by it of liabilities under a transaction that, if the company had directly entered into it, would have been prohibited under the first two subsections. An example of such an assignment is where a third party has made a loan to a director and subsequently, the director's company purchases the third party's rights to the repayment of the principal advanced and the payment of interest on that principal. The company has therefore laid out resources to acquire an asset and becomes a creditor of the director just as if it had advanced the loan in the first place.</p>
<p>An example of an assumption of liabilities, would be the case of a third party that guarantees the loan made by a fourth party to a director. If the company enters into an arrangement with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 438</span>
the third and fourth parties, whereby the third party is released from his guarantee and the company assumes the liability, again we have a situation where the company's resources are tied up by a continguent liability when assumed on behalf of a director. I am sure that hon. Members will be aware of the possibilities for collusive arrangements that would be open to the unscrupulous if we failed to prohibit such transactions.</p>
<p>The closing words of subsection (3), are to ensure that for the purpose of calculating the financial limits provided for in new clause 24 and elsewhere the transaction to which the company becomes a party by virtue of an assignment or assumption of liabilities is treated as if it was first entered into when the company becomes a party.</p>
<p>Subsection (4) provides for the prohibition of any arrangements that involve first, the carrying out by a third party of any of the transactions described in the previous subsections by a third party that, had they been carried out by the company, would have been prohibited and, secondly, that such action by a third party is done in return for advantages provided, either by the company where directors or connected persons are the beneficiaries of the transactions concerned, or by any other company in its group.</p>
<p>Subsection (4) is intended to block a further, and perhaps more sophisticated, means of evading the basic prohibitions. It prevents the use of a company's resources to procure another person to provide the various forms of prohibited credit without the company itself either entering into, or subsequently becoming a party to, the transaction.</p>
<p>The subsection is drafted to cover the wide variety of forms that such arrangements can take. For example it would cover what we may call back-to-back deals, where a company agrees to make loans to directors of another company in return for loans made to its own directors, or a case where a director persuades a bank to make loans on favourable terms in return for his company placing some lucrative business with the bank. In all such cases, the mischief is that the company's resources are tied up indirectly in providing credit for directors.</p>
<p>I should emphasise that the subsection will bite only where there is an arrange-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0241">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 439</span>
ment whereby the benefit conferred by the company is a quid pro quo for the facilities obtained by its directors. The fact that a bank may have both a director's personal business and that of his company will not of itself put any facilities given to the director within the subsection, if at the same time the bank continues to receive business from the company.</p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p>I emphasise that there has to be an arrangement under which the granting of facilities takes place only because the company has provided, or is to provide, specific business to the bank. I doubt whether such a specific link will exist in the usual banking relationships of the type to which I have referred and the burden of proof is on those alleging the existence of such arrangements.</p>
<p>I think that it would now be appropriate for me to refer to how these various deals are described in our proposals. We refer to, and distinguish between, a transaction that connotes the effecting of business between two parties, such as the transfer of money by way of loan or the granting of a mortgage over property, and an arrangement, which is the device which brings about such a transaction. An arrangement, therefore, may cover a number of agreements and involve a number of parties, as can be seen from the nature of the evasive devices that we have dealt with in subsections (3) and (4) of the clause. In order to cover the wide variety of situations we wish to deal with, we have therefore drafted on wide terms.</p>
<p>A word about company structure will, I hope, complete the background to the clause and the others which are to follow. We have tried to ensure throughout the new clauses that the conflict of interest between a director and his company is regulated not only in the case of the particular company of which a person is a director, but in the group situation in which a holding company owns a number of subsidiaries.</p>
<p>First, directors of subsidiary companies shal be subject to the same rules as directors of any other company. This is in contrast to their exclusion from new clauses 21 and 22, because the aim there is not so much to ban the long-service agreements and substantial property transactions as to ensure that directors are obliged to seek the affirmation of a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 440</span>
general meeting, and such control is clearly irrelevant to wholly owned subsidiaries. Such matters can only be left, in the case of those arrangements, to the control of the directors of the holding company.</p>
<p>In the case of loans and credit, where there is far more scope for abuse, and in respect of which we are providing criminal penalties for the contravention of the provisions, directors of subsidiaries shall be bound directly. Further, loans by subsidiaries to directors of the holding company, and connected persons will also be bound on the grounds that the assets of the whole group are under the direction of the holding company directors. We regard the disposal of the company's funds in this manner as a practice that should be regulated in the interests of suppliers and employees, and as well as of shareholders, not merely as an internal group matter in respect of which we seek only that shareholders should be informed and consulted.</p>
<p>Ensuring that these two principles, namely, to speak in terms of the arrangements and transactions, and to catch the flow of group assets to holding company directors, are carried through, the new clauses do complicate the drafting, but I hope that hon. Members will agree that that is necessary if we are, at last, after the long period of public consideration of these matters, to create watertight provisions.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for spelling out the philosophy and purpose underlying new clause 23 and I wholly support his objectives, notably because—at the risk of upsetting the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page)—they were largely our own thoughts. I accept that the Government have utilised the interval between the last Bill and this one to strengthen, in some respects, the Bill's provisions. We support the thesis that he has advanced today that section 190 needs to be strengthened because innumerable abuses have been committed which needed to be investigated and were investigated by the Government following inspectors' reports.<br><br>
I am not sure that the Under-Secretary is not being unduly optimistic in saying that he believes that the loopholes have now been closed. That is putting a low premium on the ability of accountants

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 441</span>
and lawyers—not to say unscrupulous business men—to devise ways and means of getting around the law. Nevertheless, the new clauses generally represent a considerable advance and the Government are to be applauded for that. That is not to say that we shall not have some criticisms to make on some of the clauses that we have yet to debate.<br><br>
It would be useful if the Minister were to spell out the way in which various types of public company will be affected by the provisions, but, generally, we welcome the advance made on this front. We have no reason to prolong the debate, but we shall return to a number of important points on new clause 24. I will only say—I am sure that the Minister will endorse it—that I am sure that the new clauses do not necessarily represent his final thinking on these important matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I notice that new clause 23(1)(<i>a</i>) applies to all companies, public or private. That is the paragraph which forbids a loan to a director of the company or of its holding company, or any guarantee or … security in connection with such a loan. Paragraph (<i>b</i>), however, refers only to "relevant" companies and forbids certain transactions with regard to relevant companies. A relevant company, according to a later new clause, is really a public company, to put it shortly.<br><br>
If private companies can be relieved of the prohibitions of paragraph (<i>b</i>), I cannot see the principle behind imposing paragraph (<i>a</i>) on private companies. Again, I wish that the Bill as it stands and the new clauses now being introduced did not impose such burdens on small private companies.<br><br>
In subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) we have the inelegant phrase "quasi-loan". I suppose that will come to be known as a "qualo", by analogy with "quango". But do we really need to import these extraordinary phrases? Either it is a loan or it is not a loan. It is a security for a loan or it is not a security for a loan. As I understand it, we are concerned with the person or company by whom the loan is made rather than with the description of the loan itself.<br><br>
That leads me on to the peculiar phraseology of subsection (3). The helpful notes that the Minister for Trade has
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 442</span>
kindly supplied tell us that subsection (3) blocks the loophole to subsections (1) and (2) provided by directors assigning their liabilities to their company. To use a common phrase—with no personal reference to the Chair, Sir Stephen" you could have kidded me". I see nothing in the clause which in the least states that. However, I suppose that it is helpful to have an explanation of the intention of subsection (3).<br><br>
What I think dangerous is this straining at what really occurs. The subsection begins by saying that
<br><blockquote><p>"A company shall not arrange for the assignment"</p></blockquote>
of certain things. It then goes on to provide that the date on which it makes such an arrangement shall be treated as the date of the assignment
<br><blockquote><p>"for the purposes of this Part of this Act".</p></blockquote>
I should not have been so worried if it had said "for the purposes of this section". I am not even sure in which part the new clauses will come. Those words go very wide, with a strangely forced fiction that the assignment or assumption of rights and obligations happens when they are arranged.<br><br>
I think that I can see the point of this, though I may be wrong. Let us take the example of the credit card. I presume that the quasi-ban which arises from a credit card transaction dates from the time that the company provides the credit card. The company arranges for the quasi-loan arising out of the credit card. We must therefore treat the company as having committed an offence, or rather as being subject to civil liability under the clause, if it is wrong in providing the credit card, because the date of the arrangement must be treated for the purpose of the clause as the date of the offence. But if we say that
<br><blockquote><p>"for the purposes of this Part of this Act"</p></blockquote>
it is the date of an assignment or assumption of rights, we shall be in some difficulty.<br><br>
Subsection (4) then begins with a phrase quite distinct from that used in subsection (3). It provides that
<br><blockquote><p>"A company shall not take part in any arrangement …".</p></blockquote>
When does a company "take part" in an arrangement? And is that arrangement, whatever it eventually results in, again to be treated as 'the date of the transaction merely because it is the date when the transaction was arranged or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0243">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 443</span>
when the company took part in the transaction?<br><br>
My hon. Friend explained very fully the intention of subsection (4), namely, that is was to catch the back-to-back deal, one subsidiary to another, or whatever it may be. I understand that. But the expressions used in subsections (3) and (4) might have been clearer, and I hope that further consideration will be given to them. I have by no means sought to express all the possible objections as it would be tedious to go into a large number of examples. But certainly it will be difficult to interpret, first, the wording of the provision in subsection (3) that a transaction shall be treated as having been entered into on the date on which it was arranged, and the phrase in subsection (4) that
<br><blockquote><p>"A company shall not take part in any arrangement …".</p></blockquote>
I hope that both subsections will be looked at again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) for his remarks, and I have noted his observations on clause 24.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) raised a number of points. The first was an important point about private companies in relation to subsection (1)(<i>a</i>). I would emphasise that the restrictions here do not impose a new burden on private companies but restate the existing restriction under section 190 of the Companies Act 1948 which already applies to private companies. To change the situation and allow directors of private companies to borrow from their companies would prejudice creditors.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend went on to pose a number of questions, all of which need consideration. It would not be possible for me to reply to them all, but perhaps
I could deal with one which relates to the last two lines of new clause 23(3). We want the degree of risk to a company, on the assignment of a loan or credit transaction, to be determined at the time—that is, the time of the assignment, not the time when the original loan was made. I hope my right hon. Friend will feel that that purpose is both sensible and justified. I do not want him to think that I seek, in brief style, to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 444</span>
reply this morning, and I assure him that careful consideration will be given to all the detailed points he made as we proceed with consideration of the Bill.</span></p>

EXCEPTIONS FROM S. (PROHIBITION OF LOANS ETC. TO DIRECTORS AND CONNECTED PERSONS)</div> <!-- title -->
<p>"(1) Where a director of a relevant company or of its holding company is associated with a subsidiary of either of those companies, sub-paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of subsections (1)(b) of section (Prohibition of loans etc. to directors and connected persons) above shall not by reason only of that fact prohibit the relevant company from—
<ol>
<li>making a loan or quasi-loan to that subsidiary; or</li>
<li>entering into a guarantee or providing any security in connection with a loan or quasi-loan made by any person to that subsidiary.</li></ol></p>
<p>(2) Subsection (2) of that section shall not prohibit a company's entering into—
<ol>
<li>any transaction for any person if the aggregate of the relevant amounts does not exceed £5,000; or</li>
<li>any transaction for any person if—</li>
<ol>
<li>the company enters into the transaction in the ordinary course of its business; and</li>
<li>the value of the transaction is not

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 445</span>
greater, and the terms on which it is entered into, are no more favourable to the person for whom the transaction is entered into than it is reasonable to expect the company to have offered for a person of the same financial standing as that person (any connection between the company and that person being disregarded).</li></ol></ol></p>
<p>(3) Subject to the following provisions of this section, each of the following is excepted from the prohibitions in section (Prohibition of loans etc. to directors and connected persons) above, that is to say—
<ol>
<li>a loan or quasi-loan by a company to its holding company or a company's entering into a guarantee or providing any security in connection with a loan or quasi-loan made by any person to its holding company;</li>
<li>a company's entering into a credit transaction as creditor for its holding company or entering into a guarantee or providing any security in connection with any credit transaction made by any other person for its holding company;</li>
<li>a company's doing anything to provide any of its directors with funds to meet expenditure incurred or to be incurred by him for the purposes of the company or for the purpose of enabling him properly to perform his duties as an officer of the company or a company's doing anything to enable any of its directors to avoid incurring such expenditure;</li>
<li>a loan or quasi-loan made by a moneylending company to any person or a money-lending company's entering into a guarantee in connection with any other loan or quasi-loan.</li></ol></p>
<p>(4) The exception specified in subsection (3)(c) above operates only if one of the following conditions is satisfied, that is to say—
<ol>
<li>the thing in question is done with the prior approval of the company given at a general meeting at which the purpose of the expenditure incurred or to be incurred or which would otherwise be incurred by the director and the amount of the funds to be provided by the company and the extent of the company's liability under any transaction which is, or is connected with, that thing are disclosed;</li>
<li>that thing is done on condition that, if the approval of the company is not so given at or before the next following annual general meeting, the loan shall be repaid or any other liability arising under such transaction discharged within six months from the conclusion of that meeting;</li></ol>
but that exception does not authorise a relevant company to enter into any transaction if the aggregate of the relevant amounts exceed £10,000.</p>
<p>(5) The exception specified in subsection (3)(<i>d</i>) above operates only if both the following conditions are satisfied, that is to say
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 446</span>
<ol>
<li>the loan or quasi-loan in question is made by the company or it enters into the guarantee in the ordinary course of the company's business; and</li>
<li>the amount of the loan or quasi-loan or the amount guaranteed is not greater, and the terms of the loan, quasi-loan or guarantee are not more favourable, in the case of the person to whom the loan or quasi-loan is made or in respect of whom the guarantee is entered into than that or those which it is reasonable to expect that company to have offered to or in respect of a person of the same financial standing as that person (any connection between the company and that person being disregarded);</li></ol>
but that exception does not authorise a relevant company which is not recognised as a bank for the purposes of the Banking Act 1979 to enter into any transaction if the aggregate of the relevant amounts exceeds £50,000.
<br><blockquote><p>For the purposes of this subsection a company which a director does not control is not connected with him.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>(6) The condition specified in subsection (5)(<i>b</i>) above shall not of itself prevent a company from making a loan to one of its directors or a director of its holding company—
<ol>
<li>for the purpose of facilitating the purchase, for use as that director's only or main residence, of the whole or part of any dwelling-house together with any land to be occupied and enjoyed therewith;</li>
<li>for the purpose of improving a dwelling-house or part of a dwelling-house so used or any land occupied and enjoyed therewith;</li>
<li>in substitution for any loan made by any person and falling within paragraph (<i>a</i>) or (<i>b</i>) above,</li></ol>
if loans of that description are ordinarily made by the company to its employees and on terms no less favourable than those on which the transaction in question is made, and the aggregate of the relevant amounts does not exceed £50,000.".—[<i>Mr. Eyre.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
This clause contains all the exceptions from the prohibitions listed in new clause 23. To understand the nature of these clauses, in which we are providing for the situation applying to loans to directors, it is necessary to consider the effect of the clauses altogether.<br><br>
The length and complexity of new clause 24 is inevitable as the various transactions and arrangements which are prohibited merit different degrees of exemption, some of which apply to all companies whilst others apply to only one of the three tiers of public company
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0245">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 447</span>
which we have distinguished, and to which I referred in introducing the previous new clause.<br><br>
I turn first to subsection (1), the background to which derives from the fact that a company is associated with a director, by virtue of new clause 35, if in broad terms the director has an interest in at least one-fifth of the share capital, or controls the exercise of at least one-fifth of the voting power in general meeting. Such an association with a subsidiary makes the subsidiary a connected person of, or with, that director for the purpose of this part of the Bill.<br><br>
At this point the Committee will need to recall that relevant companies are prohibited by virtue of new clause 23(1)(<i>b</i>)(i) and (ii) from making loans or quasi-loans, or entering into guarantees or providing security in respect of loans or quasi-loans to connected persons of their directors. But to prohibit the making of loans and so on by a holding company to a subsidiary simply by virtue of the subsidiary's association with a holding company director would be obstructive of the normal and proper course of intra-group business. Subsection (1) therefore provides an exemption for such transactions and arrangements.<br><br>
I should point out here that subsections (3) and (4) of new clause 23 apply only to the extent that they bite on transactions that would have been caught by subsections (1) and (2) of that clause. Where an exemption in the clause affects any type of transaction—loan, quasi-loan, credit transaction and guarantees and securities thereto—assignment and back-to-back deals involving that type are also exempted.<br><br>
Subsection (2) relates to credit transactions by relevant companies, providing a lower limit prohibition and a normal course of business exception for credit transactions above that limit.<br><br>
Paragraph (<i>a</i>) provides a lower limit of £5,000, this figure being an aggregate of the value of all outstanding credit transactions under any existing arrangements made for the director in question and his connected persons. We are out to catch major abuses, not to worry about small credit transactions which may not be strictly commercial but which would not be of significant value—such as, for example, minor car
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 448</span>
repairs in the company's workshops, and the <i>de minimis</i> provision reflects this.<br><br>
Given that we have a strict regime for the credit extended by virtue of quasi-loans, we are able to provide in paragraph (<i>b</i>) an exemption for all credit transactions which are made on arm's length terms. There is no reason to prevent companies whose ordinary course of business includes, for example, the supply of goods via hire purchase or leasing arrangements, from doing business with their directors. This is to be contrasted with the ban on loans to directors, except for expenses, on the part of ordinary companies, as such companies are not in the business of lending money.<br><br>
Further, it would be an unnecessary restraint on a company's normal trading if it was unable to supply goods to other companies on trade credit simply because those companies happened to be the connected persons of its directors. The safeguard lies in the requirement that the business must be conducted on normal arm's length commercial terms, and under the disclosure requirements which we shall discuss in due course.<br><br>
Subsection (3)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) exempts from the general prohibition all transactions by companies in favour of their holding companies. This exemption is necessary because a holding company may be a director of its subsidiary and, what may be more likely in practice, a director may be such a substantial shareholder of the parent that it, the parent, is a connected person of that director. In such cases, loans and credit transactions and so on made by the subsidiary for its holding company would be prohibited by the provisions of new clause 23.<br><br>
Naturally we do not wish to interfere with legitimate lending between companies within a group so a specific exemption has been provided for this purpose. This exemption, together with that of subsection (1), provides a comprehensive exemption for intra-group transactions.<br><br>
The exception for expenses incurred for the purposes of the company is stated in subsection 3(<i>c</i>). The conditions under which this exception can be taken advantage of are detailed in subsection (4). The expenses exception covers not only advance of funds to meet expenditure incurred by a director for the purpose of the company, or to enable him to per-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0246">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 449</span>
form his duties, but also anything other than funds—for example, goods, services or credit—which will enable him to avoid incurring such expenditure.<br><br>
Subsection (4) provides that only £10,000 of funds can be made available to each director of a relevant company under the exception, and for all companies one of two conditions must be fulfilled. Those are either that the transaction is entered into with the prior authority of the company in general meeting, or that the transaction must contain a provision that if it is not approved by the company before the next annual general meeting any liabilities arising under it must be discharged within six months of that annual general meeting. Those conditions represent a repetition of those that applied in respect of the equivalent exemption in section 190 of the 1948 Act—the obvious and sensible safeguards against abuses of the exemption.<br><br>
Subsection 3(<i>d</i>) states the familiar moneylending exemption. The parallel exemption in section 190 of the 1948 Act has, of course, been subject to much abuse, particularly in the case of secondary banks. But I believe the conditions that we have laid down covering the exemption, which are set out in subsection (5), and in particular the stringent disclosure requirements described in later new clauses relating to all transactions made under the exemption, are sufficiently tight to prevent similar abuse in the future.<br><br>
The exemption is limited to loans and quasi-loans and to guarantees given in connection with such transactions made by a moneylending company in the ordinary course of its business. Subsection 5(<i>b</i>) states that such loans must be on normal commercial terms, the criterion being that the terms must be no more favourable than those which it is reasonable to expect the company to have offered to any other customer of the same financial standing. For ordinary moneylending companies the upper limit on loans and quasi-loans made under the exception is £50,000, which is an aggregate limit for each director taken together with his connected persons.<br><br>
I turn to the exemption in subsection (5) for recognised banks on which the previous Committee had considerable debate. The point was made then that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 450</span>
the £50,000 limit on the generality of moneylending companies was unnecessarily restrictive for certain highly reputable moneylending companies. We have given careful consideration to renewed representations which have been made to us. There are a number of factors to bear in mind in considering those moneylending companies which are recognised banks.<br><br>
The typical case that I have in mind is a clearing bank. First, the prohibition of loans above the £50,000 limit by banks to those companies associated with any of the bank's directors would be clearly disruptive to perfectly proper commercial business between those companies and the bank.<br><br>
Second, that prohibition is likely to cut off an important source of potential directors from the bank—that is, those people closely associated with large companies with which the bank does business and also those, such as large-scale farmers, who may in the ordinary course of their business require sizeable loans from their bank from time to time.<br><br>
Third, it appears that none of the clearing banks has been implicated in the abuses that came to light during the secondary bank crisis. Decisions on loans tend to be dispersed to branch or regional level rather than being a matter for the boards of such banks.<br><br>
One proposal for accommodating those arguments is that the supervision of loans made by banks to their directors be taken out of the jurisdiction of the Companies Acts and be transferred to the Bank of England, as part of its process of prudential supervision. The Bank of England is not, however, in the business of supervising the propriety of individual loans, as its supervision relates to the trading safety of the institutions concerned, with the aim of protecting depositors' interests. Only if a bank's loans to its directors were in aggregate of such size as to endanger its safety would the Bank of England's interest be triggered.<br><br>
Our proposal, therefore, reflects the need to protect the shareholders' interests and, in short, provides that recognised banks may lend to directors without limit, house mortgage loans apart, so long as the loans are on commercial terms and disclosed to shareholders. Recognised banks are those companies granted recognition as such
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0247">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 451</span>
by the Bank of England on the grounds that, according to the Banking Act 1979, they have established a high reputation and standing in the financial community.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
The £50,000 upper limit applicable to other moneylending companies will not, therefore, apply to them. Since this category goes wider than what is ordinarily meant by clearing banks, we have taken steps to prevent abuse of the exemption by defining carefully in subsection (5) the condition of normal commercial terms and by providing in a later clause for details of transactions between recognised banks and their directors and connected persons to be available for inspection by shareholders at the time of the annual general meeting.<br><br>
I should add that we have found it impossible to devise a separate definition of clearing banks which would only cover, for instance, the High Street banks. Such a definition would not exclude a number of other financial institutions whose financial standing is not so exalted.<br><br>
The problems in relation to loans by banks to companies associated with any of the banks' directors is alleviated by the tailpiece of subsection (5), which exempts companies with which a director is associated but which he does not control—broadly, those companies in which the director has a 20 per cent. to 50 per cent. interest—from the definition of a connected person for this particular provision.<br><br>
Such companies will be connected only if the director controls more than half the voting power or owns more than half the share capital. This is necessary as it would be very difficult for the bank to keep constant track for the purpose of complying with these provisions of all transactions between the bank and the wider range of companies comprised in the broader category of associated companies, particularly as most of these transactions are likely to have been arranged at branch level throughout the clearing bank system.<br><br>
Finally, I should mention that there is an exemption in subsection (6) from the normal commercial terms condition for loans by the moneylending companies for house purchase and house improve-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 452</span>
ment. This exemption may operate, though, only if such loans are part of a general housing scheme operated by the company for its employees generally, and the terms of such loans must be no more favourable than those enjoyed by the employees. The £50,000 limit applies strictly here to recognised banks as well as to ordinary moneylending companies as there is no reason for treating directors of recognised banks any more lightly than the directors of ordinary moneylending companies in this respect.<br><br>
The housing exemption does not allow companies other than moneylending companies to make house loans to directors. Of course, such loans by non-moneylending companies are already prohibited by section 190 of the 1948 Act. Non-moneylending companies are not in business to provide loans for any purpose and to permit such loans would invite abuse.<br><br>
I apologise for having spoken at length, but I hope that I have helped the Committee to understand the implications of the new clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This new clause is a difficult one to comprehend, and life would be much simpler if we took the advice of the Institute of Chartered Accountants and simply prohibited all loans which might be made by companies to directors. I understand that the Institute feels that no undue harm would be caused if the law were to say just that. It concludes that it should not be too difficult for a director of a bank, presumably creditworthy—otherwise, why is he a director?—to apply for a loan, even to a competitor bank. Certainly, it could not reject him on the ground that he was not creditworthy: there might be other grounds for so doing, but certainly not those. It would be difficult to produce a law of that character, because life is not as simple as that, although the more I examine the clauses the more I think that simplicity has its virtues.<br><br>
We came to the conclusion, in introducing our Bill, that that was not the route that should be followed, although nothing that I or my colleagues said previously in Committee, or anything that the Government are now putting down, has deflected the Institute from that general proposition. It is right that we should pay close attention to what it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0248">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 453</span>
says because it has undoubtedly done much valuable work on the previous Bill, as I am sure it is doing on this one. I know that the Institute will make representations soon to hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.<br><br>
It is also right that the Government should join with the previous Government in expressing great concern about the inadequacies of section 190 of the 1948 Act. In numerous inspectors' reports abuses were highlighted and it is absolutely wrong to allow a bank or company to shelter under proviso (<i>d</i>) of section 190, which refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"a company whose ordinary business includes the lending of money or the giving of guarantees in connection with loans made by other persons."</p></blockquote>
It is that part of section 190 that has lent itself to such abuse over the years. Unquestionably, the concern that has been expressed by inspectors that companies and banks that were mismanaged should not retain these powers, which are capable of such easy abuse, has motivated the previous Government and the present Government to embark upon this admittedly complicated set of reforms.<br><br>
A report of a recent case—the Dowgate case—was published shortly after the present Government took office. The inspectors found that loans were made to directors on terms that could not possibly be justified if ordinary commercial criteria were applied. That applied in the Peachey case. The same situation was revealed in a case that was not the subject of an inspector's report—Keyser Ullmann—where there was the most blatant abuse which benefited a number of directors.<br><br>
Not long ago, the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) referred to fraudulent minutes. In the Keyser Ullmann case there did not appear to be any minutes when it came to the benefiting of directors who received loans on unquestionably favourable and non-commercial terms. There were no minutes because the board did not know; it did not meet to discuss these matters. That was not a breach of criminal law as it stood, but now I think that it would be.<br><br>
On reflection, I have some doubts about how one establishes the criteria that are set out in new clause 24(2)(<i>b</i>).
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 454</span>
It is not easy to establish as a matter of evidence that the criteria there will themselves have been established. I am not sure how the Government can get over that; I am merely pointing out something which I believe may provide a certain difficulty. How would one be able to convince people that a director is not being given rather more favourable consideration than some ordinary member of the public? That is very difficult. As I have said, I am not sure what the answer is<br><br>
I turn to subsection (6), about which also I have some doubts. So far as I can see—if I am right, perhaps the Minister will indicate that to me with a nod—it is substantially in the same form as clause 49(7) of the previous Bill. I see no nod from the Minister; however, there is still time for one. In any event, they seem on the face of it to be very similar.<br><br>
I have some anxiety about the position, because I am not sure whether in making this proviso, we shall legitimise some of the worst practices which have been indicted by inspectors' reports. To a large extent, it negates the purpose of subsection (5) of the clause. It has to be established that the loans of the sort that we are considering
<br><blockquote><p>"are ordinarily made by the company to its employees and on terms no less favourable than those on which the transaction in question is made, and the aggregate of the relevant amounts does not exceed £50,000."</p></blockquote>
In a sense, that is contrary to what the Government set out as one of their purposes. I hear that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who so far has not intervened—even incorrectly, as did the Leader of the House—in our proceedings has been opposed to the perpetuation of perks. However, the provision does just that. I should like to know from the Minister how he reconciles what the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been saying in that respect with what this part of the clause seeks to achieve. I think that there is a certain philosophical difficulty there.<br><br>
