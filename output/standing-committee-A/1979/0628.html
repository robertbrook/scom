	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Education and Scence (Dr. Rhodes Boyson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>"That during the proceedings on the Education Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock."</p></q>
First, may I congratulate you, Miss Fookes, on your election to the chairmanship of the RSPCA? I trust that your chairmanship of this Committee will properly protect us throughout the time that we spend on the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, I should like to mention to Conservative members of the Committee who were not present for the unlamented fall of the Labour Government's Education Bill in the last Parliament that the Chairman on that occasion has now been given a peerage, so the chairmanship of this Committee is very important and a precedent for rapid promotion to another House. I am not suggesting that there is any desire in the Committee for a quick repetition this morning but it shows how important a Committee this is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have no objection to the motion at this stage. I add my felicitations, as I hope it will be a felicitous Committee, to your appointment, Miss Fookes, and hope that this Committee is an offshoot of the Royal society for the protection of cruelty to Back-Benchers and Opposition Members. I suspect that it may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if you cannot follow the example of your illustrious predecessor on the Education Bill Committees, Miss Fookes, we are in a position to offer you a dameship, if that will make a difference, in the true traditions of the Socialist Left of our party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank hon. Members for those felicitations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add my congratulations on behalf of the true Back Benchers on this Side of the Committee. We Shall not have very
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
much to say on the Sittings motion, though there may be something to be Said on the rest of the Bill. Everybody in the Committee is pleased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly pleased because I sat under your august chairmanship on a Select Committee some years ago when we were trying to review the law on charities. It is now five years since we reported and the Government still have not responded to our Splendid recommendations. I hope we have rather better luck this time in making progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank members of the Committee who have offered me these flattering compliments, but ask them to remember that I am a harsh Chairman and that flattery will not get hon. Members anywhere when it comes to the rules of order. I promise only to be kind to animals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will see what we can do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>ABOLITION OF DUTY TO GIVE EFFECT TO COMPREHENSIVE PRINCIPLE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to announce that I am not normally willing to accept starred amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 11, after "are", insert
	<br><q><p>"as far as the duties of local education authorities relating to secondary education are concerned".</p></q>
This amendment is very important, in my view, but not one on which I shall make a party political speech. The remarks I shall make in support of the amendment are important for all local education authorities, whatever form of secondary education they intend to adopt in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment proposes that the procedures which were outlined in the the 1976 Education Act should become permissive, although they cease to be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0412">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
mandatory, and not be abolished altogether. Though it will no longer be a duty for local education authorities to follow those procedures laid down in the 1976 Act, if any authority wished to follow those procedures—they have great advantage in terms of the linkage of plans to section 13 proposals—it should he able to do so. It is for that reason that the amendment seeks to insert the words
	<br><q><p>"as far as the duties of local education authorities relating to secondary education are concerned".</p></q>
I refer the Committee to the wording of clause I of the 1976 Act—a clause which this Bill proposes to repeal. It says:
	<br><q><p>"Subject to subsection (2) below, local education authorities shall, in the exercise and performance of their powers and duties relating to secondary education, have regard to the general principle that such education is to be provided only in schools where the arrangements for the admission of pupils are not based (wholly or partly) on selection by reference to ability or aptitude."</p></q>
The amendment Seeks to enSure—the Minister will tell us whether he feels that it will do so—that, whatever might happen to the duties of local education authorities under the 1976 Act, their general powers—referred to in the 1976 Act, as set out in the 1944 Education Act and subsequent ActS—should be preserved, and that they should have the power to ask to go along the 1976 road, if they wish, and use their powers in that way even if they no longer have the duty to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the fatal flaw in this short Bill is that it says what Government policy is not, but it does not say what Government policy is. It leaves an enormous vacuum where the Government have a duty to fulfil, under the law. I say that they have a duty under the law, because that is what the law says. The law—that is, section 1 of the 1944 Education Act—says quite clearly that it shall he the duty of the Secretary of State for Education and Science
	<br><q><p>"to promote the education of the people of England and Wales and the progressive development of institutions devoted to that purpose, and to secure the effective execution by local authorities, under his control and direction, of the national policy for providing a varied and comprehensive "—</p></q>
—there "comprehensive" means what they thought was comprehensive in 1944,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
not what we mean by the word today—
	<br><q><p>"educational service in every area."</p></q>
The law there lays a duty on the Secretary of State to control and direct the planning of the development of primary and secondary schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now the Government are saying that they no longer intend to fulfil that duty, as laid upon them by law in the 1944 Education Act. In my view, they propose to act completely illegally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to go into that subject at length, but first I want to dispose of one of the arguments. The Government say that they want to release education authorities from that duty in the 1976 Act, saying that their intention is to give local freedom. It is implausible to believe in the idea that this Government want local freedom, when the headlines day by day produce instances showing that they clearly do not want local freedom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could refer to the Government's policy over council house Sales, their policy on local government revaluation, the new powers it is said they are to take to prevent local authorities from raising the rates, or to penalise them for doing so. But if I did go on like that, Miss Fookes, I am sure you would pull me up as I would be outwith the scope of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is probably just as well for the Government that I am not allowed to refer to house Sales, revaluation, and the rates, because to do So would make it clear that the Government do not support the principle of local authority freedom. They are just talking about it in the Bill because they dislike comprehensive education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Historically, section 1 of the Education Act 1944 imposed upon the Minister the duty of controlling and directing the development of secondary schools, and clause 11 gave local education authorities the duty of producing development plans. The 1944 Act would have been better if that had been made a continuous duty, and not a once-for-all duty. But it was made Such a duty, and that is how the Education Act 1944 worked for the first 15 to 20 years. The Minister controlled and directed, the local authorities created development plans, and the Act worked according to the law. The Minister always had section 13 as a sort of long-Stop ministerial approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
Section 13 is relevant to the present position. Section 13 was not introduced into the 1944 Act with any idea of being concerned with comprehensive education. It was introduced at the behest of nonconformist interests which were terrified, particularly in Wales, that a new Government might alter the balance between church schools and county schools. Those interests wanted the Minister to hold overall control. It is only more recently that section 13 has been used for comprehensive education. But in those days the planning of local education authorities developed in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A development plan was drawn up. When one neared the point of applying for Section 13 approval for a change in use of a school, or for a new school—usually it was for a new school, because the population was increaSing—one went to the Department, discussed it, got fairly big nods and winks about the way one would probably get section 13 approval if one stuck to one's own development plan. one continued planning and, almost invariably, in the end, received that section 13 approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of my hon. Friends, and hon. Members on the Government side, are well versed in the ways of local education authorities, and I hope that they will feel free during the debate on this amendment, on Subsequent amendments, the new clauses and and on clause stand part, to give the Committee—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend was not present at the Committee on the last Education Bill, but I can assure him that on that occasion the Labour Government allowed their Back Benchers a free hand to develop and endeavour to improve the Bill. I hope my hon. Friend will press the Government for the same assurances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think they will need any pressing. Apart, Miss Fookes, from your own rich background in education—unfortunately we are not able to hear from you—there is the hon. Member for Liverpool, Garston (Mr. Thornton) who probably has more experience than anyone else in the Committee of the day-to-day workings of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
local education authorities. I am sure that he, together with the hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. van Straubenzee), with his vast ministerial experience of these matters, the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Shelton), the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Greenway) and others, will give us the advice which the Committee, especially its new members, will sorely need if it is to be able to sort out this knotty, difficult problem. I look forward to their speeches with eager anticipation and I shall listen with patience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I so rudely interrupted myself, I was saying that, under the 1944 Act, the powers of direction and control by the Minister, the access of local authorities to the Minister, and the indication which the DES gave to local authorities, all worked very well according to the law as laid down in section I of the 1944 Act. When 1965 arrived, circular 10/65 on comprehensive education was needed not so much because the Labour Party was mad keen on going comprehensive, as because many Conservative local authorities were just as keen. The Leicestershire scheme had gone through without any section 13 applications at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Circular 10/65 was issued because of the flaw in the 1944 Education Act regarding one-off development plans. The plans had been drawn up in 1948 and were coming to an end. One clearly cannot plan for more than a 20-year span. Circular 10/65 was to carry on the development plans for another 10 or 15 years. The circular worked fairly well, after a year or two. The same situation existed in many local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee who were members of local authorities in those days will remember going on delegations to Curzon Street—where the DES was then situated. One would outline the plans one had. Officials would say "Well, if you pushed it this way and that way a little, section 13 should not produce any problems".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once again there was unofficial, if not official, linkage between the planning process at local level and the control and direction process at ministerial level. That linkage is essential if the development of the education system is to work at all, whether one is creating grammar or secondary schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My greatest complaint about this Bill, and in particular clause 1(1), is that it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0414">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
shatters at a stroke that process of consultation and co-operation. It was first shattered at a stroke by Dame Florence Horsbrugh—I am sorry that all the actors in this drama are women.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That makes them actresses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend says, that makes them actresses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process was first shattered by the first Conservative Minister in 1951, who rapidly had to be replaced by Sir David, now Lord, Eccles, simply because she was, through her policy, causing such chaos in local education authorities. She did not last very long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next time that consensus was shattered was when, very foolishly, the right hon. Member for Sidcup (Mr. Heath) appointed the present Prime Minister as his Oppositon spokesman on education. When she became Secretary of State for Education and Science in 1970, she did much of what this Bill purports to seek to do. She just tore up circular 10/65, without putting anything in its place. That is the negativity of Toryism: "We do not believe in comprehensive education, but we do not know what we do believe in, so we are not putting any policy at all in its place".

For four years, local education authorities—particularly Conservative authorities—were thrown into absolute chaos. They could not indulge in any planning at all for the future development of their systems because they were given no guarantees, such as were given under circular 10/65, of what they might expect to happen to their section 13 applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present Prime Minister, who was then Secretary of State for Education and Science, was so keen to interfere with planning and development at local level that she actually issued a section 68 order saying that the local authority of Surrey—one of her own Conservative local authorities—was behaving unreasonably in wanting to go comprehensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was temporarily away from this place during those years. I was trying to turn an honest penny as an education journalist, which is extremely difficult. I used to go to press conferences at which, time and time again, the then Secretary of State was begged to give
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
some certainty in planning, and, time and time again, she put on her legalistic hat and said that the Education Act 1944 told her to consider every section 13 on its merits and that that was what she would do. She would not provide any clues at all to the possibility of a section 13 application being approved. Education authorities up and down the country were dogged, day in and day out, by complete uncertainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Right from 1970 the policy was to go back to grammar schools, but, once again, the Tory Party dared not say so. The unsung heroes of comprehensive education in those days were some of the Conservative local education authority chairmen, who told the then Secretary of State exactly what they thought of her policies on comprehensive education. I am thinking of people such as Patrick Crotty of Leeds and others who insisted that their Tory education authorities went comprehensive and prevented the worst effects of the Tory policies in those years from 1970 to 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Exactly the same policy is now being introduced again. The Government have come in and promptly introduced legislation in exactly the same way as the Government tore up circular 10/65 in 1970. They are saying: "No guidance. We will not tell you anything. We will say what we do not believe in—comprehensive education—but we will not say what we believe in. Just see how you go and when—right at the last minute—you are ready to develop the next stage of your system, put in your section 13 application. We may chop it, wasting millions of pounds of ratepayers' money, or we may let it go through, according to our whim and caprice. There is no guarantee that we shall allow anything, because we are going to smash carefully-built-up procedures for consultation between local education authorities and the central Government."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1976 Act was an attempt to bring back some order where chaos had resulted from the policies followed by the present Prime Minister between 1970 and 1974. Certainly we wanted to encourage comprehensive schools, but we did not feel that changes should be made at a tremendous rate. It was quite understood that it might take 10, 15 or even 20 years in some areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0415">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
The 1976 Act was an attempt to create some coherent relationship between the control and direction powers set out in clause I of the 1944 Education Act and the desire of the local education authority to plan and develop. It filled a gap in the 1944 Act in a way which I believe every local education authority welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Act produced some linkage, which is now being destroyed and which we are trying to put back in a little way, between the presentation of development plans for Secondary education and some sort of guarantee that section 13 notices would be approved when they were put in. Of course no absolute guarantee can be given on that, because the law lays it down that the Minister must consider every case on its merits, but one has to have some certainty in development and planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That certainty was smashed in 1970 by the present Prime Minister and it is now being smashed by a very reactionary Conservative Government, with the hon. Member for Brent, North (Dr. Boyson) in charge of schools. I understand that he is really in charge of further education, but for the purposes of this Committee he seems to have been demoted back to the school room out of the lecture room. I suspect that some Back Bench Conservative Members, who know something about local education authority planning, if they were not So gagged and were able to speak their mind, would assent to the tremendous advantage gained in 1976 by this linkage between the plans put in by the local education authority and the indication by the Minister that section 13 would go through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where are we now? We are right back to Florence Horsbrugh, right back to the present Prime Minister's regime, right hack to the anarchy of that regime, and hack, I would say—I am not in a position to challenge the Department of Education and Science—to a complete reneging on the duty laid on the Minister by section I of the 1944 Education Act, which talks about
	<br><q><p>"the progressive development of institutions"</p></q>
and securing
	<br><q><p>"the effective execution by local authorities under … control and direction"</p></q>
of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State is now saying in this first clause,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
"I am reneging on the law. I Shall not do what the 1944 Education Act instructs me to do—that is, to control and direct the progressive development of education policies".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt we shall have some debate before the Minister replies, but I want to ask him one or two questions. First, what will be the procedures in future, after the Bill is enacted, for authorities which want to develop their Secondary education? What Sort of indication will he be able to give those authorities which send delegations to him about the likelihood of success of their applications under section 13 of the Education Act, particularly if they want to go comprehensive? I have no doubt, if they come forward with applications to recreate grammar schools and Smash up comprehensive schools, as the London borough of Bexley has just announced it will do, that he will actively encourage them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has changed completely from the good old days when he was at the chalk face, as he and I like to call it, when he said that comprehensive schools and grammar school could not exist side by side. I take the point that he has gone to Damascus or left Damascus—I do not know which direction he is going in—but he has changed his mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But what will happen in future if a local education authority, be it Tameside or whoever, Says, "It will take I8 months to do all the building work. In about I8 months or two-and-a-half years' time we want to put this plan into operation"? Under the 1976 Act they would have got absolute guarantees about the Section I3 applications, because the two would be considered together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will be the position in future? Will local education authorities spend time, money, consultative procedures, talking to parents, teachers, everyone elSe—as Surrey did in the 1970S—simply to be told, "Sorry, that is it—you have done all this work and made all these preparations, but I, using my somewhat phoney powers in this respect under section I3, will negate all that because although we dare not Say that we want to go back to an elitist grammar school system, that is what we intend. We are not admitting it but just
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0416">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
ensuring that a de facto situation exists under which that can be progessively developed without admitting any policy at all."?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Brent, North (Dr. Boyson) will come clean about this. Will this total policy Vacuum be filled? Will any assurances about section I3 be given to local education authorities? The answers to these questions are quite crucial before we can get on with the rest of the Bill—for two reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, we have left a period of stability in the world of education and are into a period of declining populations. The 20 years after 1944 saw rapidly mounting populations; we have gone through 15 years on the plateau, as it were, on the top of the hill, and now populations are declining. Planning for the contraction of population is even more important and crucial than planning for increasing population. Schools have to be closed. The Government's rate support grant allocations make clear that schools have to be closed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the next five years in Some urban areas a large number of Secondary schools will have to be closed. Every closure will have to go through section 13 procedures. If, as I suspect will be the case—the hon. Gentleman says "Right, you can close anything but a grammar school "—one will end with a situation, as would have been the danger in London had it not gone comprehensive, of having 50 per cent., 60 per cent., 70 per cent. or 75 per cent. of the youngsters in each area going to grammar schools and only 25 per cent. going to a dreadful, Sink, hopeless comprehensive or secondary modern School simply because of the section 13 power exercised by the Minister and his refusal to say what he believed in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a way I wish the Minister would Say he believed in grammar Schools. I wish he was as honest as the hon. Member for Wokingham who was so charmingly honest on Second Reading when he said that he thought that 10 per cent. to grammar Schools and 90 per cent. to comprehensive schools would be acceptable to the good people of Wokingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman knows the good people of Wokingham better than I do, but I do not believe that that system would be acceptable to the good people
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
of Lewisham. However, be that as it may, if the Government were to come out and Say, "We believe in I0 per cent. grammar schools," we would know where we were, but instead they are saying absolutely nothing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one has this massive decline in population and if the Government are saying that enormously diminished resources are to be available to secondary education through the rate Support grant—as they are saying—then we must know how local authorities can plan. They cannot know how they can plan until they have Some assurances about Section 13.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason that we must get the answer0073 to these questions from the Minister is that it is time to start rebuilding some Sort of consensus about secondary education. It is absurd to go on in this state of no policy. I hope that the Bill will provide an opportunity to rebuild some consensus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In closing perhaps I may quote what I consider to be one of the greatest authorities that I can find for the need for planning and an end to uncertainty in developing the future of Secondary education. I believe that this exactly illustrates the point I wish to make. I quote from the speech of the hon. Member for Brent, North in Committee on I April 1976—on April Fools' Day. He will remember the speech and I do not believe that he will be too embarrassed if I quote it just once more. He was criticising the 1976 Act for producing too much uncertainty. If the 1976 Act produced some uncertainty this Bill produces total uncertainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman Said:
	<br><q><p>"I suggest that unless something like this is involved, and unless we are given the full information upon this "—</p></q>
referring to Section 13 provisions—
	<br><q><p>"one is almost playing a game."</p></q>
He used an image—I hope you will bear with me, Miss Fookes, because this is my final quotation—by which I was very touched. The hon. Member for Brent, North went on to reminisce, Saying:
	<br><q><p>"…in the Sunday school to which I went as a boy, in an area which is now represented by an hon. Gentleman opposite"—</p></q>
that was Mike Noble, it is very Sad that he has left us.—
	<br><q><p>"there was a game played at harvest time whereby a drawing of a donkey was put on a wall and people were blindfolded—after they had had their apples and oranges and the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0417">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
enjoyment of harvest—and given the donkey's tail. This is quite a pleasant game, and one that I can commend to all. The tail had a drawing pin through it and the participants had to cross the floor, arrive at the donkey blindfolded and put the tail where they thought the tail of the donkey should go.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>"I accept that most of us when not blindfolded know where the tail of the donkey should go. Unblindfolded men generally agree about which end of the donkey is the tail. It should be on one particular end, which simplifies the matter. But the blindfolding meant that one did not know which end of the donkey was which, and the excitement of the game—which would go on for hours and I must not describe it in any greater detail although I should love to at some social occasion—would lie in seeing where people put the tail of the donkey. The donkey finished up with many tails in different areas. It caused much merriment and laughter among other people chewing their apples and oranges".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 1 April 1976, 	<i>Standing Committee E,</i> c. 994.]</p></q>
I do not intend to go on at that sort of length. That touching reminiscence was a criticism of the 1976 Act, not on the grounds that it was too pro-comprehensive or pro-grammar school, but that it was breeding uncertainty—that it was like being blindfolded and walking around trying to pin a tail on a donkey. That graphic illustration came from none other than the hon. Member for Brent, North. I was touched when I heard it and I have quoted it on odd occasions to pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman's ability to describe this sort of uncertainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, in the hon. Gentleman's view, the 1976 Act was subject to that Sort of uncertainty, it would appear that the new situation, which simply abolishes sections 1, 2 and 3 of the Act, gives no hope whatsoever of getting any Sort of certainty. It will be like having 12 months, 24 months, or even three years, of blindfold donkey games for local authority chairmen, members and officers who are trying to plan a coherent policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not Suggest that the amendment is perfect but trying to make it clear that local authorities Still have the power to go through—perhapS informally—with the 1976 procedures, if they want to, and thereby to obtain some sort of certainty—some sort of end to a donkey's tail life—about the fate of their Section 13 proposals, is some help and some advance on what at the moment is a fairly rotten and hopeless Bill. Therefore, I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
hope that in this tiny way the Committee will feel that they wish to improve it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the next Speaker, may I ask hon. Members to speak fairly closely to the amendment? There were times it seemed to me that the approach of the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I enjoyed the Speech of the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price), particularly the wise quotes that he obtained for his Speech this morning. It was fitting, on a day when it is announced in the newspaper that you had been appointed as chairman of the RSPCA, Miss Fookes, that these animal allusions to the donkey's tail carried on the Spirit in which the Committee began.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to talk basically and technically to the amendment. Some other time the hon. Member for Lewisham, West and I will debate, here or elsewhere, the question of where power lies, in national authorities or with people. However reference was made to my "demotion" back to schools. I have always felt that schools are Very important. The Government would like to put it on record that a movement, if only temporarily, from higher education back to schools is not seen by us as demotion. We feel, unlike the Opposition, that schools are Vitally important. We Should not emphasise just higher education in this country without recognising the importance of the building blocks of the infants school, the junior school and the secondary School.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With me this morning on the Front Bench is my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North-West (Mr. Roberts)—a good area as I come from that part of the country, the north-west myself—who was also a headmaster for a number of years. We would resent, being responsible for Schools, any mention of demotion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon.

who cannot, teach", has been extended to the point where it has become, "those who can, do; those who cannot, teach; those who cannot teach become headmasters; and those who are not very successful as headmasters become junior spokesmen in the Department of Education of Science under a Tory Government".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always nice to see this ladder of possibilities, no doubt the aspiration of many headmasters throughout the whole country. It is nice of the hon. Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock) to refer to the appointments of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North-West and myself and we much appreciate the spirit in which it was done. But Since those two appointments were made I am told that applications for headmasterships throughout country have increased greatly because they realise the vast possibilities that exist, not just in the Schoolroom or the head's study. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bedwellty for giving me the opportunity of Saying this, which will give great pleasure to headmasters in the length and breadth of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope we Shall continue this Spirit throughout the Committee so that we can give confidence at the same time to the practitioners in education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister not agree that most headmasters have always believed that they can do rather better than most Secretaries and Ministers of State for the Department of Education? Now they are certain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a dangerous Statement made by the hon. Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett) whose contributions to the previous Committee I always enjoyed. I am delighted that he is also Sitting on this Committee and that we Shall have the benefit of his experience. I am sorry he has not Spoken on the amendment. I should have thought he would have had much to Say on the technical Side of this amendment, both on this century's Education Acts and also on those of the last century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the amendment which has been clearly expounded by the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
Member for Lewisham, West. We think that the amendment would weaken the whole intention of the repeal of Section I of the Education Act 1976. That section made clear that the comprehensive principle had to be taken into account by local authorities
	<br><q><p>"in the … performance of their powers and duties relating to secondary education".</p></q>
The amendment would mean that one of these provisions would come out, So that it would be "powers" but not "duties". That would weaken the Bill considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Member for Lewisham, West says that the amendment is not political—preSumably, that makes it technical—we disagree with him. If the amendment were accepted the full repeal of the compulsory comprehensive clause of the 1976 Act would be weakened. Since it was the Labour Government, in their wisdom, in drafting that Bill in 1976, who put in "powers" and "duties", that is one way in which we have followed them. If they thought it important to have "powers" and "duties" then, let us give them the credit for our believing that it is equally important to repeal both parts of the section.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We realiSe—it is not long since we argued the matter from the other side of the Committee—that this is a probing amendment, the purpose of which is to ensure that local education authorities have the power to have regard to the principles of non-Selective education where they so wish. That power will remain. That power is not taken away. Those authorities will have that power, subject to making proposals under section 13 of the 1944 Act, as they had before the passage of the 1976 Act. All that is happening is that the situation is being put back exactly where it was before the 1976 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Lewisham, West asked me about Section 13. It was a direct question, to which I must reply. Again, the position is exactly what it was before the 1976 Act. Proposals are made by local education authorities, and clearly the Secretary of State will have to consider, under the 1944 Act, any objections to those proposals which come from the area. The decision will be made on proposals—whether they come, as is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
most likely, from the movement from Selective to non-Selective education, or, in the odd case, from non-selective to Selective education, not only on their merits as Seen by the local education authority, but on the degree of local support in the area—both for and againSt—at the time. That has always been the case, since 1944.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the Minister agree that there is one difference in the Situation before 1976 and the situation now? Before 1976, we had a Government who made clear their policy regarding Section 1 of the 1944 Act—the national policy regarding Secondary education. In other words, the Government wanted to move towards comprehensive education. Now, however, the Government have Stated that they are ignoring section I, and they are laying down no national policy at all. Surely, the Minister will admit that there is that difference between the pre-1976 situation and the post-1979 situation, should the Bill happen to get through before the Government collapse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I Should like to put at ease the mind of the hon. Member for Lewisham, West. There is every likelihood of this Bill getting through before the Government collapse. Our debates here will, I think, show the importance of the Bill getting through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of our policy—it was interesting that the hon. Member himself referred to the matter in relation to Wokingham—we feel that people in the area are likely to know what is best for the schools in the area. We do not have the dogmatism of hon. Members opposite. Just because the hon. Member for Lewisham, West believes that there should be one System throughout the country, that does not mean that other areas agree with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come back to where the hon. Member Started, with the question: Where does power lie? We believe that power Should be given back to local education authorities to run their Schools according to what the people in the area want. That means that, if people in the area want comprehensive Schools, they will have them. What the hon. Member for Lewisham, West does not like is, not that they have comprehensive Schools in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
that area when they want them—we are quite happy about that—but that they retain or have some Selective Schools in that area when he does not want them to. That is the big divide between the two sides of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose—</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I just finish? Then I shall give way. The hon. Member for Lewisham, West always enjoys quoting my speeches—long may he desire to do so, and long may there be plenty of Speeches for him to quote—but there is one thing he said this morning which I shall certainly look up in 	<i>Hansard,</i> when it appears. Presumably, the debate in this Committee will be reported on the one o'clock news, because the whole country is watching our debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman quoted my hon. Friend's Statement on Second Reading that it was right for Wokingham to have 90 per cent. in non-selective schools and 10 per cent. in selective schools. The hon. Gentleman said, I thought justly, that he did not know the people in Wokingham as well as the hon. Member for that constituency, which he presumed had a right to choose. The hon. Gentleman said he knew the people of his own constituency, and I am sure that as a good constituency Member of Parliament the hon. Gentleman does know the people of his constituency. That is our very point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that moment there was a chink of light. There was a Short Step on the road to Damascus, and I gladly lead the hon. Gentleman on that way. There is no doubt that we shall now follow his further career and thoughts clearly. There are fresh doubts in his mind. Clearly he will not be able to stand much more of this Committee, for fear of causing alarm. The hon. Members sitting around him are being rebuked by the hon. Member for Bedwellty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea that this was possible was the first chink of light. I mentioned it to my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North-West at the time. No doubt if the hon. Gentleman continued, looked back to the Black Papers, and others, for evidence we may in our time see a transformation which will be observed in the length and breadth of the land.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has mentioned the case of a non-education authority in Manchester paying fees for children to go to selective schools against the wishes of the Manchester education authority. But does that reflect the views of the people of the area? Presumably that elected authority must have reflected the Views of the area, or it would not have been elected to do so. I believe that the matter is subject to a High Court decision and I do not want to say anything that might prejudice the case, or for anyone to feel that we are taking that decision here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was right to raise the situation in Manchester. I thought that he was going to refer to Tameside, knowing the proximity of Tameside to his constituency. I was taking his remarks as a trailer for a reference to the Tameside issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are concerned that schools in an area should be organised in accordance with what the local education authority wants, assuming that by the nature of the objections it is not totally against the wishes of the people in that area where the schools are being organised or reorganised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That is reflected in the views of the city council which is near to the ground and is aware of what the people of Leicester are thinking.

But all the Government can do is to say that the proposals must come from the local education authority. At that stage objections can be looked at, but it cannot be done the other way about. The hon. Member for Lewisham, West know that one cannot constantly be looking back-

wards and forwards and turning over every stone in the country.

If the county council in Leicestershire put up a scheme to do something, which was objected to by an overwhelming majority of the people of Leicester, that would have to be balanced and decided upon. But the original proposals must come to the Secretary of State under section 13 and at that level he has to make sure that the decision fits in with the wishes of those living in the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman not agree that in this case, where a county and a former local education authority, which has been absorbed within the larger one, are at odds about a form of comprehensive education, at the very least the 1976 procedure, which allowed development plans to be linked to section 13 approval, is immeasurably preferable in that it gives certainty to the people of Leicester—even if they do not get what they want, at least they know what will happen—than the present situation, which simply compounds uncertainty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether one accepts the hon. Gentlemen's statement depends on whether one wants a continuous movement in the comprehensive system. The hon. Gentleman welcomed the 1976 Act because that was what it did. But, as a matter of interest, it would have done very little on the point raised by the hon. Member for Leicester, South (Mr. Marshall), because that is presumably a question of sixth form colleges within a comprehensive system. The 1976 Act would not have done anything—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it would.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could not have done. How the system became comprehensive would depend considerably upon what the local authority wanted, irrespective of Leicester, unless objections were put forward. This is the way in which it would have worked in that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can I come back to the clause? We do not want to diverge too far from the clause, geographically or in any other way. I know that we shall be moving on to many other exciting debates, some with a little more blood and less technical detail in them than this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is pretty bloody.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must not be drawn too much by the hon. Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 1 of the 1976 Act makes it clear that in the exercise of their powers and duties local education authorities should have regard to the comprehensive principle. It was well laid down. We intend to repeal this section in its entirety, so that local authorities and the governors of voluntary schools will be able to give full and free consideration to the best pattern of provision for their area and to the role of individual schools within it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An unqualified repeal of this section would make the position of authorities and voluntary bodies—the governors of voluntary schools—abundantly clear. Unless that is clear, there could be legal and other problems. That is why we want the complete repeal of the section. The amendment proposed will weaken this repeal by limiting it to authorities' duties rather than powers. Just as in 1976 powers and duties went together, as power and responsibility must go together, they must similarly be treated the same in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, I recommend my hon. Friends not to accept the amendment. I trust that the hon. Member for Lewisham, West, who I think moved the amendment as a probing amendment, because it gave a good base on which to make clear the views of hon. Members opposite on the whole Bill, will withdraw it so that we can move on rapidly to the next one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not my intention to intervene on this clause but, having listened to the hon. Member for Brent, North (Dr. Boyson), I felt that I ought to make one or two points. He seems to think that the major concern with this clause arises where authorities are either intending to go comprehensive or trying to dismantle a comprehensive school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Probably the biggest problem will be faced by those who will have to use section 13 procedure to close some of their schools because of falling numbers. In that context some guidance should be given fairly quickly by the Government as to how those authorities should put forward their proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, at the moment, those
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0422">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
authorities will have to put forward their proposals blindfold. I wonder whether the Secretary of State will approve them. There should be some guidance for those authorities on the lines they should follow. We spent a long time on that matter on the last Education Bill. It is very important. More important than bringing forward a doctrinaire measure such as this, which will affect only a small proportion of schools in the country, is the issuing of clear guidance to local authorities on how to deal with falling rolls in secondary schools and how to bring about, if they need to, closures of some of their Schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point. I do not consider this a doctrinaire measure. I always find the Opposition doctrinaire when I disagree with them and I see how clear-minded we are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point of the hon. Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett). It is our intention in this Session to bring forward a Bill which will deal with falling rolls, parental choice, and probably with the government of schools. It is the intention of the Government to bring forward a Bill in this Session along the lines of, but with a different emphasis from, the Education Bill which fell in the last Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact is—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful. It occurred to me that an undertaking about a Bill which may or may not come before us and which I understand is not yet in any kind of conclusive draft, is not the kind of assurance that my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price) is seeking, and, even more important, not the kind of assurance sought by parents with children in the schools that could conceivably be affected. That is why my hon. Friend has tried to help the hon. Gentleman by putting forward at least a procedure which would give some assurance on Subjects of major concern to these parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That develops the point I was making. One of the worst problems in education is the uncertainty facing teachers, parents and pupils. We shall
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
have continuing uncertainty in this area until the new Bill is brought forward, and it may be some time before it reaches the statute book. Therefore, some guidance should be given immediately by the Department of Education and Science as to how it will View applications under section 13.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I moved from my first teaching job to the Second not because I particularly wanted to move, but because the uncertainty as to whether we were to become comprehensive had gone on and on. I was longing for the day when the school became comprehensive, but because there was a change of local authority control, which meant it had to be put off for a couple of years, I felt it was time to move. That was not particularly good either for me or the children I was teaching. This continuing uncertainty will be very bad for the pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be some guidance to show whether the Government would encourage schools with falling rolls to come forward with schemes which will maintain the comprehensive principle, or whether, if they come forward with that sort of proposal, they will be looked at with horror by the Department. We are asking Ministers for a clear statement of their views on comprehensives. Are they really in favour of comprehensive education? Are they genuinely intending to give local consultation—I note that we have a later amendment on that and I am sure they will support us—or will they not issue any view on comprehensive education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought the Minister was going to respond to that. Perhaps if I offer him a further question, he may take them collectively, in the true manner of answering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On several occasions—on Second Reading and in other statements—we have been informed by both the hon. Gentleman and his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that the sole purpose of the Bill is the libertarian one of the removal of compulsion. It occurs to me that simply by taking out of section 1(1) of the 1976 Act the reference to duties, one could remove the compulsion but leave the much more permissive authority to exercise powers. That would satisfy the hon. Gentleman's intention of removing compulsion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's amendment is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0423">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
intended not simply to prove but also to make sense and make a positive addition to the Bill. The only reasons why the hon. Gentleman cannot accept it are strictly doctrinaire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not object to people being doctrinaire. There is a certain honesty in being doctrinaire. I would not accuse the hon. Gentleman of being doctrinaire in any pejorative sense, as I hope that he will be as direct as he usually is in manifesting his feelings. But the idea that powers should be retained by local education authorities both for local convenience, as specified yet again by my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett), and to assist them in tackling the problems of demographic change and falling school rolls which will be with them for some time—and that those powers should remain with the authorities at least until we get the further Act which the hon. Gentleman has promised seems to me to strengthen the Bill in a positive sense. Retention of the powers would assist the local education authorities involved and would make my hon. Friends and me slightly more enamoured of this otherwise repulsive measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sincerely hope that the hon. Gentleman will now either understand the force of my hon. Friend's arguments and make some concession or, alternatively, give us an undertaking that at some future stage he will properly consider—as he has not done so far—the force of the argument of leaving local authorities with powers as specified under the 1976 Act, and will possibly be rather more helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful first debate. I should like to reply to one or two of the specific points made by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a probing amendment at all. The suggestion is seriously made. I fear I got the impression from parts of the hon. Gentleman's reply that the purpose of the amendment had not been fully understood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman constantly said that to accept this amendment would weaken the Bill. I suppose that that is an argument addressed to people who believe in grammar schools; the argument is that the amendment would make it less easy for local education authorities who wanted to wreck comprehensive schools to go ahead and wreck them. But I cannot see
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
quite what the word "weaken" means if the hon. Gentleman has no policy to weaken in the first place. If the Bill is simply intended to allow local option, why not allow those local authorities—the Minister says he wants them to have an option—to exercise their undoubted powers? That is the object of the exercise: to allow them to exercise those powers, with the added convenience of the linkage with section 13 of the 1944 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has said that the Government do not believe that local option in terms of comprehensive education is proper, any more than the drafters of the 1944 Act felt that local option in terms of age was proper. In 1944 they said that the spirit of the elementary school must be got rid of, and that therefore there must be primary schools for children up to 11 years old and secondary schools for children from 11 onwards. There was no local option on that—it was a national policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel much the same and on this issue we believe that we have the electorate behind us, to judge from the number of Conservative and Labour local education authorities which have gone comprehensive. This should cease to be available for local option. The Under-Secretary disagrees with us but this is a perfectly respectable argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was particularly pleased with the forthright statement by the UnderSecretary—we shall bring him back to this from time to time—that local authorities have every right to, as it says in section 1(1) of the Education Act 1976,
	<br><q><p>"have regard to the general principle that such education "—</p></q>
that is, secondary education—
	<br><q><p>"is to be provided in schools where the arrangements for the admission of pupils are not based (wholly or partly) on selection by reference to ability or aptitude."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had better get this perfectly clear. I said that we leave to local education authorities the way in which they want to run their schools and that, if those local education authorities—we are not doctrinaire on this point—with the agreement of the people in that area, want non-selective education they can have it. If they want the retention of selective education they can have that. There is nothing in the Bill which stops them from having selective or non-selective education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0424">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall see what the Under-Secretary said when we read the record if we are allowed to read it tomorrow or as soon as it has been printed. But I had the impression that he said that if a local education authority so wished, it could have regard to that principle in the 1976 Act, but that it did not have to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it is important that we get this matter right. A local education authority could go comprehensive before without anything being in that Act, it could go comprehensive now without anything better in the Bill—it depends upon the area. The difference between the two sides is as I stated earlier and it is as well that we have it clearly stated—the Labour Party overwhelmingly believes that all areas should be comprehensive whether they like this or not. We, too, on this side of the Committee—with much more belief in the freedom of local authorities—do not believe that there is any finite system which has come down on stone tablets from Sinai as to the way in which schools should be run. Local areas should run their schools in the way they want whilst also being responsive to the people in the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that we have got this quite clear. It is an important issue because there may be future litigation about schools. The different way in which judges may look at this matter is that, before 1976, the principles as enshrined in the 1976 Act, the phrase about having regard to non-selective education, had never been inscribed in education law before; having regard to parents' wishes had been; having regard to age, ability and aptitude had been; but having regard to non-selective education had not been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I take it, although the Government are saying, "We want to wipe that off the statute book"—and with their majority they have every right to do so if they wish—they are also saying, at least, I think the Under-Secretary is saying, that, notwithstanding that it be wiped off the statute book, local authorities have the right to have regard to this principle in forming their education policy and creating their schools. That is a very important principle, because although it is disappearing from educational law, the Under-Secretary's statement is significant. That is why I welcomed it so warmly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They have the same power to organise their schools in any way they wish—this is only one of 50 possible ways. This is probably why we won the election and the Labour Party lost. Things change—people want to buy council houses and there are other matters to which references have been made. The question whether an area goes comprehensive or not is entirely up to a particular area—it is not a principle enforced or prohibited by law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be interested to read this because it is important. The Committee of Privileges last year recommended that words spoken in 	<i>Hansard</i> could in future be quoted in the courts whereas they could not before be quoted in the courts without permission of the House. I raised this question over another issue and it was sent to the Committee on Privileges as a matter of privilege.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why, in this kind of area, because litigation may take place about the principles on which these things are based, that I particularly welcomed the first statement made by the Under-Secretary—before he started walking backwards—and I look forward to reading what he actually said. As I understand it, he said that if local authorities want to have regard to that principle in developing their schools—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I deplore seated interventions, from whichever side of the Committee they may come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may start the sentence again. If local authorities wish to have regard to that principle, among other principles, in developing their schools, we have the Minister's statement that they have every right to do so. He stated that if the local people want something it is the Government's policy to go along with it. As shown by my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Mr. Eastham), that is difficult in the Manchester area because the people of Manchester district, which is the local education authority, want comprehensive education and the people of the Greater Manchester council area, which is not a local education authority, do not want comprehensive education. We must not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
say too much about that because I understand the litigation proceeds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is not a simple matter to say, "If the people wish". Because of the sort of crazy local government system wished on us by the Conservative Party in the early 1970's, under which there are so many layers of local government, some people might wish it and some might not. The only safe thing to do is to take the views of the local education authority and to tell all the other local authorities that start intervening in education that they have no 	<i>locus standi</i> whatsoever in the matter. The Conservative Party's encouragement of the meddling of Greater Manchester council in comprehensive schemes all over that area is one of the greatest examples of irresponsibility in which it has been involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not happy that the Under-Secretary of State has fully understood the purport of the amendment. I still feel that the question of leaving the powers to use the machinery with local education authorities might well have the assent of both sides of the Committee if we had more expert opinion—if we had the reforms recommended by the Select Committee on Procedures and could spend the first two or three sittings calling evidence from the local authority associations and so on. We could have heard the opinions of the teachers' and local authority organisations. If we had had that opportunity I believe the amendment might have been fully agreed on both Sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subject to anything that may take place, I am sorry that the amendment has not been accepted, but I am glad that we have received the pledge from the Under-Secretary of State about the right of local authorities. I still consider the amendment to be a good one but I suspect that, on this occasion, we may not wish to press it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment, as with all our amendments, is to try to insert some sanity into the Bill and to try to get some stability, for which I believe there is general approval, into secondary education—to relieve the whole area of education from the great instability to which it has been subjected over recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon . Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price) referred to the Under-Secretary of State's acquaintance with the game of sticking the tail on the donkey. We see things rather differently. I think it is an accurate allusion to use the example of the game of sticking the tail on the donkey and apply it to Conservative education policy in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a profound belief, which the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Science shares with the right hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Sir K. Joseph) and the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley), that we are all born blind and that success should go to those who by great good fortune can stick the tail on the donkey of life—I do not want to extend the analogy too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cunning of the Conservative Party and hon. Gentlemen opposite is not simply to consider life to be one great game of sticking the tail on the donkey, with the equal start of blindfolding. They would keep moving on the donkey around to the great inconvenience of the blindfold participants, and as an exercise of power, those in charge of the donkey who are without blindfolds, would blunt some of the pins by ensuring that people are not given an equal environmental or domestic start while for others there is a chink of light—as the Under-Secretary might say—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0426">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
in the blindfold. That is how we achieve the perpetuation of the kinds of privileges which the Under-Secretary wishes to sustain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The party opposite have repeatedly referred to the desirability—indeed, the laudability—of parental choice. As a parent myself, I concur, within reasonable limits, with the view that parental choice should be extended as far as is possible in keeping with the public good. In their election manifesto, the Conservatives had a great gust of self-righteousness about parental choice. On page 25 of the manifesto, they state:
	<br><q><p>"Extending parents' rights and responsibilities, including their right of choice, will also help raise standards by giving them greater influence over education. Our Parents' Charter will place a clear duty on government and local authorities to take account of parents' wishes when allocating children to schools, with a local appeals system for those dissatisfied."</p></q>
We have yet to see the parents' charter. It is certainly not in any form of legislation, nor even proposed legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But those principles are clearly stated. They have been rehearsed on many occasions by the Under-Secretary of State and the hon. Member for Cardiff, North-West (Mr. Roberts), whose views in this area I have come to respect, at least in certain particulars. Unequivocally the Tory Party has put itself forward as the party of parents' determination. It has done so even to the extent of imposing a clear duty on Government and local authorities to take account of parents' wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment tries to insert into this Bill—which should more properly be entitled, unless the Under-Secretary conclusively demonstrates otherwise, "The Rescue of Grammar Schools in Certain Areas Bill "—precisely what the Conservatives, in their most accommodating, libertarian and electioneering mood, would wish for themselves. They may have doubts about the parenthood of this amendment, but I and my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett) should not make them too prejudiced, and I hope they will accept the amendment. Frankly, I rather doubt it. The amendment takes Tory Party policy at its word and asks the Government to put the meaning in the Bill which has hitherto only been in their mouths.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government do not accept the amendment, given what they have said in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
their election manifesto, and given what they have said otherwise and, indeed, repetitively on Second Reading, there will be a great gaping wound in the credibility of the Tory Party when it presents itself as the party of safeguarding parental interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because the Tory Government do not have the partnership about which the Secretary of State spoke on Second Reading but are engaged by means of the Bill in a conspiracy with the pickled prejudices of Tory education authorities, they are unlikely to accept the amendment. It would insert between the Tory local education authorities and the implementation of their prejudices the right of parents to be fully consulted. The hon. Gentleman knows, those Tory local education authorities know and we know that if parents were given the power of that inhibition on the implementation of Tory educational prejudices, the parents would be able to prevent the perpetuation of selective systems in many areas. Therefore I think it unlikely that the Government will risk their conspiratorial relationship with those Tory-dominated local education authorities. Sadly, therefore, they are unlikely to accept amendments of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local education authorities which will be using Subsection (3) of clause I are fairly easy to identify. They are the authorities which have put and will put their dogmatic prejudices about selection before the good of the children for whom they care or the opinions of parents whom they represent and, indeed, before the good husbandry of public resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be appropriate to refer to the explanatory memorandum of the Bill in connection with this hope to have the consultation of parents. The explanatory memorandum states:
	<br><q><p>"The Bill has no implications either of a financial character or for public service manpower requirements."</p></q>
I suppose that in many respects that is technically correct, but these authorities which are trying to freeze progress towards comprehensive education and to maintain selective systems and which will take full advantage of subsection (3) of clause I are engaging in the most enormous waste of public resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we look at incidents where headmasters and other teachers have been appointed in anticipation of comprehensive reorganisation, where buildings have been constructed or reconstructed to accom-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

modate that reorganisation, we see enormous waste. It is folly to suggest that there is no implication for public service manpower or for public finances. If the Minister doubts that, he has only to look at the evidence provided by my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Young) in the Second Reading debate and by people in that area itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman were to accept these amendments for consultation, not only would it be the fulfilment of a democratic undertaking and of Tory Party policy on these matters; it would also save an incredible amount of money, which the hon. Gentleman is also supposed to be interested in doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the amendment is concerned not so much with the financial waste of certain regressive authorities taking advantage of the Bill but with the implications of the Bill for destabilising the education system yet again. That is the matter which concerns us, as well as the matter of consulting those as concerned as the children in this matter of educational reorganisation—the parents. This is a proposal for parent participation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of schools affected by subsection (3) the parents and children will have prepared themselves for comprehensive reorganisation. That is why subsection (3) is in the Bill—to amend the obligations of the Education Act 1976. Most of those involved, whether parents or children, will be anticipating the transition to comprehensive education under the terms of the 1976 Act with, at Very least, passivity and, in most cases, delight, because it will have released them from the thrall of 1I-plus selection and everything that goes with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A local education authority taking immediate advantage of subsection (3) cannot conceivably have taken any steps whatsoever to consult parents, teachers or, indeed, the children affected by the changes that will be made available through it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that the individuals concerned know best. As recently as 11.20 a.m. this morning—a mere 40 minutes ago—he said that people in the area know what is best for the schooling of the area. This amendment, moved 40 minutes after the hon. Gentleman said that, endorses and upholds that principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I want the hon. Gentleman to do is endorse and uphold that principle, not in the generalised slogans that he could enunciate, but in legislation by accepting the amendments. If, as the hon. Gentleman believes, the individual knows best and people in an area know what is best for the schooling in that area, he should place, by accepting the amendment, an obligation on local education authorities to consult parents and teachers in primary and in secondary schools before taking the retrograde step of applying for revocation of their existing provision, as they would be permitted to do under subsection (3) of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the hon. Gentleman dare to do that? His standing in the Conservative Party on education matters is considerable. By experience and a great deal of hard work, as well as by some thought—which I would not call original but is, nevertheless, studious—he has obtained and deserves to occupy the position of influence that he now has. I am sure that if the hon. Gentleman gave a lead on this matter he would be accorded a great deal of attention and respect throughout the Conservative Party. But dare he make the simple proposition to the local education authorities affected by subsection (3), that they should take full consideration of what the parents and teachers think before taking the step of revocation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the hon. Gentleman dare to stand up for effective choice—not some bland and Vague option of choice which the Tory Party is fond of talking about, but effective choice in a real education situation against the tangible prospect of people's lives being changed by the act of revocation? Dare he stand up for effective choice? Dare he be a Daniel for parent participation and for democracy in education? Dare he go into the various lions' dens of Tory-dominated local education authorities—perhaps, more appropriately, they should be called snake pits—and stand up for the real rights of parents?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dare the hon. Gentleman stand up for the rights of not just some parents who occupy a position of influence in the local Tory-held councils, or some of the more articulate parents who are capable of venting their feelings in a most effective and impressive way, but the right of all those parents and children involved in, and affected by, the act of revocation? That is not a bad educational principle
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0428">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
and not a bad political principle. It is a fine democratic principle, and one which I would expect the hon. Gentleman and the Under-Secretary of State for Wales to embrace with great cheerfulness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, does the Under-Secretary of State dare to go to Bolton, or to Salop, which were due to go comprehensive in September this year? Does he dare to go to Wirral or to Cumbria, which are due to go comprehensive next year? Does he dare go to any of the others and tell the Tory-dominated local education authorities that they cannot dissolve the comprehensive idea as Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries without taking into account the people most directly affected?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the hon. Gentleman tell them that these are the 1970s, not the 1530s, and that the fiat and the implied prejudice of the Tory-dominated local education authority simply will not be enough? Will he, as a democrat, as someone very recently elected, as someone with a mandate, as someone who has set his hand to the undertaking to impose a clear duty on Government and local authorities to take account of parents' wishes, tell those local authorities, through the medium of the Bill as amended, that they have to consult parents and teachers before taking the step of revocation? Will he do that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is necessary because, regardless of what a future Labour Government may do, the lives of those children who are formed educationally during the lifetime of this Government and of this legislation will be changed by the action taken as a consequence of the application of clause 3(1). Their futures will be diverted—perhaps even distorted—by the fact that, if approval is revoked in some areas, they may be subjected to II-plus selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not talking of a temporary, short-term, transitory or emergency measure for the fulfilment of an undertaking given in the manifesto. We are talking about the effect of the Bill on the lives of many thousands of children now aged seven, eight, nine, I0 or 11, who will be reaching maturity when we next get a Labour Government and have a chance to invert the prejudices of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the hon. Gentleman dare—the task would take almost bionic strength—go to Kingston upon Thames and tell the tricorne-hatted blimps who run that local education authority that they must take the parents' wishes into account? The hon.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
Gentleman knows what I am talking about. That authority has an infamous reputation as the only local authority in the whole of Britain that has no comprehensive schooling whatsoever. If the parents' wishes were taken into account in Kingston upon Thames that authority, following the consultations which it would be obliged to enter into under the Bill if the hon. Gentleman accepted the amendment, would have to start rolling treaclily towards comprehensive education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman is trying to "pursue excellence"—I use his words—he should discover what the parents deem to be excellence. I am sure he will accept that they are at least as concerned about the future of their children as he is. I wonder whether the Secretary of State for Education and Science spoke for the hon. Gentleman when he said, on Second Reading, that he wanted to:
	<br><q><p>"restore to local education authorities and to local people "—</p></q>
I emphasise "to local people "—
	<br><q><p>"the right to choose the type of secondary education they wish to have in their areas."</p></q>
Did the hon. Gentleman agree with the Secretary of State when he said:
	<br><q><p>"the real question is not the label "—</p></q>
that is to say, on the schools—
	<br><q><p>"but whether they are good schools providing an education suited to the needs of their pupils and to the satisfactions of their parents."</p></q>
I emphasise
	<br><q><p>"and to the satisfactions of their parents."</p></q>
Did the hon. Gentleman agree with his right hon. Friend when he said:
	<br><q><p>"It is parents and not politicians who should be given the opportunity to choose the school best suited to their child."</p></q>
I am sure that there is a positive and fraternal alliance between the hon. Gentleman and the Secretary of State but these matters need some further consideration in the context of this amendment and the clause. I understand why the hon. Gentleman and the Secretary of State have talked about local people. That is a defensive tactic which has been adopted by the Tory Party in response to the frequent challenges it has had from my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mr. Flannery) and others, who have asked the hon. Gentleman and many of his right hon. and hon. Friends why, if they wish to remove compulsion from local education authorities, they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0429">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
wish to compel local housing authorities to sell council houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman and his right hon. Friends, in reaction to that forceful question, have said that they are concerned, not simply for the local authorities but for a sovereign power beyond them, the people, the individuals, the electors, the citizens. That is a Very laudable view. It is a populist View, and it is an appealing view to anybody who sits in this House and wants to serve people. But it has been necessary because hon. Members opposite recognise the inconsistency of their position on housing, as opposed to education. Thus, they have had to talk about local people in a way that they probably would not have had to do otherwise had they not been forced into defensive positions because of their policy of directing local council housing authorities to sell houses if people want to buy them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government say that an authority beyond the decision of the local council must prevail—the authority and the desire of the electors. As I have said, that is a difficult proposition to contest, but if it is upheld by the Government it is a proposition that they have to observe universally. If the hon. Gentleman says that the Government want to serve the popular interest and force recalcitrant Labour councillors to sell their council houses, he has to say that, in the popular interest and in order to provide parents with power of participation in the future of their children, the very least the Government can do is to impose the featherlight obligation upon local education authorities, before taking the step of revocation of comprehensive schooling, to consult fully the parents and the teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, the strongest argument for accepting the amendment are the words of the hon. Gentleman and the Secretary of State and because it is they who have enshrined the view that the power of the tenant, the power of the parent, the power of the people most directly affected, of the local people, of parents not politicians, must prevail in these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that when on Second Reading the Secretary of State said:
	<br><q><p>"It is parents and not politicians who should be given the opportunity to choose the school best suited to their child",</p></q>
he was not just talking about the politicians on the Government Front Bench. I am
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
sure he was not just talking about the politicians on the Government Back Benches in the Conservative Central Office or in the Institute of Economic Affairs. He was also thinking about the politicians who sit on the local education authority committees and that the parents wishes should prevail against them, if the two—their wishes and the parents' wishes—were in contradiction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman believes that the parents' wishes should prevail and that the parents should be taken into full participation, if he believes that a partnership should exist between a freedom-loving Government and freedom-loving people, I should be interested to know his response to the findings in an area in which 4,590 questionnaires were sent out to parents of primary, grammar and secondary school pupils as recently as July 1978. In that area, there was a 32 per cent. response to the questionnaire from parents of 1,482 children. Thirty two per cent., as any statistician would inform the hon. Gentleman, is not a bad rate of return on a very detailed questionnaire, a copy of which I can show him if he wishes to see it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of those replies 60 per cent. of all parents, 71 per cent. of non-grammar school parents whose children were attending secondary schools, and 75 per cent. of the parents of primary school children wanted comprehensive schooling in their area by September 1980. A further 30 per cent. wanted it by 1982. Only 10 per cent. of all the parents responding to that detailed questionnaire replied that they never wanted comprehensive schooling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether the Minister considers that such a response was a fair system of consultation, and whether it was a fair manifestation of opinion, especially since it has been properly and scientifically analysed by professional statisticians. The interest of those who promoted this questionnaire is not to come to any distorted conclusion, because they believe that the best and greatest strength of their arguments is accuracy of compilation and fairness in question asking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman considered that that was a fair manifestation of parental opinion, and that it was a sufficiently exhaustive method of seeking to consult parents and establish their beliefs, and if he wanted to act on the basis of it, he would have to say to the Kingston local
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0430">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
education authority, "These are the results of an intensive examination of parent opinion in the north of Kingston and you had better get on with providing comprehensive education in that area."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speak with a particular knowledge and passion on this matter. I have two children in a first-class primary school in Kingston. They are faced with the prospect of sitting the 11-plus and going through the selective system. I and my wife, who is equally anxious to secure change in this respect, with another 1,481 parents, responded to that questionnaire. With the overwhelming majority of those who responded, I want change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Ministers really mean what they say about putting parents first, and if they imposed an obligation for consultation, as proposed in their party's manifesto, to take account of parents' wishes, they would have to respond to a campaign and an opinion of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, if the hon. Gentleman were to gird his loins, his courage and his conviction—I am sure it is his conviction; I cannot believe otherwise—and say that he intends to implement his view on the necessity of parental consultation, not only would he have to go to Kingston, but he would have to give a very positive response to the questions posed by the current events in Erith, in the Bexley local education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the newspapers on 26th June presented the hon. Gentleman with a certain discomfort. We are in the most sensitive process of debating this Bill, and have heard from the hon. Gentleman and nearly all of his hon. Friends—the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) is an exception, as he is to most rules. Most of the hon. Gentlemen on this Committee must have been embarrassed by the brazen honesty of a fellow member of the Conservative Party in Erith, Mr. Brian Sams, and his colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the classic case with which subsection (3), and the whole question of parent consultation and of teacher consultation is involved. It is almost as if we were in a laboratory doing a test on the implications of this Bill, examining the matter not politically but forensically. In the interests of science—fortunately—and in the interests of parents and childrenunfortunately—an example has been provided for us by the schools in Erith.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Mr. Sams was asked—I quote
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
from 	<i>The Guardian</i> of 26th June—whether his attempts to restore grammar school education were
	<br><q><p>"inconsistent with statements by the Education Secretary, Mr. Mark Carlisle, about not going back on comprehensive education, Mr. Sams said: 'That is just the noise a Tory Secretary of State makes. I can't see that he would oppose it.'"</p></q>
I hope that he would oppose it. Now, the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Secretary of State is a smooth man, while his hon. Friend, whom we have the pleasure to have with us today in Committee, is an hairy man. But if the Under-Secretary is an hairy man, then Mr. Brian Sams is positively anthropoid. Mr. Sams does not even have the sensitivity or the delicacy to understand that it is not particularly favourable to his friends, the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary, to make confessions of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What do they want? They want—for invented reasons which have nothing to do with the real reason for the Tories in Erith wanting, not so much to turn the clock back as to throw the clock out of the window—to restore the grammar schools. Mr. Sams said that it would be "a tidying-up operation" if the two schools were to revert from being part of a comprehensive system to being the grammar school and secondary modern school that they were previously. I suppose it is the same kind of tidying-up operation that the United States Air Force performed on Hiroshima in 1945. The intention, of course, is to flatten the advance of comprehensive education in that part of the borough of Bexley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Sams says that the reason is that the schools are "too big "—even though there are two schools, they are too big—and that the two sites on which they reside are inconvenient. That inconvenience is shared by many other schools, though I understand that there is a lot of organisational facility in that school for overcoming those difficulties. Another reason, he said, was that
	<br><q><p>"parents in the north of the borough were not getting the sort of grammar school education they wanted."</p></q>
Those are the ostensible reasons. However, much more relevant is the fact that over the years Mr. Sams has been prominent in his continual opposition by tooth and nail to comprehensive education. He is entitled to do that. There is no
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0431">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
quarrel with the individual right to conduct that fight. Our quarrel is with the kind of arguments he is adducing. It is an important matter, because they are the kind of arguments that this Bill invites.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We said on Second Reading that the Bill is a threat to the whole comprehensive school system, and the hon. Gentleman and his hon Friends denied it. But it is a threat. This is the rotten apple that is being deliberately put into the barrel. It is not a question of the apple being deposited there by accident, or the apple becoming rotten because it is exposed to sunlight, or for any other reason of contamination; no, the Under-Secretary is digging down into the barrel, carefully selecting a rotten apple, sticking it in and then crowding the good apples back on it, in the hope that the germs will spread. That is the impact of the Bill, especially when it provides an opportunity for people with the bald simple-mindedness of Mr. Brian Sams.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
His arguments are effectively answered, in the first instance, by Mr. Brian Pimm, the head of the schools since 1972—not some recently appointed, permissive, unauthoritative new boy, but the headmaster of those schools for seven years. I quote from the 	<i>Daily Mail—I</i> suppose that it is safe to do so in spite of that newspaper's record. Mr. Pimm said:
	<br><q><p>"It is a retrograde step"—</p></q>
that refers to Mr. Sams' proposals—
	<br><q><p>"and pupils will lose out if the school is split in two again. In the last decade the school has streaked ahead academically."</p></q>
I realise that, by some, the headmaster might be considered not to be an exactly objective witness. I do not think that the Under-Secretary of State would feel like that. I think that he would concur with me that this headmaster, like most other headmasters, will seek to uphold the best interest of the children in his care. Clearly, Mr. Pym feels that that duty is best fulfilled by preventing revocation—by preventing any step backward as demanded by Mr. Sams.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has indicated that he would only accept the kind of move proposed by Mr. Sams if it were in accord with the wishes of the parents. In that case, what do the parents have to say? For example, what do they have to say in reaction to Mr. Sams' assertion that there was great dissatisfaction because parents
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
in the north of the borough were not getting the sort of grammar school education that they wanted?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fortunately, in 	<i>The Guardian</i> this morning Mrs. J. Woods of Bexleyheath writes to say:
	<br><q><p>"Sir,—So the leopard is changing his spots already".</p></q>
I hope that that is not a pejorative reference to the hon. Gentleman. I have always thought of him more as a bruin than as a leopard. Mrs. Woods continues:
	<br><q><p>"Despite our being assured by Mrs. Thatcher before the election that she favoured choice in education, Bexley Conservative Council is proposing to dismantle its one real all-ability school. Once again we have Jekyll and Hyde politics with the interests of the children being outweighed by doctrinaire considerations.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>"Some parents have already seen older children's education disrupted when it was first reorganised from grammar/secondary modern to all-ability. Now they can watch an action replay for their younger children with the drop in staff morale, endless committee meetings about the future of resources and staff.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>"The chairman of the local education committee "—</p></q>
—Mr. Sams, of course—
	<br><q><p>"tells us that parents in the north of the borough are just not getting the sort of grammar school education they want. Who says so? Last week 35 children sat their maths 'O' level one year early, as well as the usual complement taking it in the fifth year. As well as the three science subjects and the usual maths, English, etc., all children in the academic stream are able to study two languages all the way through the school.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>"If this isn't a grammar school type of education, what is? As a mere parent, perhaps I shouldn't comment on these matters, but I do wish the political parties would leave their bayonets at the door and consider our children and not their doctrines."</p></q>
That, whilst passionate, is dispassionate in its attitude towards the views of education that the Labour Party has upheld and also those which the Conservative Party upholds. Here, a woman is expressing, directly, honestly and convincingly, her great concern about the prospect of further unnecessary change, and providing evidence to indicate that either Mr. Sams does not know what is being provided in the school or, for reasons best known to himself, is prepared to try to overlook it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the test is not the attitude of Mr. Brian Pym, the headmaster. He has better things to do than fight defensive actions against the militant Toryism of Mr. Sams. As a headmaster, he has much better things to do with his time, as I am sure he would be prepared to say. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0432">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
test is not the fact that we can rely on the chairman of the school governors, the Rev Keith Johnson. He, too, has better things to do with his time. Clearly, we cannot leave it to Mr. Sams and we should not have to rely on evidence of protest in letters in 	<i>The Guardian</i> or in any other newspaper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this respect, the finger of decision points directly at the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary of State—they have to take the decision. Either they have to go on nursing the idea and encouraging Tory councils into believing that they can turn back the educational progress and reorganisation of their areas that has been made in recent years, or they should now come out very clearly—by statement or by circular but in either event very quickly—and say, "The only Stimulus we will respect, the only initiative that we will accept, the only mobilisation of opinion that we will recognise in pursuit of change backwards towards a selective system is one which clearly and spontaneously comes from parents."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can the hon. Gentleman establish that? He can do it by accepting the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend and me, either in this precise form of words or with something which is legally more acceptable, but certainly enSconcing the principle of no revocation before full consultation with parents. ThiS is a fair principle to uphold and one which I commend to the Under-Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard from the Tories during Second Reading—we will hear it again in Committee and for some years to come—that they are not inspired by dogma or by doctrine, that their considerations are solely educational. As I said earlier, I would not mind if they were inspired by dogma or doctrine. In a mature democracy it is up to the people to judge their choice of doctrines and I believe that this is the adult choice which must be put before the people. I do not quarrel with the right of people to hold do dogma, although, obviously, I quarrel with the views which they hold. Therefore, I do not object to Governments pursuing courses for dogmatic or doctrinaire reasons—that is the right of their mandate about the hon. Gentle-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
man and his hon. Friends are fond of talking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I abhor and deeply object to is the dressing up of political rodents as educational mink. I deeply abhor the failure of honesty, by which I mean a Government pursuing a doctrinaire course for reasons of political prejudice but trying continually to represent that as a dispassionate, humane, democratic attempt to advance educational Standards. I want the Under-Secretary to come off that nonsense—I believe that he is honest enough to do so—to accept the amendment and to give the reassurance to parents that there cannot be any further dramatic change, backwards or forwards, without intense consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence of democracy is Strongly for it. Indeed, the evidence of the hon. Gentleman's own party's election manifesto makes any other course unthinkable I want him not simply to give us vague assurances but to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Greenway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: have listened with great interest to the most eloquent remarks of the hon. Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock) and his reference to the democratic process. I listened with particular interest to what he had to say about parental petitions to assert the comprehensive principle in Kingston. Whatever the hon. Gentleman may think about that authority, it must be admitted that again and again it has been elected on its mandate to run the Schools in the way in which it is running them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would also point out to the hon. Gentleman, again and again and not very far from here either, parents have got up petitions to Save the excellent schools which their children attend and that such petitions have been ignored. They have been ignored by the local authorities concerned on the basis that they have been elected to run their schools according to the pattern which they have chosen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill—again I point this out to the hon. Gentleman—the local authorities will at least be able to respond to pressure to make change, whereas, under the 1976 Act which is being amended, there is no possibility of change. I do not see the democratic principle at work in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0433">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
If one looks closely at the amendment, one is reminded that parents are Voters. In many cases, where parents have been dissatisfied with what has been going on in the organisation of Schools in an area, they have become involved in the democratic process, elected people to councils and pushed for the sort of school organisation they want. It is up to the hon. Gentleman to do that in Kingston.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How far is the hon. Gentleman going to take that? I am Sure he, as much as anyone, is familiar with the necessity to be Sensitive to the needs and aspirations of particular areas. Some areas may be working class, some middle class. Some have schools close at hand, others do not. Some may vote Tory. Some may Vote Liberal. Some may vote Labour. We are talking generally about catchment areas, certainly in the case of Kingston and in most other places. Therefore, is the hon. Gentleman saying that the writ of the overweening authority of the Kingston borough council must run, on the basis that in the authority as a whole Conservatives have secured a majority over several years—since 1947, as far as I can make out—or will he indicate his Sensitivity and acknowledge that there are differences in particular areas?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, in Kingston, in the area in which the parents' questionnaire was taken up, which is a naturally defined area in the north of Kingston, the Conservatives currently have a slight majority, but this is not a usual Set of circumstances. Sometimes the Liberals have a few more seats than they have now, sometimes the Labour Party has a few more. How far will the hon. Gentleman take this business of a political mandate when it is applied to the Specific requirements of education when the aspirations of parents may be in contradiction to the general attitude which they take towards politics, as, indeed, they have every right to be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Greenway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer must be to ask the hon. Gentleman to consider the large number of Labour authorities which have not responded to sensitive parts of their local government areas over many years, and have imposed upon them the type of School and organisation of school that they felt themselves
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
elected to impose upon the whole area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, parents are voters. Secondly, to bring in teachers as a second line of consultation seems unnecessary. Teachers are on almost every governing body of Schools in the country. They are already thoroughly consulted there. I assure the hon. Gentleman, as one who has been in schools for the past 22 years, that teachers who are on governing bodies have to be responsive to their colleagues in what they say, or they cease to sit on the governing bodies concerned. Again, teachers are represented, sometimes with voting rights, on local education authorities throughout the country and they are consulted. I do not see the need to extend that representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to talk of the democratic principle, we must mean what we say and respond to those who elect local authorities to run education along the lines by which they have sought election. We must stand by that ultimate democratic process. The Bill will allow them to do exactly that and for that reason I welcome it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I speak to both amendments, but particularly to amendment No. 4.

It is extremely important that local authorities carry out this level of consultation. That is something to which the party opposite seems very firmly committed as a principle. Therefore, I should have hoped that as we are hearing speeches criticising it, the Government would welcome the amendment and assure us that there will be local consultation. I should like to know what that local consultation will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Between 1970 and 1974, the then Secretary of State seemed to believe in local consultation on the basis that She contacted one or two of her own friends and asked them what they thought about proposals. If they did not like the proposals, she vetoed them, even though they were put forward by Conservative authorities and had considerable backing from the local community. It seems to me very important to find out what the Conservative Party means by the slogan that we heard earlier "power to the people "—consultation with local people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely the easiest method is to use the local authority as the group to be consulted. But we clearly have problems

there. Very often, a local authority is elected for a whole series of reasons. One can find considerable differences within the Conservative Party. For instance, there is the area of Macclesfield. I am glad to see that the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) has returned and is now taking an interest. Very recently his voters re-elected him to this House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be interested to know, as I trust you are, Miss Fookes, that I have just been out photocopying a petition which I have received from over 200 girls of the Macclesfield high School for girls, objecting to Cheshire county council's plans for that school to go comprehensive later this year. While indeed I have been absent from the Committee for a little while, I was engaged in matters relating to education, and I do react—I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree—to the representations made to me by my constituents, who may not share the hon. Gentleman's support for a compulsory, all-in comprehensive scheme. In Macclesfield, strong representations are being made to its Member of Parliament about the country's proposals. I believe that it is my duty to ensure that those representations are fully considered at the highest level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear how active the hon. Gentleman has been, because he illustrates my point very nicely. As I was saying, the electors of Macclesfield very recently re-elected him to the House. I have a strong feeling that during his election campaign he expressed his reservations about the comprehensive principle. But a short time before that they voted in the elections for the Cheshire county council, where again they returned Conservative representatives but who were committed to a policy of continuing comprehensive education in that county.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Wintertion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There Seems to be Some dilemma there, because Surely it is a Conservative-controlled county council in Cheshire which is carrying out the reorganisation in that area. Therefore, we have here a difficulty of a party with two
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
policies. If the Secretary of State consults, which part of the Conservative Party does he consult? Does he consult the part of the party represented by its Members of Parliament, or does he consult the part represented by its county councillors, who stood on a policy of the county council's Conservatives?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am happy to port, North (Mr. Bennett) that only two county councillors representing my constituency Serve on the education committee. Those who represent the town of Macclesfield, where the main opposition to comprehensive education lies, do not serve on the education committee, and when this matter wasconsidered by the county council as a whole, they voted against the all-in comprehensive proposals of the Cheshire county council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the hon. Member that the Cheshire county council continued with its comprehensive Schemes and reorganisation proposals because it felt that it was legally obliged to do so under the penal provisions of the Education Act 1976, which this Bill Seeks to remove. My area and those who represent my constituency on the Cheshire county council have, in the majority, been opposed to an all-comprehensive reorganisation of secondary education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Conservative Party in Cheshire has a very honourable reputation as one of those authorities which pioneered comprehensive education. It certainly carried out comprehensive reorganisation in that part of Cheshire which is now within Stockport. The local community would be very pleased now to defend Bramhall comprehensive School and others in that area.

If one goes to Various parts of Cheshire which are either within the old county boundaries of Cheshire or within the new ones, one finds that areas which regularly return Conservative county councillors Support the comprehensive principle. It is clear that in that county the majority of the Conservative county councillors remain in favour of going

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>51</span>
ahead with this reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to consult merely by consulting the county council—the elected education authority. There is also the problem, which was illustrated by interventions, whether one consults the county council, which represents a wide area of greatly differing interests, or whether one consults the district council. Certainly my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, South (Mr. Marshall) has experienced this problem, whereby, because of the gerrymandering of the authorities, Leicester lost its education function and now suffers because it is part of a county which does not have a very progressive education policy in many areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to correct my hon. Friend, but nothing that I said in my intervention meant to imply or implied that the Leicestershire county council did not have a progressive educational system. I Said that there was a difference of opinion over what kind of progressive System should operate between the county areas and the city areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to my hon. Friend. It is a question of the views in the two areas that presents some difficulty. If one does not automatically consult the local education authority one has to look carefully at whom one will consult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my amendment I set out a series of groups of people with whom one should consult. I think that they should be put down in a waiting order. The hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) made the point that he had received a petition from the girls who were already at the Schools. That is a group of people who need to be consulted least because in all the changes to comprehensive education one the fundamental principles has been that things have not been altered for those children who have already arrived at the Secondary stage. Changes have been phased in such a way that those children who were admitted to a grammar school continued to enjoy the privileges that might have been given them, right the way through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems is that people call Such Schools comprehensive schools
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
once the first intake is comprehensive. But it may be that the rest of the School is nowhere near comprehensive. It can be Strongly argued that Some of the criticisms that have been made recently of comprehensive schools have been made because the results are Still being achieved by what are former Selective pupils who are passing through those schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, those children who have already reached the grammar school are those who need to be consulted least because, as it were, they are guaranteed by the System that they will continue to pass through the educational System which they opted for at that particular point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman displaying a true knowledge of the situation? Is it not true that those pupils who are facing 0-level and A-level examinations within 12 months could not have their courses severely disrupted by reorganisation? Despite what the hon. Gentleman says, there are quite a number of people within the teaching profession who do not like comprehensive education, who have grave reservations about it. These teachers could well leave the school to seek appointments elsewhere which could create considerable disruption at a sensitive time for those pupils who are facing serious public examinations within a short period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the sad features in schools is that teachers tend to move. Some of them may move for that reason but I have a suspicion that far more are likely to move because they want promotion. Presumably they do not say to themselves, "We will not seek promotion this year because it might harm our group of pupils." They do not say that because realistically that is one of the problems for a teacher who is seeking promotion. The move from one school to another may occur at a particularly unfortunate time for some group of children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does it not cross my hon. Friend's mind that the mobility of teachers may have increased this year in view of the fears over job opportunities in the teaching profession as a consequence of reduction in public expenditure, particularly on education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0436">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>53</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a valid point. I also make the point to the hon. Member for Macclesfield that the fact that some teachers are moving might actually steadily improve the educational attainments of pupils reaching examination level. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can cast his mind back to the school he attended. I suspect that one or two of his teachers may not have been of the highest calibre. He might have done better if one or two of them had moved on elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only because a Labour Member of the last Parliament happened to be a teacher at the school which I attended. But I am sure that the hon. Gentleman regrets his departure because of his defeat at the general election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flannery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we set up in Sheffield our very first comprehensive school—it was one of the first complete purpose-built comprehensives in the country—I believe that my hon. Friend was vice-chairman of the education committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Deputy chairman. We had no vices in Sheffield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flannery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We inquired where the applications to teach in the comprehensive came from. At that time we had in Sheffield King Edward's grammar school, which—so far as most of us know—catered for Sandhurst and Oxbridge. It took the top 5 per cent. of boys in the city and streamed them. The biggest block of applications for posts in the first comprehensive school came from King Edward's grammar school, because teachers knew that they would have better facilities than there were in that school and—as a matter of fact—better wages. That was told me by the chairman of the education committee. That was why those teachers moved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention. The point is quite clear. Those children who have already attained secondary schools will not suffer from any proposals for reorganisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can vouch for the example of Sheffield, where I had some responsibility for the education committee. Also, in London, when Tulse Hill school was set up almost in the constituency of the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Shelton), the majority of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
the senior posts when the school was initially set up were filled by teachers not even from a local authority grammar school but from Dulwich College. Senior masters from Dulwich College felt that they would have far wider scope and far better prospects if they moved out of the private sector into the greater opportunities of the public sector comprehensive system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. We are certainly establishing the fact that those children who are already in the secondary schools have little to fear from reorganisation. Those pupils probably have more to benefit from than any chance of losing, unless people such as the hon. Member for Macclesfield go around giving out scare stories so that they suddenly feel that they need to get up a petition. No doubt they would not organise their petition in school time or in time when they could usefully be doing their homework. No doubt it would be a further activity. But there is a danger that if they are frightened by bogus stories about how they are going to suffer they may well damage their school careers. No damage, however, is likely to result from reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that if the Minister is going to carry out this consultation, he should consult least those pupils who are actually in the school, because, in all the proposals, they have a guarantee that they will not suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next group the Minister ought to consult is the community interests. Again, however, there is a danger in consulting the community interests. It is clear that some people in the community rush to the defence of a grammar school for the simple reason that they went to that school. In fact, the only thing they achieved was to go to that school. They therefore feel that their status is threatened if it is threatened. They do not consider at all the educational questions involved. If one consults the community, one must ask people what their real reasons are for being doubtful, or having any fears, about the comprehensive system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next three groups of people who ought to be consulted are, in my view, much more important. First there are the teachers who work both in the schools that are being reorganised and in the primary schools. They have a right to be consulted. If one is to get them to work
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0437">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>55</span>
to their optimum, those consultations must be real and valuable with a view to carrying a majority of teachers along with the proposals being put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is important that those consultations are spaced over a particular time limit, so that teachers do not feel—as happens in many local authorities—that they are always being consulted but that no notice is taken of those consultations and political decisions are being made without taking the consultations into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next group I would consult is the primary schools. The primary schools—being the schools which feed the secondary Schools—haVe much concern about the comprehensive principle. There is a lot of evidence that, where selection remains, the greatest damage it does is to the curriculum and teaching methods in primary schools. Pressure is on the school to try to achieve what are considered to be the best results—in other words, to get more children into the grammar school, even though it may be educationally wrong to get a child through. If a child is crammed through and sent to the wrong school, that child will live to regret it ever after.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Often in primary schools which still have selection far too much of the timetable is given to cramming children in order to pass a particular examination, rather than to giving a wide range to the child's education. In particular, there are questions about the teaching of French in primary schools. If French is taught in primary schools, it involves giving a guarantee that the children will get the opportuntty to study French in secondary schools. It also involves giving a guarantee that the teaching methods will be compatible, because there is a danger that when primary schools introduce French they just take off the novelty value and do not achieve the basic grounding which helps the children to get on in the secondary school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same can be said of the introduction of sciences in primary schools. There is a good argument for the introduction of science into primary schools, but again it should be done taking into account the sort of curriculum that those children will enjoy when they move on to secondary school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I worked on a survey of fifth-form pupils concerning the history studies they had
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
done. I discovered that they had studied the Vikings on about five different occasions, over the infant, primary and Various stages of their secondary school, and yet had little or no knowledge of nineteenth century history. That, in my view, might have been of more use to them, but it is perhaps not as easy to teach with models, charts, diagrams, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The biggest snag with the selective system is that it causes problems in the curriculum within the primary schools. So the primary schools need to he consulted very carefully, particularly with a view to freeing them from the burden of a selective examination or the burden of keeping records which are gauged purely to divide people into categories A or B. In my view, that is a wasteful way of using teachers' resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the most important people to be consulted are the parents of those children who are likely to attend the schools in question over the next five, I0, or 15 years. That group really has a right to be consulted, because those are the people whose children's futures are at stake. So I believe Very strongly that local consultations should take place with these groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the matters on which those groups should be consulted. In my opinion, the most important matter is the resources that local authorities will put into those schools. The real telling blow to the old selective system is that most local authorities were never fair in their allocation of resources between grammar and secondary schools. Almost all local authorities treated the secondary modern schools as second best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government go ahead with their intention to revoke this approval, they should make a clear statement to parents that, in the allocation of teachers, there will be the same pupil-teacher ratio in the grammar school as in the secondary modern school. In that way, at least some justice can be done. But the records of most local authorities which still have selective schools show that the pupil-teacher ratio is still far from favourable in the grammar school than it is in the secondary modern school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
