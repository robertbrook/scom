</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Goodhew. The Committee is in great difficulty, partly because the <i>Official Report</i> of the last siting of the Committee on Tuesday is not available. I am sure, Mr. Goodhew, that you appreciate the problems that Members have at the best of times, but I am sure also that you appreciate that unemployment and employment measures are at the heart of a great deal of controversy in this Parliament and that the Committee has suffered many difficulties, which we have raised from time to time.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) earlier suggested that we should have in the Committee the sort of thing that one sees on the wonderful American TV programme "Soap", so that we could start off each day's proceedings with a sort of flash-back of what went before to bring everybody up to date.<br><br>
Our problems are compounded this morning by the fact that we are discussing Government amendment No. 129, an extremely important amendment. My right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster rose on a point of order at our last sitting on Tuesday night to protest about the late tabling of that Government amendment and the fact that it threw the Opposition into great difficulties.<br><br>
To be as kind as I possibly can to the Secretary of State for Employment, his presentation of the Government amendment on Tuesday night was appalling. I intervened at the time to point out that we are anxious to receive the copy of the <i>Official Report</i> of the proceedings so that we could read what he had said because none of us could understand him. That amendment, No. 129, is before the Committee this morning. Without the <i>Official Report,</i> it is impossible to come to terms with what it means. Therefore, to help us in our dilemma, might I suggest that the Under-Secretary now re-presents the Government's arguments in justification for amendment No. 129? Otherwise, I should be tempted to move that the Committee adjourn until such time as the <i>Official Report</i> is available.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1005">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 937</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Chair is only too well aware of the difficulties caused when right hon. and hon. Members are not in possession of the <i>Official Report</i> of previous sittings. It puts the Chair in a difficult position as well when the Chair has changed hands. The Chair is therefore very much aware of the difficulties.<br><br>
Unfortunately, the Chair is not in control of the printers. They are under great pressure with the large number of Standing Committees sitting at this time, and I understand that our <i>Hansard</i> people have been pressing the printers to try to get the report through in time for this morning's sitting. I still hope that it may be here in the course of our proceedings, at mid-morning or some time like that. But I cannot guarantee it.<br><br>
Obviously, I cannot force the Under-Secretary to speak unless he is prepared to do so. We shall just have to see how things go. But I assure the hon. Member that the Chair is most anxious that the Committee should have its work made as easy as possible, and does not lightly take the sort of situation in which we are today and will try to avoid it whenever possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Giles Radice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are in some difficulty, Mr. Goodhew. Of course, we entirely accept what you say, but the trouble is that the Secretary of State is always far better at the broad-brush approach, a sort of bluff farmer's approach, to problems, rather than the detailed exposition which we have come to learn to love from the hon. and learned Gentleman. Without flattering him too much, I hope that he will try to explain what the Secretary of State was trying to tell us on Tuesday evening. I do not think that any of us understood it, and I am certain that hon. Gentlemen behind him did not understand it. Many of them were not there in any case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State did not understand it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Radice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, he certainly did not. It would be extremely useful to have a recapitulation from the hon. and learned Gentleman.<br><br>
As I understood it, the Government's amendments have extended the exclusion of rights—an extremely sinister phrase—from all employees in new small undertakings to all employees joining all small firms under the definition in the clause.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 938</span>
That is a major change to introduce at this stage. It amounts to a great diminution of rights, and we are talking about the 4 million or so who work in small firms of that kind.<br><br>
I am still not clear, and I do not think that any member of the Committee is clear—my right hon. Friend tried to elicit some clarification on the point—whether the amendment applies to all employees or just those who are joining. It did not come over clearly and we should like a definition.<br><br>
We deplore this type of legislation by amendment and addition. It is becoming too much a habit in industrial legislation in this Session of Parliament. First, we had a consultative document on secondary action, and we have the promise of further amendments. Now we have this amendment diminishing the rights of employees in small firms at the behest, I understand, of the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Madel). It is a bit worrying that the Secretary of State yields so quickly to pressure of that kind when he takes no notice of Opposition amendments. Perhaps there are some backstairs or understairs deals going on which the Committee does not know about.<br><br>
We also have the prospect of further legislation by amendment—we do not know in what form—if the Secretary of State loses his battle in the Cabinet with the Prime Minister on the general issues. This is not the way to proceed. It indicates a muddled approach, an indecisiveness and, indeed, a weakness that it should happen. In certainly indicates a woeful ignorance of industrial relations.<br><br>
I am speaking to amendment No. 99, to delete lines 37 to 43, which is linked with other amendments designed to mitigate and improve the clause. Once again, as with clause 5, we are debating something for which the Government have produced no evidence. They merely say that they have a hunch that things are like this and therefore they should try to exclude people from rights which they formerly had. There is no concrete evidence that the unfair dismissal provisions have had a disincentive effect on employment in small firms.<br><br>
The Government have produced no evidence because they have none, and they know it. Their case rests upon what the hon. and learned Gentleman has called psychology—I think that it was my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1006">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 939</span>
East (Mr. Leighton) who called it "kidology"—the idea being that if the law on dismissals is changed to benefit employers in small firms, small firms will become anxious to take on extra workers. That is the Government's theory.<br><br>
Of course, we on these Opposition Benches believe strongly in the importance of small firms in the economy. However, perhaps because we are more in touch with the problems of small firms, we know that they are far more influenced by high interest rates, by the loans that they are able or unable to get from the banks, by the attitude of the financial institutions towards them and by the general state of depression in the country than they are by any change in legislation. The Government's theory begs the question whether small firms are actually aware of the legal requirements. If there is any hard evidence at all, it is that small firms are not very knowledgeable about law. To my mind, that was the chief evidence that came from the ORC survey.<br><br>
In any case, there is an internal contradiction in the Government's argument. They say that they are anxious to encourage small firms to take on extra workers. That is very laudable. Yet, if they are right in their belief that small firms are influenced by changes of legislation, what they are doing is applying a new barrier of 20 for employers taking on extra workers. It was 19 but it will now be 20, or is it 21?—I am not absolutely certain. If a small employer who now has 19 employees takes on an extra three or four, they will have to be covered by the employment protection legislation, so perhaps he will decide not to take them on. The Government are introducing a new artificial barrier by this proposal.<br><br>
The major issue is the loss of rights and whether employees will be anxious to be employed by small employers if they do not have the kind of rights that they get elsewhere in industry. It gives small industry a bad name. That is perhaps why the Institute of Personnel Management, whose members are the kind of people who are, or ought to be, supporting the Government, says about clause 7:
<br><blockquote><p>"The denial of basic rights and protection for any employed person because of the size of his or her employer is another matter, and the Institute hopes that the Government will amend this section of the Bill."</p></blockquote>
They are trying to amend it, but they have made the situation worse.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 940</span>
This affects a great many people, and the Low Pay Unit makes this clear. We are talking about 4 million. It is no academic matter. It is interesting that the Low Pay Unit shows that firms employing fewer than 20 account for nearly a quarter of all unfair dismissal cases in tribunals. This is what it says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Research conducted by the Industrial Relations Research Unit at Warwick highlighted the fact that only just over half of firms employing less than 20 claimed to have any discipline/dismissal procedure. As the incidence of procedures appears to have a marked effect on the outcome of unfair dismissal cases perhaps this is where attention should be directed, rather than changes in employees qualification period. On past form, it seems unlikely that the majority of small firms will be aware of, or understand, the amended law. In fact there are real dangers of misunderstandings leading to more problems for the small firm proprietor."</p></blockquote>
That is what the Low Pay Unit, with a great deal of experience in this field, thinks.<br><br>
Our amendments are designed either to get rid of the clause or make better sense of it. That is the reason for amendments Nos. 105 and 106. Amendment No. 105 inserts "one year" and not "two years"; amendment No. 106 says "leave out 'nineteen'"—that will now be different—"and insert 'five'".<br><br>
We are trying to make the best of a bad job. We are against the principle of the clause because we are against exclusion of rights on unfair dismissal. We stand for the extension of rights, not the diminution of rights which the Government seem to stand for.</span></p>
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Goodhew. I wish to repeat my request. May I point out to the Under-Secretary the appalling difficulties in which he is placing not only the Opposition but the Chair itself? You will recall that my hon. Friend the Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Radice) said that he thought he was directing his remarks to what the Secretary of State had said on Tuesday night. My hon. Friend has not got the faintest idea what the Secretary of State said. You, Mr. Goodhew, were not present and are not able to read what was said.<br><br>
I wonder whether the Under-Secretary appreciates that that will mean that any one of us can get up and, without going completely crazy, talk about almost anything because that will be his belief of what the Secretary of State said on Tuesday
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1007">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 941</span>
night. Could I, therefore, appeal again to the Under-Secretary to tell us what on earth the Government amendment is supposed to mean? Only in that way will it be possible for the Committee to proceed in an orderly manner.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State of Employment (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Goodhew. I recognise that the Committee is unavoidably placed in some difficulty, and I regret that the <i>Official Report</i> is not available. But I remind the Committee that we have placed upon the table an explanatory note relating to these amendments Nos. 129 to 131.<br><br>
I do not accept what was said, with less than his usual charity, by the hon. Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Radice) about the speech made by my right hon. Friend on Tuesday. It set out in a painstaking and thorough way—and, I thought, in a clear way—the effect of these amendments. Had it been followed with the advantage of the <i>Official Report,</i> it would have been doubly clear. May I remind the hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans), who, I know, does his very best to follow our proceedings and contributes valuably to them, that the note sets out in a clear way what the effect of each of these amendments is, so I believe that the difficulties are overcome.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could answer the point of order. The Chair has no power to instruct hon. Members to speak. It is a good thing that it does not. That would be most unacceptable to everyone. As for the scope of the debate, that is controlled by the amendments which are being discussed and not by what may have been said earlier in the debate on this group.<br><br>
I am afraid that I cannot help the hon. Gentleman except to join in his hope that we shall have the <i>Official Report</i> before we come to the end of this morning's sitting, so that those who cannot remember what the Secretary of State said will be able to refresh their memories.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Goodhew. Could I make quite clear, to get the record straight, that it is not a question of not remembering what the Secretary of State said. If that were so, the problem would be mine entirely. Our difficulty was in understand-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 942</span>
ing what the Secretary of State said. With the greatest respect to the Under-Secretary he will recall, if he was listening in his usual assiduous fashion to his right hon. Friend, that the Secretary of State wandered all over the place and introduced matter which is not in the advice notes which have been put out. That was my point.<br><br>
I fully respect the advice that the Chair has given us. I recognise that the Chair would like the hon. and learned Gentleman to get to his feet, but, if he refuses, I accept that there is nothing that you can do, Mr. Goodhew.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for his understanding. I assure him that I feel as deeply as he does about it. But one thing that the Chair is not responsible for is whether any hon. Member's speech is understood by other hon. Members. The Chair has sufficient responsibilities without that. Perhaps we can now get on with the debate and hope that some light will come upon the scene.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a genuinely brief contribution in support of this amendment. I am sorry that my right hon. Friend is not here to hear me thank him for introducing it to the Committee.<br><br>
In our previous deliberations on clause 5, when we dealt with the determination of unfair dismissals, both sides of the Committee batted surveys like a ping-pong ball backwards and forwards to prove that their policy was a little bit whiter than white. I shall mention three surveys. Hon. Members will see that the results of all three are pretty wide. That is a reflection of the fact that the survey results depend on the type of questions asked.<br><br>
I refer first to the survey that has already come up, the ORC survey commissioned by the Department of Employment in 1978. This was carried out with 304 firms employing under 50 people, and it produced the figure, depending on how one looked at the questions, that anything from 2 per cent. to 24 per cent. of the firms interviewed were of the opinion that the Employment Protection Act had a varying effect on employers as a deterrent to employment. One of the criticisms of that survey can be levelled at the Department, because it did not ask what was a major deterrent on taking on additional staff. I believe that a survey commissioned by the Department of Employment should have been specific on that.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1008">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 943</span>
The next survey referred to is that of the Small Businesses Bureau, which at the same time commissioned its survey over 804 firms. I fully accept that the questions put were loaded, so I hope that hon. Gentlemen—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Small Businesses Bureau is an integral part of the Conservative Party, run from Conservative Central Office. People must know that before they judge what credibility to attach to the value of that survey.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is nice of the right hon. Gentleman to tell the Committee that, since I was about to say that it is the child of Central Office. I must, however, assure the right hon. Gentleman that it is showing signs of considerable independence of thought and mind, which I hope will be encouraged over the years. I admit that the questions in that survey were far more loaded. It came up with the figure that over 40 per cent. felt that sections of the Employment Protection Act were major deterrents to more jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that the Small Businesses Bureau did not ask for small firms to be excluded from the provisions on unfair dismissal? It asked that the dismissal procedures should apply to all firms and should be brought down from two years to one. It did not ask for small firms to be excluded from the unfair dismissal procedures, as the Government are proposing to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understood it, the survey carried out in 1978 was to ask small firms how significant the law was to their businesses in terms of jobs then and their plans for the next couple of years, and was not on definite provisions and specifications, as suggested by the hon. Gentleman. But it seems that he just wanted to put something on the record and is not interested in the answer.<br><br>
The last survey I mention is that of the Birmingham chamber of industry and commerce, which attempted in December 1977—and I think that it was very noble to try—to quantify the number of job opportunities that have been lost through the Act. It has come up with a figure of 2.4 job opportunities lost per 100 employees in companies employing up to 200 people.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 944</span>
I fully accept that there is a considerable divergence of results, but we can see through it all that there is an underlying thread that the Employment Protection Act has a deterrent effect to providing some form of job opportunity.<br><br>
I hope that on both sides of the Committee there will not be any disagreement on the importance of the smaller business sector to our community in providing employment and creating the wealth of this country.<br><br>
Without wishing to eulogise over the smaller business sector and go into detail about all the things in favour of it, such as independence and so on, I ask the Committee to bear in mind that 25 per cent. of the gross national product comes from this sector of our community, though that is less, unfortunately, than that produced in Japan and Germany—countries whose industry and commercial prowess, I suggest, we should do well to emulate.<br><br>
Going back to the surveys, if we accept the slenderest of threads that run through them all, that is, the 2 per cent., we find that in this country some 16,500 firms feel that they have been affected by the legislation. If we take the higher percentages, the figure is in hundreds of thousands.<br><br>
I thank my right hon. Friend—he is not here this morning—for drawing the Committee's attention to the fact that other countries give the smaller business sector—this very small small business sector—extra advantages to try to encourage it to produce more jobs and more wealth. There is a great advantage also in trying to get the redundancy qualifications and legislation tied in with those on the unfair dismissal aspects as here.<br><br>
I am concerned about the provision for written information prior to engagement. It is vital that we make sure that every employee is aware of his rights before taking on any employment in this smaller small business sector.<br><br>
The difficulty with this sector is that employers have to deal with an avalanche of paper and guff—coming out of this place, mainly—and they just do not have the management or the staff to deal with it. I am glad to hear that the Department of Employment is to make a special effort to see that employees are well aware of their rights, and I hope that the Department regards this not as a one-off operation to get this provision launched but that it will be a continuing effort so that people

starting work in this sector know what they are going in for and where they stand.<br><br>
But we must look at this amendment in the light of sheer practicality. I know—I will lay money on it—that there will be claims that we are creating a "second-class citizen", but I say to the Opposition that there is nothing so second-class as a man or a woman without a job. I sincerely hope that this amendment helps to create jobs. I hope that it gives support to the smaller business sector, because I believe that that is where the future and the strength of this country will lie. I warmly commend the amendment to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite as concerned as my hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) about not having the <i>Official Report</i> here. I think that I can remember relatively well the line of argument that the Secretary of State took, or at least the bits of it that I want to remember. Moreover, I suspect that even if we had the record in front of us we should not get much more enlightenment. So far as I can remember the arguments that he developed—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Radice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The fact was, I think, that the right hon. Gentleman did not really put any argument for what he was saying. He just stated what the changes were to be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right. I am sorry the Secretary of State is not with us this morning. One understands why he cannot be here. Whereas he would here be defending his majority position on the Committee, he is in the Cabinet defending his usual minority position, and I am sure that that is more important. But, in so far as he has been described as a Cabinet "wet," I thought that the arguments which he deployed on Tuesday were about the wettest I have heard on any amendment to the Bill. They dissolved as he went along.<br><br>
Although we recognise that the Government amendment widens the scope of the clause and we are not now talking just about new small firms, the new small firms aspect is till there. When he was challenged to present any evidence on that—I shall come to the point that the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South-West (Mr. Page) raised about the wider aspects in a moment—he had none whatsoever to offer. He mumbled something about statistical evidence. He certainly had none
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 946</span>
to offer. The only thing he subsequently did was to refer to the Massachusetts study.<br><br>
It is all right to make a passing reference, but he should have told us something of what that study dealt with. I do not want to weary the Committee this morning with details of surveys, but I do not believe that the results of that survey bear out the arguments used by the Secretary of State. If the Committee wishes to debate that in more detail, I have some facts and figures in my file, but I do not particularly want to go up that road because I do not think that it is relevant to what we are discussing.<br><br>
11 a.m.<br><br>
The Government amendment extends the clause for new employees to cover all firms employing fewer than 20 workers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Twenty or less.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, 20 or less. As my hon. Friend the Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Radice) said, the Low Pay Unit's estimate is that that means that about 4 million workers will probably now be without the relevant protection. That is a great many. It is certainly borne out by a survey carried out in my own area of Islington several years ago. It was done in 1971–72, but I do not think that the situation has altered. It showed that 85 per cent, of firms in my area had fewer than 20 workers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not take this to mean that people who are already in small firms will lose their particular level of protection. They will not. It refers only to new employees coming in. So although the hon. Gentleman is globally right on his 4 million, he should take those who will go into small businesses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that it is difficult to bandy figures about, such as 4 million, but there is also a very high labour turnover in small firms. I am sure that if we took the end of a two-year period, we should probably find that the figure was not far out.<br><br>
The high wastage or high labour turnover in the whole small firm sector must be taken into account.<br><br>
I come now to some of the evidence which I think is overwhelmingly against the Government's case. I shall quote briefly from the TUC's evidence. I should
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1010">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 947</span>
not have troubled to do that were it not for the fact that the hon. and learned Gentleman made some use of the TUC when it suited his purpose, and I do not think it unreasonable for me to refer to it in the context of what it has said about clause 7:
<br><blockquote><p>"The intention to establish a caste of workers without any unfair dismissal rights (that is, those who work for newly established employers with less than 20 employees)"—</p></blockquote>
we know that that has now been changed, but the point still stands—
<br><blockquote><p>"is unjust and totally contrary to the original principles of the employment protection legislation, that is, to provide minimum rights for all workers, and to encourage backward employers (often small employers) to adopt higher standards."</p></blockquote>
If the Government are unhappy with the TUC's view, it is worth referring them to the Confederation of British Industry. I should not have thought that view of the Confederation of British Industry would be so lightly dismissed by the Government, yet its view on clause 7—the clause as it originally stood, but I do not think that that alters the argument—is as follows:
<br><blockquote><p>"However, we have misgivings about the desirability of exempting small firms from the requirements of the legislation during their first two years of trading. There would be difficulties of definition in framing the legislation"—</p></blockquote>
We have certainly seen the difficulties of definition. Indeed, the Government have had to rush in with these late amendments because of the difficulties of definition and because, frankly, they did not get it right to start with. The CBI continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"There would be difficulties of definition in framing the legislation, which would need to be complex to avoid abuse, and in the case of newly established firms the CBI is aware that, quite deliberately, many last only for a short time, and that accordingly employees might be in need of greater protection rather than less."</p></blockquote>
It is only fair for me to continue. The CBI goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"On the other hand, some smaller firms believe that the proposed measure would remove the disincentive to recruitment constituted by the current provisions. On balance, we take the view that the exemption now provided from liability for unfair dismissal of employees on the first twelve months of their employment should be sufficient, and that a special exemption for new small firms is unnecessary."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Chester-le-Street referred to the view of the Institute of Personnel Management. I wish to refer to it in a little more detail because it makes some important points. I quote again from its response to the original consultative documents:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 948</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"The Institute, while in sympathy with the intention to assist the small employer, is opposed to the proposal to exempt new and small firms from the provisions covering unfair dismissal for their first two years of trading on the grounds of both principle and practical application."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South-West talked about the practical application of all this. That is the view of the Institute of Personnel Management, which comprises practitioners in the field, people who deal with these problems daily and have great experience of the difficulties that arise. It goes on:
<br><blockquote><p>"The extension of the minimum qualifying service from 6 months to 12 months (from 1 October 1979) together with the proposed amendment to Section 57(4)(i) above"</p></blockquote>
it refers to the Bill—
<br><blockquote><p>"should give the new and small firm improved and reasonable safeguards. The principle of a common standard for treatment of all employees, to which even the smallest company must adhere, is fundamental.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"In addition, the practical complications of defining a 'new' company and determining who would be covered by the 2-year 'umbrella' might lead to a number of undesirable side-effects, such as: an increase in the number of hearings on tribunal jurisdiction; artificial creation of new small companies; use of agency staff to keep numbers down; discouragement of recruiting when numbers approach 20; different conditions for employees working alongside each other in industries where small subcontractors operate."</p></blockquote>
One then turns to the British Institute of Management. Here we get a bit of support for the Government, but a significant minority—it was a close vote in the survey it took—was against the Government's proposals in the clause.<br><br>
I wish also to refer to the Warwick university survey. My hon. Friend has just referred to it, but it is right to place on record the evidence there is about these proposals. The Warwick university survey has been referred to on a number of occasions, but I do not think that anyone has questioned its independence. It reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"The proposal to exempt new small firms again appears to be based on the mistaken assumption that the employment protection legislation is inhibiting recruitment. This proposal, if enacted, will put even more employees outside the protection of the law. But it raises other problems. It is proposed that 'employers would be under an obligation to give employees, before recruitment, a written notification of their rights in regard to unfair dismissal', by which is meant that prospective workers should be told that if they accept employment their right to complain of unfair dismissal is restricted."</p></blockquote>
This, of course, would apply to the wider clause, as amended.
<br><blockquote><p>"What would happen should this obligation not be carried out? Would an uninformed employee
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1011">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 949</span>
be able to bring a case after the one-year qualification period; would he be debarred but compensated for the failure to notify? While it would be unjustifiable for prospective employees not to be so warned, there is a risk that the burden on new small employers in terms of having to comply with procedural requirements or prove their exempted status might be increased by such a measure."</p></blockquote>
That is a point to which the hon. and learned Gentleman will perhaps refer when he responds. It goes on:
<br><blockquote><p>"Further, as their employees will be entitled to the same protection as everyone else after the first two years of trading, the obligation to maintain records and develop procedures will still be there—unless, of course, the effect is to encourage ephemeral businesses."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I have that clear?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could pass the hon. and learned Gentleman the paper. I appreciate that I went rather quickly.<br><br>
There are one or two other references I should like to make in terms of evidence against the Government's case in particular. The Association of County Councils, to which we referred on clause 5—that worthy Conservative-dominated body—has set out its opposition to the clause, and I am sure that it would maintain that opposition despite the Government's amendment. The same goes for the Royal College of Nursing, which also has set out its opposition to the clause.<br><br>
I come back to the wider issue of the surveys that have been presented. I shall not go into the Small Businesses Bureau survey because that was a particularly prejudiced piece of research. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster pointed out, it is the product of Conservative Central Office. It is difficult to regard that as impartial and independent. But, going back to the ORC survey of small firms, I recall what the hon. and learned Gentleman said when he was referring to it. Again, I shall not go into detail, because my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster gave him what might be described as the facts and figures when we were debating clause 5. One could almost say that he threw him the facts and figures.<br><br>
When I interrupted the hon. and learned Gentleman and pointed out that certain figures that he used were the result of prompted questions, he said, "Oh, prompted", and dismissed it as though it were an improper thing for me to say. The word I used was the word used in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 950</span>
survey itself, as he well appreciates. It was only when the questions in that survey were loaded that they came up with the kind of answers of which the Government, groping, I think, for assistance in this area, were able to make some limited use.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman not distinguish between a loaded question and a prompted question? A loaded question is phrased in such a way as to get a particular answer. A prompted question asks the question openly and evenly but directs a person to think in a particular area. This was a Government survey, conducted by the Department of Employment. It was not a loaded question; it was a prompted question to elicit a particular piece of information, which it did most successfully.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One can choose one's adjectives as one wishes. I am not complaining about the fact that it was prompted or loaded, according to which adjective one uses. All I am saying is that that was the situation. It was not until that particular question was asked that the results came out in the form that would be of any assistance whatsoever to the Government in their case.<br><br>
The clause, either amended or un-amended, is thoroughly unsatisfactory. I have referred to the CBI, the Institute of Personnel Management, the Royal College of Nursing, the TUC and various other bodies. There is no evidence, particularly on the subject of new small firms, of the need for this change.<br><br>
What is being said on the wider issue of small firms generally is that this is of some benefit to some small firms. But what the Government have consistently ignored throughout are the rights of the individual workers concerned. They are concerned, as it were, to protect the employer or assist the employer.<br><br>
All right, perhaps here and there at the margin that may arise. One may accept it, as the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South-West suggested, at the bottom end of the survey. But that the Secretary of State has said is not so much that he accepts that these people are correct but that they believe that they are correct. That has tended to be his argument. But even if one accepts that, one has to offset against it the deprivation of many people—we have had an estimate of 4 million, but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1012">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 951</span>
whether that is accurate is impossible to say—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is presenting a powerful case for the withdrawal of the entire clause. Will he spend a moment or two in addressing himself to an entirely new aspect that can flow from clause 7? He will be aware that there is not a great deal of trade union organisation among a great number of small firms, but when about 4 million people are likely to be deprived of rights which are granted to everyone else there is a powerful incentive to them to join a union so that the trade union can negotiate voluntary agreements in line with the provisions for the rest of the population. Indeed, clause 7 may well be a fillip to trade union organisation rather than the hindrance which the Bill intends.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that it is in the small firms sector in particular that trade union organisation and protection for workers is at a minimum. Should the Bill go on to the statute book, I hope that it will have the effect that my hon. Friend has suggested and that it will be a fillip. But one has to recognise, too, that throughout the small firms sector it is exceedingly difficult for trade unions to organise, mainly because we are talking about people in very small pockets of industry and commerce.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
It is difficult for unions to organise the employees of small firms in terms of economy of scale—the resources that they can bring to bear. It is a costly business, clearly, to service people in that sort of area as opposed to, shall we say, in a factory where all the members are under one roof. So there are real and genuine difficulties for the trade unions.<br><br>
There is also the problem of high turnover, which I have already mentioned: even when one recruits, one has to go on running faster to stay on the same spot in order to take care of the turnover. Therefore, whilst there may be something of a fillip to trade union recruitment—there certainly ought to be—I should not like to set too much store by that because of the difficulties that I have described.<br><br>
I come back to my point about the weight of the evidence. The hon. and learned Gentleman has been very concerned with the weight of evidence on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 952</span>
other issues. I have not done a percentage poll on the issue of new firms, but I think it would go well beyond the 80 per cent. he talks about for ballots in other circumstances. The weight of the evidence is overwhelmingly against the Government on the clause. The advice that they are receiving from all quarters, not just from trade unions, not just from members of this side of the Committee, but from other bodies such as the CBI and the Institute of Personnel Management, which certainly have no vested interest in protecting the rights of employees over and above the rights of employers, is that they should come off it, and that is precisely what the Government should do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for forestalling contributions from Opposition Members, but I recognise that the Committee may be in some difficulty. However, much more so, the Chair may be in some difficulty, having regard to what you have said, Mr. Goodhew, in view of the fact that you were not present when the speech was made by my right hon. Friend and we do not yet have the <i>Official Report.</i> It might be for the convenience of the Committee if I sought briefly to summarise the effect of the speech and to set out, perhaps with a little more flesh on than the bare note has, what the effects of the clause are and to deal with the points that have been raised so far. I shall try to do so as quickly as possible, and I hope I shall not be thought to be dealing with it disrespectfully or cursorily. We must try to save as much time as we can.<br><br>
First, let me put the original terms of the clause in the context of the proposals published by the Government as a working paper in September. We then proposed
<br><blockquote><p>"to exempt new firms with less than 20 employees from the unfair dismissal provisions for the first 2 years of trading".</p></blockquote>
I pause there to say that that was slap in line with what was said in our manifesto, that we would change those aspects of the employment protection legislation which were seen to be working against the interests of employment.<br><br>
We went on in that paper to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"During this period employees would still accumulate service towards the qualifying period for unfair dismissal complaints, but they would be able to exercise their rights only after the first 2 years of the firm's life."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1013">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 953</span>
"Of the firm's life"—that is the Bill as drafted.
<br><blockquote><p>"Employers would be under an obligation to give employees, before recruitment, a written notification of their rights in regard to unfair dismissal."</p></blockquote>
All that is what we set forth as our proposal in September, and that proposal became incorporated in clause 7(1) of the Bill, with one slight alteration: the period of exemption in the clause starts from the day on which the first employee is employed. This was thought to be an easier date to determine than the point at which an undertaking started trading.<br><br>
In the discussion of the contents of the working paper and in the discussion of the Bill, the Government decided that the two-year exemption for new small firms ought to be extended to cover new employees of all small firms, small firms being defined as having fewer than 20 employees. In subsequent discussions, the Government agreed to amend the cut-off point so that it referred to firms where the number of employees did not exceed 20, as it was thought that this would prove easier to explain to small employers. That was the point which was made very plain by my right hon. Friend at our last sitting. If one says not more than 20, that sticks a bit more easily in people's minds than if one uses 19 as the base point.<br><br>
Now I come to the amendments which we are debating, and they carry forward two major elements of the original clause in the printed Bill.<br><br>
First, there is the requirement that employers should notify employees, in writing, on engagement of the effect of the provision; that is carried forward. This is an important point though not one without controversy. On balance, the Government believe that it is right that somebody has to wait two years, rather than one year, before he qualifies to be able to complain that he has been unfairly dismissed should be notified at the time he is taken on, so that there are no misunderstandings. This is controversial, and we have been pressed strongly that this would be a further administrative burden, or, indeed, stumbling block. I was asked by the Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant), taking up a point raised by the Warwick university unit, what effect there would be if this provision were not complied with. The answer is that if it were not complied with and if notice were not given at the time
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 954</span>
of engagement, the protection of the clause would be lost by the employer. So it is controversial, but that is the answer to that question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Flowing from that comes the point about the additional bureaucracy involved, which perhaps the hon. and learned Member would also deal with, because his party reminds us constantly that it should happen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have to concede that, and that is why this point has given us great concern. As the hon. Gentleman rightly points out, our theme is that new employment can, most hopefully, be looked for from the small business sector. Our theme is that the employment protection legislation acts as a block on that generation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be rubbish in the hon. Gentleman's view, but that is our theme. He cannot say otherwise, because I thought I had rather been labouring it. Therefore, the hon. Member for Islington, Central is perfectly right when he says that surely this pulls in the opposite direction, that it is another administrative chore. That is why it has worried us, but on balance we have thought it right that a worker who will be in a less favourable position than his neighbour working for a larger firm ought to be told so at the start. So the amendment carries forward that important provision from the existing clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Notwithstanding what my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) said about additional bureaucracy, seeing that the employer has to give this information on engagement, about the requirements of the amendment, why have the Government chosen to drop the obligation on the employer to inform the new employee when the period will expire? It seems to me that whilst he is doing the one, he can do the other at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We want to keep these matters as simple as possible, and our belief is that if the employer has to give notice to the employee that he will have to wait for two years before he can qualify for a claim for compensation for unfair
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1014">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 955</span>
dismissal, it is not too difficult to work out at that time what two years hence will be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why was it not in the original Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not believe that the original Bill is perfection, and we think that there are probably grounds in certain respects for improvement. We think it is right to put it this way to keep it as simple as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cyril Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to follow the clause and what the Minister is saying. Are we to have a situation where employees of the same company have different rules applying to them? If that is proposed, as an employer of labour I can tell the Minister that it really is cuckoo. One cannot run a business on the basis of one set of employees having certain conditions and another set having another. It is even worse in companies employing fewer than 20 than it would be in companies employing 200, as everybody knows what everybody else is doing. If two employees are being dismissed for the same thing and one has some rights and one has not, what kind of a situation is that? It really is cuckoo and I urge the Minister to think again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause as amended will relate to new employees. It is clearly right that one cannot take away rights already acquired. We are talking about a company which employs no more than 20 people and wishes to recruit a new employee. The new employee in those circumstances will have to wait for two years before he acquires the right to complain.<br><br>
This is a clause which we are strongly pressed to introduce in the interests of employment, further employment and maintained employment by the small companies. If it is right that somebody should be given notice at the outset, it is quite plain that it cannot apply to employees already on the payroll. The point is that a new employee ought to be given notice that he will be in a less favourable position, and in those circumstances it must follow that the provisions of this clause can apply only to people who are taken into employment after the Act comes into effect or this clause commences, whichever is the relevant date.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not true that for a small businessman such as the hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 956</span>
Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith), even now there are employees who are differently placed before the law? There is the employee who has been there for less than a year and the employee who has been there for more than a year. If two employees with different lengths of service are dismissed for the same offence, one will have right of appeal and the other will not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is perfectly right. It really depends on whether one thinks there ought to be any distinction between those who have served a short time and those who have served longer than whatever qualifying period one fixes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to help the Committee, and I intervened at this stage in order to explain the new clause. I will give way to the hon. Gentleman, but I must be allowed after that to continue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman. I have only one small point. I was intrigued by the Under-Secretary's comment just now that it would be wrong to take away rights which had already been acquired. Is it not a fact that the whole of the Bill is taking away rights that have already been acquired?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that is right. I am talking about the right to claim for unfair dismissal which one has already acquired in relation to a qualifying period of service. If one has acquired a right, I should have thought that it was common ground in this Committee that it was undesirable to say that the rules had now changed and somebody has had it. That is why we are saying that in the case of new employees, and only new employees, this provision shall apply.<br><br>
I now wish to state the next important provision that is carried forward: the provision in the relevant section of the main Act which is not amended, that the extended qualifying period does not apply to dismissals on grounds of trade union membership or activities, for which there is no qualifying period, and dismissals on certain medical grounds under the statutes which are listed in elsewhere in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1015">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 957</span>
the 1976 Act, for which there is a qualifying period of four weeks. That is quite unchanged.<br><br>
Now I come to the changes in the original clause which are affected by the amendment. First, the exemption from unfair dismissal for new firms with fewer than 20 employees for the first two years after they take on their first employee is replaced with a two-year qualifying period for unfair dismissal for new employees of all small firms. Secondly, the limit on the size of firm is raised from "does not exceed 19" to "does not exceed 20". Thirdly, the employees to be taken into account when assessing an employer's eligibility will be
<br><blockquote><p>"the number of employees employed by the employer … added to the number employed by any associated employer"</p></blockquote>
rather than, according to the origrnal clause,
<br><blockquote><p>"the number of employees employed in the undertaking…".</p></blockquote>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
If I may fasten on the last point, there was a certain amount of criticism about "undertaking" and whether that was sufficiently accurately expressed. In relation to the point made by the Institute of Personnel Management, to which the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) referred, those objections were concerned largely with the difficulties of defining "new undertaking", and it is partly because of these difficulties that the Government have introduced their amendment which refers to "employer" and "associated employers". The idea of aggregating the employees of the employer and associated employers follows the same line as clause 11 which deals with the small firms' maternity reinstatement exemption. This ought to be more precise an undertaking, because it is a concept with which tribunals are more familiar and which, in the case of companies, is already defined in section 153(4) of the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1948:
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purpose of this Act, any two employers are to be treated as associated if one is a company of which the other (directly or indirectly) has control; or if both are companies of which a third person (directly or indirectly) has control; and the expression ' associated employer ' shall be construed accordingly."</p></blockquote>

The section of the 1978 Act which said that the exemption would apply only for firms taking on their first employees after the Act came into force is deleted. The amended clause will be subject to the commencement provisions for the rest of the Bill in clause 18 which contains its own transitional provisions. It will not affect employees already in employment.<br><br>
Amendment No. 131 is a technical amendment. It ensures that for the sake of this provision, if an employee is dismissed with less than his statutory notice, his continuous employment is taken to continue until the date on which his statutory notice would have expired.<br><br>
In relation to the new qualifying period, the original clause which referred to two years after the undertaking took on its first employee would have applied to all employees regardless of when they were engaged within the two-year period. For example, an employee recruited six months after the first employee would have had to serve 18 months before being able to complain of unfair dismissal.<br><br>
The clause as amended gives each new employee a two-year qualifying period starting from the date on which he joins his employer if at no time during that period the number of employees to be taken into account exceeds 20.<br><br>
The two-year qualifying period will apply to employers with no more than 20 employees throughout the period of employment of the dismissed worker. This formulation was chosen as being the most satisfactory out of several possibilities. This bears in part upon the point raised by the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith). It avoids fluctuations in the rights of individual employees while allowing a firm which falls back to 20 employees to qualify in respect of employees taken on thereafter. It would not require tribunals to look at the size of the firm over the whole of its history.<br><br>
I have intervened in order to explain the effect of the provisions. As I am on my feet, may I deal with some of the issues raised so far in the debate? The hon. Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Radice) asked what was the maximum. The maximum, as I have expressed it, is that at no time did the firm's employees exceed 20, taking into account also those employed by an associated employer.<br><br>
Then I was asked about the Low Pay Unit's observations. The hon. Member for Chester-le-Street said that four million
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1016">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 959</span>
workers were employed in small firms. But it is not correct to imply that all these are at risk. I understand that only 5 per cent. of applicants—about 1,500 out of 43,000—every year have put in from one or two years' service in small firms when they complain of unfair dismissal and earn less than the average wage.<br><br>
What we are talking about is those who are within the period of 12 months to 24 months. It is only that which is added to the qualifying period by the clause. It is therefore wrong to say "Look here, there are four million people working in small firms." What one has to look at, in order to assess the size of the group that will be affected by the subsection, is those who are working at a period of between 12 and 24 months.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is the Government's estimate of that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said, about 5 per cent.—1,500—have between one and two years' service in small firms and earn less than the average wage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That does not give any indication of the numbers involved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, but what we are talking about is those who have complained of unfair dismissal. One can only assess the statistical effect or the likely effect of any provision by looking at the records over the years—[<i>Interruption.</i>] I thought the complaint was that we were not paying attention to the evidence. This seems to me to be much the best evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Radice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman is quoting the evidence on unfair dismissal, and he is trying to show that it is a very small problem. But on all the other evidence he has been trying to show that it is a very big problem. That does not square with his argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not trying to show that it is a small problem or a big problem. I am simply trying to show what the number of cases, going on past records, is likely to be. I do not say that this is unimportant. If it were, we should not be going through all these hoops. We think it important. One should never dismiss any provision lightly that puts
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 960</span>
into a separate and less favoured category a class of worker or any other person who has benefited compared with the benefits that are awarded generally.<br><br>
I have never sought to suggest that the arguments here are all one way. They are not. But Governments have to strike a balance. That is their job and, if they do not like it, they pay the penalty. But the prospect of a penalty is no excuse for doing nothing. That is why we set out these proposals in our manifesto and in the working paper, and now incorporate them—improved, as we believe them to be, by this amendment—in the Bill.<br><br>
The CBI was relied upon very heavily by the hon. Member for Islington, Central. It is true that it has expressed the reservations of which he reminded the Committee. I said the last time we discussed these matters that the surveys were a bran tub. Many of the representations that have been made represent, taken corporately, a bran tub. One dips in and there is something for everybody. The main body of the CBI has been accurately quoted, but I must remind the hon. Gentleman of what the CBI Smaller Firms Council said to us, because it is about the smaller firms that we are primarily concerned:
<br><blockquote><p>"In view of smaller firms' lack of specialised personnel departments and formalised assessment procedures, and of the generally wider range of capabilities required of employees in such firms, they feel that a two-year period would be desirable."</p></blockquote>
So the Smaller Firms Council of the CBI supports the clause. One has simply to make one's judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman said that he had been pressed to make these changes. I take it that the CBI Smaller Firms Council, which he has just quoted, is referring to the wider issue and not to new small firms. What I really asked him was where the evidence was on new small firms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One cannot readily have a survey of people who have not started new businesses. It would have defied the hon. Gentleman even in his period of office to have held a survey of people who did not start businesses. That does not mean to say that one cannot formulate an opinion about the effect of certain legislation and what the effect of amending it would be. We are not so
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1017">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 961</span>
bound by statistics, I hope, that without statistics of what may seem to be pretty clear common sense, in circumstances where it would be impossible to get any statistics, we are incapable of taking action. It is the views of people such as the CBI's Smaller Firms Council and the regard we have had to such surveys as exist relating to the effect of the Acts generally which lead us to conclude that a significant number of people are deterred. I do not say that it is the majority. It may be; it may not be. I quite accept the points which the right hon. Gentleman made about the ORC survey, but one cannot conceivably say that the result of that survey shows that a majority of the respondents were deterred.<br><br>
However, taking the figures upon which he most relied, a significant number were deterred, and we do not believe that we can afford, as a Government faced with recession, to shut the door on any amendment or reform that will offer reasonable prospects of increasing the numbers of jobs, provided that, by so doing, we do not go against the idea of job protection.<br><br>
We have been strongly pressed to take all small firms right out of the unfair dismissal provisions. If the Opposition think that it is all a bed of roses doing this job, I can assure them that is not the case at all. I hope that it is a convincing answer to those who are so misguided as to say that we are the tools of the CBI when I say that we are not going down the road that we are asked to go in every respect by the CBI. One has to strike a fair balance, and that is what we have tried to do.<br><br>
I have taken some time, but I wished to assist the Chair in particular, and I thought I would take the opportunity also of trying to answer the points raised in the debate so far. I hope I may be excused from answering further, unless new points arise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the principle that one should give at least a consolation prize to a good trier, even if he has not won, I thank the hon. and learned Gentleman for the contribution which he has just made.

having attempted at least to put some filling in the yawning gap which was left by the extraordinary performance last Tuesday afternoon of the Secretary of State. Far from putting the case clearly, as the hon. and learned Gentleman said, the right hon. Gentleman did nothing more than gabble through a brief, which he manifestly was not even trying to understand, with a mien and in a tone of voice which indicated that he was extremely bored with the whole proceedings and resented having had this chore foisted upon him to divert him from the much weightier and difficult considerations with which his life is beset at the present time.<br><br>
We know a little more about the Government's proposals as a result of the hon. and learned Gentlemen intervention, and I thank him for it. I had not intended to intervene in this debate at all and was led to do so only by the speech of the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South-West (Mr. Page). I am sorry to be speaking while he has nipped out for his coffee; I shall be nipping out for mine as soon as I have finished.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to inform my hon. Friend that he will not be nipping out to get coffee in the corridor. We are deprived of that pleasure this morning because of some industrial dispute.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps I might inform the Committee that news has just reached the Chair that that dispute has been settled. There is coffee.</span></p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are indebted to you for that news, Mr. Goodhew.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South-West began his observations by saying that he thought it common ground between the two sides of the Committee that we attached importance and value to the small firms sector. He must have missed some of our earlier debates, because we have been over that ground more than once and it was agreed that that is common ground between us. We have all paid tribute to it. Some do a bit more than talk about it. They spend time and energy doing some work in it.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman exaggerated a little when he said words to the effect
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1018">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 963</span>
that the small firms sector will be the salvation of this country. That is going too far. It indicates a view of the situation which, because it is exaggerated, will not help us to get our policies right with regard to small firms. But we are agreed that they are very important and that we should do something to get over their difficulties.<br><br>
But we have also agreed in the past that it is not the Employment Protection Act which is their major difficulty. I invite the Government, as they seem so keen about these surveys—I shall say something about surveys shortly—to go round the small firms sector asking "Which is the greater burden to you and lessens your power to employ people—the Employment Protection Act or an interest rate of 18 per cent?" I invite them to ask a second question: "Which is the greater difficulty you face in your business and which most lessens your opportunity of employing more people—the Employment Protection Act or the shrinkage of the home market which has been created by the Government's deflationary policies?"</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not hear the Secretary of State for Industry on the radio last night, and I doubt if my hon. Friend did, but I am told that in a discussion with an interviewer on small businesses and their problems he mentioned planning and financial aspects such as taxation, but he made virtually no reference to employment protection legislation, which I should have thought was not insignificant, knowing the general views of the Secretary of State for Industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is certainly the case. We have made the point over and over again that it is not the EPA but the actions taken by the Government in their economic strategy which put the biggest burden on small firms.<br><br>
I have a little smile to myself when I hear hon. Gentlemen telling us that there was a survey of small employers to ask them whether they would rather be without this, that or the other restraint put upon them in industrial relations. I do not think it matters whether the survey is a genuine one, like some that we have talked about, or a phoney one like the one carried out by a front organisation for Conservative
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 964</span>
Central Office. If one has an answer from a percentage of small business men—or, for that matter, any other business men—of "Yes" to the question: "Would you sooner be without some of the obligations which the law places upon you?", big deal, surprise, surprise. What else would one expect?<br><br>
I am amazed that the percentages are not much higher. I should not have been at all surprised if 100 per cent. had gone one way. Asking an employer, small or large, whether he would sooner be without some of the restraints put upon him by the law will provide the same answer as would a survey among a group of housebreakers and burglars about whether they would sooner be without the restraints of the law and the attentions of the police.<br><br>
I am not saying that employers are breakers of the law. Everyone likes to be free of restraint. If one went to employers and asked "Would you be in favour, notwithstanding the parking regulations in the area where your premises are, of your having a right to park in front of your premises?" one would get a large percentage of "Yes" responses. Surprise, surprise. Big deal!<br><br>
What the surveys have done is equivalent to going round among a group of young ladies and asking "Would you prefer to be a beautiful or an ugly woman?" The answer would be as predictable as the answer to the sort of the question which is asked in these surveys. It is like taking a survey at the Silver Ring at a horse-race meeting and asking each punter "Would you prefer the horse you have just backed to win or to lose?" There would be an equally predictable answer.<br><br>
If the same survey had been carried out in the middle-range and large firm sector, the answer would have been the same. It has nothing to do with inhibitions on small firms. I repeat what I said earlier, and I do so only because the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South-West started the hare again. The small firms that I know very well in the East End of London are run by men who do not lie awake at night worrying about the Employment Protection Act. They lie awake at night worrying about where they will get the finance to do the bit of expansion that they want and whether that expansion will produce enough profits to cover the 18.5 per
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1019">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 965</span>
cent. that they have to pay for that extra finance. They have other worries as well, but that is the basic worry, not the Employment Protection Act.<br><br>
f a survey asked employers whether they would sooner be without the fire regulations, or asked employers in the chemical industry whether they would sooner be without the services of the Alkali Inspectorate, of course one would get "Yes" from very many of them.<br><br>
All that argument is thoroughly specious. It is the second most specious argument which was used by the right hon. Gentleman the other day and again by the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South-West today. The most specious argument is that concerning what is done in other countries.<br><br>
Industrial relations legislation varies in all the major industrial countries. In one field, country A is a little more progressive than country B, and in some other field country B is a little more progressive than country A. If the argument of the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Gentleman means anything at all, it is that we should take the most restrictive features of the industrial relations legislation in other countries and ignore those areas in which they are more progressive than we are.<br><br>
What would be the reaction of hon. Members opposite to the proposal—we know what it is, because they have reacted in the past—that we should legislate in this country something like the <i>Mitbestimmungsrecht</i> that is enjoyed in the Federal Republic of Germany, which gives rights to workers' representatives undreamed of in this country? Would they be in favour of that? Answer, "No". So they want to copy Germany where it is tougher than we are but not where it is more progressive than we are.<br><br>
What would be the reaction of hon. Members to a proposal that the TUC should exercise as much influence over Government policy as the LO in Sweden does over Government policy? They would be horrified. They are saying that we should carefully compare all our industrial relations procedures with those of other countries, and where they are better than ours we should ignore them but where they are worse than ours we should copy them. That really is specious. To put forward an argument like that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 966</span>
is an insult to the intelligence of one's listeners.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman said that in certain circumstances there is no means of quantifying from actual practice the likely effect of something. For example, one cannot ask an employer who has not started in business. He is quite right about that. One has to assess probabilities. One probability that I assess from this legislation is that it will tend to fossilise the small firm into continuing as a small firm. If the Employment Protection Act is such a burden on small firms as the Government contend, and if employers in small firms are so mad keen to be relieved of the obligations of the Employment Protection Act as they contend, why should a firm with 20 employees ever engage the twenty-first? It is a serious question. If these considerations loom as large in the minds of small employers as hon. and right hon. Gentlemen suggest, why on earth should the employer of 20 men take on a twenty-first?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend considered another possibility, that it will also be a disincentive to labour mobility? The hon. and learned Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong, but it would appear to me that an employee moving from one small firm to another—which may be a very desirable thing to happen—will put his rights in peril.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that is right. I am concerned about the limiting effect on the incentive to small firms to become a bit bigger. After all, what is the ambition of every small firm? It is to grow, is it not? It is right that that should be so, and absolutely laudable that it is so. All my business experience leads me to believe that it is very seldom—at any level of size—that a firm stays still. Those that do not grow decline. Sometimes the growth or decline is slower and sometimes it is faster. It is very rare that a firm has gone on unchanged, unless it is in a very specialised market, supplying something to a market which by its nature is fixed. Unless there is something of this nature, a firm either grows or declines.<br><br>
It is good that small entrepreneurs should seek growth. Here we have something which is a direct disincentive to growth beyond a point which,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1020">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 967</span>
whether it be 19 or 20, as we have now altered it, is absolutely arbitrary. There are real dangers in this, and the Government will find, if the Bill is enacted, that it will provide them with more headaches than they bargained for. They will get their cheers over this at their party conference, which is the main motivation for this Bill, let us face it. It has nothing to do with industry at all; it is to enable people to acquire medals at the party conference. But when the noise of the cheering subsides and the people running the Department have to face the difficulties that arise out of this legislation, they may well live to rue the day.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cyril Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to intervene, but as the debate has proceeded, I confess, it has whetted my appetite. I agree with much of what the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) said, except his last sentence when he said that the Minister or his colleagues might get medals at the Tory conference or cheers for this proposal. I am not so sure that they will get medals or cheers.<br><br>
For example, I very much doubt that all the thousands of trade unionists that we are told now attend Conservative conferences will cheer how the clause will affect them. I doubt very much, too, that the industrialists who attend their conference will cheer, either. The large industrialist will not cheer because this clause will put him at a disadvantage as opposed to the small industrialist, and the small industrialist will not cheer because what this clause will do is involve him in more administration, more bookkeeping, more need to have one eye on the law all the time. Perhaps I can come back to that in a few seconds.<br><br>
I agree with the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow. I have said many times that I have never subscribed to the view that the unfair dismissals section in the Employment Protection Act is in some way preventing or discouraging small employers from employing labour. I do not subscribe to that view, and I do not believe it to be based on fact or reality.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
What determines whether one takes on labour is, first of all, one's rate of productivity, and second, one's ability to sell that which is produced. I do not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 968</span>
believe that an employer is refusing orders—which is what is implied—because even though he would like to accept them, to do it he has to take labour on, and, if he takes labour on he will suddenly find himself up against an unfair dismissals procedure and therefore, rather than be up against that, he will decline the order and not employ the labour. I believe that that argument is cuckoo, and that is why I have never subscribed to the view that the unfair dismissal provisions work in that way.<br><br>
Of course, as the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow says, if one asks the question, one gets an answer. If this question is asked—I have been the recipient of many of these questionnaires—and I put them in the basket frankly—of course most employers fill them in and return them. The same employers were protesting about the number of questionnaires they received and were asked to complete. That is another matter. These questions are asked, and of course if somebody says to an employer "Would you like to be relieved of this section of the Act?"—because we are human and because greed motivates most human beings, which is why we want more money for what we do and why we want better standards of living, and the employer is no exception to this—of course he will say "Yes, I would like to be relieved of it". He would be daft to say "No". It really does not prove that this is preventing him taking on labour. If the Government believe that the removal of this provision will in any way contribute towards even easing, let alone solving, our employment problem, they really are chasing shadows because it will just not have that sort of effect and nobody would ever convince me to the contrary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has far more knowledge in this area than I have, but would he not accept that the new proposal may have a most detrimental effect on employment? If, for example, a business man has a thriving little business employing 18 or 19 people, and then is in danger of going over the 20 mark, he may well say to himself that bureaucracy will be created if he takes an additional order, that he is happy as he is and rather than become involved in the terms of clause 7,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1021">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 969</span>
he may decide he is doing nicely and leave it at that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that will happen, either, but I agree that it is arguable that it could happen. If the Government's argument is acceptable mainly because the present clause prevents employees being taken on, equally it is arguable that the clause proposed could have the effect that the hon. Gentleman said. As I said earlier, I do not believe that the unfair dismissal provisions have the slightest effect on employment one way or the other. What effects employment is the sort of thing that the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow was talking about. What do most employers with 20 or fewer employees want? The first thing they want is a good standard of living for themselves, so a man in that position buys himself a nice house. What have the present Government done to encourage that? They have increased the mortgage rate on the house that he is buying. So that is the first discouragement.<br><br>
Secondly, they need to borrow capital. There is not a great problem about borrowing capital. It is not the availability of capital that is the problem for small businesses. Certainly for small businesses which are reasonably established there is no problem in getting capital. It is whether they can afford the capital that is available that is creating the problem. Just as that creates a problem for small businesses, it creates a problem for big business which reflects on small businesses. What happens is that the big employer, to whom the small employer sells his goods, holds his payment up for a month, and so the small employer suddenly finds that the money is not flowing in. But he still has to pay his bills. So he has to borrow it from the bank, and he finds now that he is borrowing at a rate of between 17 and 21 per cent.<br><br>
I assure the Government that those are far greater deterrents to small businesses employing labour than anything under the unfair dismissals section. I put it to them that they have got this wrong.<br><br>
The Minister said earlier that he had had some representations that all small businesses should be exempt. I can understand the logic of that, although
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 970</span>
I would not go along the road. There would be some logic in saying that, if this unfair dismissals section was preventing small businesses from employing labour, all small businesses should be exempt from the clause. But that is not what is proposed. What is now proposed is not that there should be two grades of employees; there are now to be three different classes of employee. There will be those who were taken on before the Act but who have not yet completed two years; there will be those who were taken on before the Act who have completed two years; and there will be those who are taken on after the Act. This brings me back to my point about bureaucracy. Every time the employer has to consider dismissal, the first thing he will have to do is to look in his files to see which section of the Act applies to the employee. If he drops a clanger and picks the wrong one, he can find himself in great difficulty before a court.<br><br>
If the Government were doing something to bring everybody under one clause and were saying that all companies employing 20 or fewer were exempt from this section of the Act or that employees must have worked there two years before they qualified, I could understand the logic of it. I do not agree with it, as I shall shortly show, but I understand the logic. But it is really a bit of a nonsense to start differentiating between old and new employees, employees who have been there 12 months, employees taken on just before the Act, employees taken on just after the Act, and so on.<br><br>
I do not believe that the clause is viable in practical terms. It will be worked, of course, because that happens to all small employers. In the end, we realise that we have to work it, and we get on with it.<br><br>
One of the problems of many small companies that I know is the amount of money that we are having to spend on legal fees in order to interpret laws, in order to be advised on laws and in order to know what our rights are. This just adds a little bit more to the legal advice which will have to be sought. Let us take the case of an employee who has only worked for me for eight months. "Yes, but when did the eight months start, Mr. Smith?" "Well, actually it was on 1 June". "Well, the Act only
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1022">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 971</span>
came in on 3 June, so he will not be entitled to this section", and so on. It really is a mess, and I do not think much of it.<br><br>
Finally, I understand that the Government will have been under some pressure from some people to change the law as it now stands. I think a great deal of that pressure has come from seeking it rather than because it is real, and, if it had not been sought, I do not believe that it would have manifested itself.<br><br>
But if the pressure is there, surely there comes a time when the Government must decide on which side to come down. Under this amendment, they are trying to have their cake and eat it. They are trying to help, in their own way, the small business man. I do not believe that this will help him, but they are trying. At the same time, they are trying to retain the protection of employees. They must say where they stand. Security of employment is as important as wage negotiations and industrial relations. I have spent many hours talking to employees—not just my own. There are vast numbers of them who seek security of employment. It is an important issue to workers. I say "workers"—I did not say "trade unionists". The Government, on security of employment and tenure of employment, must come down on the side of the employee.<br><br>
Anything that weakens the right of an employee—that applies whether that man or woman works for a company employing two people or 2,000. For the individual, that is his job. It does not matter how many the employer employs. Security of employment is particular to that individual, and he is entitled to the protection of the law as far as it is possible and reasonable for the law to protect him.<br><br>
On the balance of argument, I am against the weakening of the position as it now applies to employees' rights. I shall vote against the Government amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The employer who dislikes employment legislation because of what he regards as unnecessary bureaucracy is of a particular temperament.

on with the job of running his business. He is just the sort of employer who will not welcome this provision.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman is a most skilful advocate, particularly when he has a weak case. He concedes that there is a case to answer, particularly over the irresistible argument that the clause introduces new bureaucracy, but that does not get rid of the bureaucracy and it does not get rid of the case.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman, who has been exceptionally courteous throughout the Committee's proceedings, cannot adopt such a cavalier attitude to the argument that this will create more bureaucracy and that the employer will have to notify the employee before recruitment, because if he does not it will debar the employer from special exemption. He cannot say "That is a strong argument, but on balance I dismiss it." More forms, more necessity to notify, and more procedures will be involved for the employer of 20 or fewer employees. He will not thank the Government for that one jot.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith). I could sympathise with the Government if they said that they would extend the provision to all small employers. It is even-handed and something that all small employers could understand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Radice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Understand, but not sympathise with.</span></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would understand and I would sympathise with the Government in their dilemma, in their desire genuinely to help and go out on a limb in helping the small employer. They have not done that. They are victims of their own election promises. They struck an attitude. They gave the impression to small businesses that they were the saviours—just return a Conservative Government and all form-filling, all bureacracy and all these difficulties over unfair dismissal procedures would be done away with. But when they come to examine legislation, they realise that that cannot be done or that it is undesirable that it should be done, and they have to come up with something, so they come up with this pathetic measure.<br><br>

There is nothing worse than creating in a small firm two statuses for employees. It is no good the hon. and learned Gentleman saying that he accepts that that is a difficulty but that in a sense it exists already. He is creating, putting on the record and bringing about by legislation two separate grades of employees, two sets of employees who are being treated totally differently by the law in a small firm of 20 employees. How would the hon. and learned Gentleman feel if he was one of the employees who were less well-treated? He would not be happy. Can he tell me how on earth that will improve industrial relations? I understood that the whole purpose of this elaborate Bill was to improve industrial relations. I cannot see how even the hon. and learned Gentleman, with all his considerable skills of advocacy, can convince me that this clause will do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is nothing to do with advocacy that I rise to answer his question about how I would feel if I were in the position of somebody who was employed by an employer who conies within the protection of the amendment. I would say to myself "I was told about that before I took the job. I had a notice. I was put on terms. I knew exactly what the position would he. I have no grounds for grumbling. I have taken the job on those terms, and I have no less rights than my neighbour. I have to work for two years before, if I am unfairly dismissed, I can complain of the consequences to a tribunal." I should say to myself "If I am differently treated from anybody else, that is because I chose to take this job, and I am jolly glad to have had the job".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, that shows the totally different attitude that Government supporters have from the attitude of Opposition Members. My hon. Friend has already said that a considerable number—whatever the percentage might be—of employees who work in small firms are paid low wages. They are the lowest paid amongst the community. They are not in the privileged position of being able to say "Should I or should I not join this firm? I should like to have a look at the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 974</span>
contract of employment. I should like to ask the employer to tell me exactly what my unfair dismissal rights are. When the employer tells me that, I will consider them. If I consider them suitable, adequate and legally sound, I am prepared to join the firm. If not, I will not join." They are not in that position. With unemployment at its present high level and with the figure that it is likely to reach before this Government are finished with us, many people will have no option. They will not feel happy because they have a written paper that tells them their lack of rights. They cannot say that they have taken the job voluntarily. They probably had no alternative but to take that job.<br><br>
In view of all the criticism of this clause from the CBI, from the Low Pay Unit and from the Institute of Personnel Management, the hon. and learned Gentleman is flying in the face of an overwhelming argument against the clause if he resists all the urgings that we have made, sticks to his guns and puts the clause through. It will be incomprehensible to many employers. After all, the Secretary of State himself, who is the architect of the Bill, found it difficult to explain the clause. The hon. and learned Gentleman, whose skills I constantly admire, did a far better job, but I do not think that many of the employers in small firms who are not happy and presumably do not have skilled staff at their disposal—and that is the reason the measure is being brought in—will welcome the extra work, the extra bureaucracy and the extra strain on industrial relations that this pathetic and ill-judged clause will bring about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As you will have seen, Mr. Goodhew, not for the first time we have a problem, which caused some slight difficulty even to you this morning, of having a Bill before us which is constantly 'being changed by the Government during the course of the Committee stage.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary talks about the great pressures under which he has been. These pressures could not have come from the surveys that have been mentioned so often; and I may refer to them myself later. The pressuress to bring about these changes must have come in the last couple of weeks. I wonder where they have come from.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1024">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 975</span>
They could have come from the rest of the Government or the Cabinet; we do not know. All that we know is that, from time to time, the Secretary of State breezes in, makes an unintelligible speech, wields his broad brush in his bluff, agricultural way, and then we have to wait until the following day for the Under-Secretary to translate it into English so that we know what is being talked about.<br><br>
As I understand it, originally the Bill was to remove the unfair dismissal provisions for the first two years of trading of a small firm. That was the original intention. Now, apparently, this is to last for ever for a small firm—provided it does not employ more than 20—for every new employee. This is making the position far worse than it was before, and we know that this will apply to many people. A figure of 4 million has been mentioned as the total number employed by small firms for two years. This is despite the fact that, first, the Government have already increased the qualifying period of service for unfair dismissal cases from six months to one year and done that retrospectively, and secondly, the Government have shifted the onus of responsibility from employers at tribunals for cases of unfair dismissal. Despite all that, they now come forward with this further imposition. Yet the Secretary of State is on record on Second Reading as saying that he was no more certain than Labour Members that these provisions would help small businesses to employ more people. He said that he was not certain at all.<br><br>
We have been asking what evidence there is. The answer of the Secretary of State yesterday was that the evidence was anecdotal. What does that mean? It means that there is no hard evidence at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The same can be said of the Gospels.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would accept that. "Anecdotal" is who one spoke to last week in a saloon bar which is used by the Secretary of State. We have had anecdotal evidence from the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith), who speaks with great experience. He is the epitome of the small business man and from his great experience he has told us
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 976</span>
in no uncertain terms that this is nonsense and that it will even harm small businesses. We are relying on anecdotal evidence. I should have thought that his evidence was as strong as anybody else's.<br><br>
We heard from the Secretary of State yesterday, in further support for his case, that small firms were not doing as well in Britain as they were in Germany. Our large firms are not doing as well, either, as these in Germany and in the rest of the world. Our whole capitalist system is doing badly, not only the small firms.<br><br>
We all know that the real reason small firms are having such a bad time, and some of the big firms as well, is precisely, as the hon. Member for Rochdale said, because of the high minimum lending rate; this is the real reason for the difficulties. There is no basis for believing that the law bears more harshly on the small employer than on any others. It is quite ludicrous and absurd to elevate these anecdotes, prejudices and superstitious into accepted folklore which we are all to believe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman prepared to accept that between 1974 and 1979 our industrial production improved zero, whereas competitors such as Japan and Germany produced increases on their figures over that same period of between 4½ per cent. and 13 per cent? Italy had 4½ and the United States and Japan 13 per cent. We had zero per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely right. That process has been going on for a century, and I am extremely worried about it. I should like to explain why I think our economy is doing badly, but I am certain, Mr. Goodhew, that you would not allow me to go down that road.<br><br>
We are talking of evidence. The only reputable survey was the one commissioned by the Department of Employment and the Manpower Services Commission. That disproved completely the thesis of the Under-Secretary. There is not a shred of reputable evidence at all, and nobody has been able to show us any. The Under-Secretary, in his major speech on this point, did not use the word "anecdotal"; he talked about "psychological" evidence. In this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1025">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 977</span>
special survey on small businesses, it was found that the major problem was, quite clearly, lack of money. The second problem was low demand. Here is a startling statistic: out of the 301 firms polled, only six mentioned the employment legislation. A lot of them were worried about VAT. I think the hon. Member for Rochdale will agree with me that filling in VAT forms is quite a problem for many small businesses. What have the Government done there to help small businesses? They have doubled the rate of VAT. I am quite certain that small businesses will say "thank you very much for the great help you are giving us".<br><br>
Is it not therefore amazing that this Government, who are allegedly committed to helping small firms, choose to act on the least significant problem, employment protection? Nobody is really worried in the small business world about that. That is the only area on which the Government are prepared to act, whilst on all the other issues—the cost of money, VAT, form-filling—they are exacerbating the difficulties. The myth that this Government are helping small businesses is humbug and cant. Again, in the survey it was shown that only 7 per cent. of those firms indicated—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cyril Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We ought perhaps to place on record one other fact which I overlooked in my speech, which is the effect that the lending rate has on the value of the pound and the problem that that creates in the ability to sell abroad.</span></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is something that the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South-West (Mr. Page) might bear in mind when he wonders why our economy is doing so badly.<br><br>
In that survey, only 7 per cent. indicated any reluctance to take on more staff. If there was a greater volume of work—the point alluded to—in those circumstances only 4 per cent. said that they were reluctant to take on more staff.<br><br>
When talking of percentages, at the last sitting of the Committee the Government wanted 80 per cent. of those eligible to vote before a closed shop
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 978</span>
could be established. Here they only have 4 per cent. on their side, yet on that basis they are introducing this legislation.<br><br>
All the other pressure groups were completely phoney. The National Federation of Self-Employed sent in a statement that 50 per cent. of the people who responded said that this legislation would damage them. Are you aware, Mr. Goodhew, that 98 per cent. did not reply? In fact, only 1 per cent. said that. The Engineering Employers' Federation sent out one of these questionnaires. The receipients had the good sense to behave like the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith). They put them straight in the waste-paper basket. Four-fifths did not reply, yet they made representations to the Government.<br><br>
Instead of any evidence—and we have not heard any at all—of what the Government are doing, if we are to credit them with anything, when they say that they hear anecdotes from places to which they go and they think that this might affect the psychology of employers, they are pandering to ignorance and prejudice. What they should be doing is educating and explaining to employers how they should behave in a civilised way.<br><br>
There are real problems for small business men. No one would be more pleased than ourselves if these could be overcome so as to increase employment. What are the real problems? They are problems of finance and of lack of orders, and they will remain after the Bill is railroaded on to the statute book. On the admission of the Under-Secretary, all that this is doing is trying to hoodwink employers or, as he says, to have some psychological effect on them.<br><br>
What are these small firms about which we are talking? Sometimes we have a romantic view about small firms hut, unfortunately for the workers concerned in them, small is not always beautiful. One of the main characteristics of firms such as hotels, catering firms, laundries, hairdressers, the distributive trades is low pay. Other characteristics are the high turnover of labour and the low rate of unionisation. Most of them have no trade unions. So any problems of small firms cannot be blamed on the trade unions because by and large they do not have trade unions.<br><br>
So it is clear to any body who actually
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1026">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 979</span>
studies small firms and the workers who work in them that they are more in need of more protection, not less. The Department of Employment's figures show that one-half of the the unfair dismissal claims came from firms with fewer than 100 workers. One-quarter of unfair dismissal claims came from firms with fewer than 20 workers.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary was very anxious at a previous sitting to admit sharing paternity for the concept of unfair dismissal. He now wants to abolish the area where most of the unfair dismissal cases occur. So he is not proving a very good father. He is making his offspring something of an orphan; where it matters most and for his weakest children, he will abolish the protection that he previously claimed to give them.<br><br>
These workers are to be disfranchised and discriminated against. We shall have a second tier of workers—a second class of workers with a sliding scale of justice. If we subscribe to the idea that we should help small businesses and if the Government want somehow to help small businesses, there are worthier, nobler and more effective ways of doing it.<br><br>
One wonders whether this is the real reason. The Chief Secretary said that he was budgeting for another 300,000 unemployed. The Government are deliberately setting out under their Friedmanite policies to create more unemployment. Perhaps this legislation is just a way of enabling that unemployment to come about. I agree with the Low Pay Unit. I shall not quote it again.<br><br>
The Institute of Personnel Management wrote to us as late as 3 March strongly opposing this concept and asking the Government to amend it. The Government have amended it, not to eliminate this discrimination but to make it worse. It is shameful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is ironic that while fulsome tributes are paid to the value of small industries and the need to do everything to encourage them, hundreds of small businesses are going bankrupt every month because of the fiscal and economic policies of the Government.<br><br>
We have heard a lot of statistics in our debate on these clauses. I should like to see the number of small firms that were started 10 or 15 years ago com-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 980</span>
pared with the number that have started since the Government assumed office. I should think that there has been a tremendous decrease in the number of small firms operating. Anyone who tries to start a small firm in our present economic circumstances wants his head examined.<br><br>
The formidable case put by my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) shows that the question that we are discussing is only a minor irritant to small employers. Their real worries are problems of borrowing money at 18 per cent. to 20 per cent. interest, of the doubling of VAT, of exporting when the pound is overvalued, and of the cuts in public expenditure, particularly by local authorities. That alone will mean that hundreds of small firms in the building industry will be bankrupt in the next few months. Many of them rely upon orders from local authorities for their businesses to continue.<br><br>
We have been discussing these clauses in the context of whether this is good or bad for small businesses. I want to put another aspect of the problem. I wonder if the Government have ever paused to consider the reaction of the trade unions to this legislation. If a man decides to start a small business, he must first get his capital, and he will pay through the nose for that. But the second thing that he must do is recruit a work force. There are few industries composed entirely of unskilled workers. They have to take a percentage of skilled workers and technicians, most of whom are members of trade unions. Trade unions will have an attitude towards discrimination between their members, some of whom will be protected by the employment protection legislation and some of whom will be outside the scope of this legislation. They will take a jaundiced view if they are to recommend their members to work for a small firm recently established where they will not be protected by the employment protection legislation.<br><br>
In the trade union movement, trade unions at district level give guidance to their members seeking employment. At one time, lists were issued to them of firms to avoid. In most localities the trade unions know who are the good employers who have been long established and have good working relation-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1027">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 981</span>
ships with the trade unions, and who are the bad employers, who often pay below the union rate and where conditions are deplorable. The trade unions steer their members. They say "Don't go to Messrs. So-and-so, where conditions are bad. We will steer you to an employer who recognises good trade union conditions of work for his employees."<br><br>
No one knows in a newly established business what sort of firm is likely to emerge. One does not know whether the employer will be a good one, because he has no history. One does not know what the working conditions are likely to be. One does not know the type of employer that one is dealing with if he has only recently come into the market.<br><br>
The cases of unfair dismissal are likely to be greatly increased in firms of this description. In firms that have been established for decades, where the relations between unions and management have been harmonious, there are likely to be few cases of unfair dismissal. But in a new enterprise, with all the irritability caused by new methods of production, getting new machinery started and so on, one does not know if the manager is a good manager, if the foreman is a bully and what the conditions are like, and there are likely to be many more claims of unfair dismissal than in industries established for a number of years.<br><br>
The trade unions will say to their members "We advise you not to work for that firm, first, because it has no history and we do not know if it will be a good firm, if it will recognise the trade unions and if the working conditions are good, and, secondly—and more important—because you will be discriminated against. You will not be under the umbrella of the employment protection legislation. You will have no statutory right to take action as other workers have in long-established firms. Because you will be a second-class citizen if you work for this firm, we advise you not to seek employment with that firm".<br><br>
There is a great deal of competition, particularly among small firms, for skilled labour. Big industries have few problems because they train their own apprentices. But a small industry, which has no apprentice system because it is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 982</span>
just starting, has to poach from the larger firms with training schemes. It will have great difficulty in obtaining skilled labour, because the unions will not tolerate these clauses which discriminate between one union member and another.<br><br>
The Government, instead of helping small business men, are putting obstacles in their way. They are making it more difficult for them to recruit the type of labour that they require. We are often told not to look a gift horse in the mouth, but if this is the gift horse that the Government are offering, small employers would be advised to look carefully at its teeth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Put it in the knacker's yard.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To put it in the knacker's yard, as my right hon. Friend suggests. They are not being given anything. They are being discriminated against as small employers. They are being asked to face obstacles in recruiting labour that are not faced by established employers.<br><br>
There are two points of view from which to look at these clauses: first, whether they are to the advantage of small firms, and secondly, and of equal importance, whether it is an advantage for the trade unions to recommend their workers to seek employment in firms that discriminate against union members.<br><br>
I hope that this 2 per cent. poll that has been conducted and which does not reflect the views of small business people might be conducted again and that these difficulties might be placed before small employers. I am pretty sure that if another poll were taken, they would thank the Government very much for their help, but say that they would much rather have help in the direction of reducing interest rates, creating an economic climate where they could function better, rather than pretending—and they are pretending—that they are being given something when it disappears when looked at closely.<br><br>
Therefore I hope that, in the interests not only of good trade union relations but good industrial relations, and in the interests of small employers who are contemplating starting up in business, these clauses will be rejected or amended in accordance with the Opposition's amendments.</span></p>

<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, because I recognise that we have had quite a long debate on the amendments proposed to clause 7. I lay the blame for the length of this debate entirely at the door of the Secretary of State because of his appalling presentation of the amendments on Tuesday night.<br><br>
I recognise the very severe pressures on the Secretary of State, and I have a great deal of sympathy for him in the terrible tasks he is undertaking. We recognise only too well the pressures on him in the Cabinet and in certain sections of his own party. It really needs to be said, however, that in circumstances such as this it would have been far better, particularly at that hour of the evening, if the Secretary of State had left the presentation of this complex amendment to the Under-Secretary and not sought to address the Committee.<br><br>
This morning, we have had to have a re-presentation of the Government's case by the Under-Secretary and, because of the misconceptions that arose from the Secretary of State's presentation, it took the hon. and learned Gentleman far, far longer than it would normally have done. We have, however, recognised that the hon. and learned Gentleman, in seeking to explain every aspect of the Government's case, goes on at length at times, although we are not complaining about that. But it has meant that the debate has been somewhat extended.<br><br>
I wanted particularly to speak briefly to the amendment, or in effect to the new clause, because more than ever this debate has exposed completely the hypocrisy of the Tory Party in this area. The only thing that can be said about this aspect of a nauseous Bill is that it was a manifesto commitment. We all know that politicians enter into commitments at election time. Some of them are dumped the moment they take office, others are trotted out at every conceivable opportunity, with Ministers saying that they were in the manifesto, irrespective of the merit, the necessity or the value of the manifesto commitment. This one was aimed straight at people's prejudices.<br><br>
It has been said many times by people who know far better than I do that surveys can be quoted and one can have loaded or prompted questions. It is im-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 984</span>
portant to quote the Low Pay Unit's Briefing No. 1 on the Employment Bill, as most Members of Parliament who are concerned about employment and low pay have a very high regard for the work done by the Low Pay Unit.<br><br>
I wish to make it perfectly clear that I am not attributing to the unit political stance, because I am sure that all hon. Members will well recall that during the lifetime of the Labour Government it put out many briefings which were attacks upon the Labour Government's approach to low pay and embarrassed some of us very considerably.<br><br>
On page 3 of Briefing No. 1, the Low Pay Unit puts the position succinctly and in a nutshell:
<br><blockquote><p>"… the questions in the pressure group surveys tended to be of a somewhat leading nature, perhaps suggesting issues to their members that they would not have otherwise considered. A survey entitled 'Employment Protection or Prevention' (conducted by the Conservative's Small Business Bureau) requested members to provide 'ammunition' for the Conservative Party. In addition to the prompting questions, it is likely that ideological motivation played a part in some of the responses. Although unfair dismissal provisions have been in force since the Conservative Industrial Relations Act of 1971, it is clear from the numerous documents we have studied that many people associate the extension of employees' rights with Labour's Employment Protection Act, which is often stated to have been 'trade union inspired.'"</p></blockquote>
That sums up the arguments of any fair-minded citizen of the realm against clause 7 as amended.<br><br>
To suggest that the Tory Party had something special in relation to small business is nonsense and poppycock. It was very well exposed by the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith).<br><br>
In this clause, the Government are creating a situation where we will potentially have two classes of citizens. There will be citizens who have cover for unfair dismissal—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Radice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In fact, there will be three classes of citizens: those workers in large firms who have certain rights, those workers in small firms who have certain rights, and the new workers joining small firms who will have different rights. So there are three classes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, and I accept his definition. I am making a general point, as I am sure he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1029">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 985</span>
will appreciate, that each section of workers will have a different set of law applying to their employment. That is at the heart of clause 7. It should be spelt out bluntly that we are talking about an employer who will be able to sack one of his employees for any reason. He will simply be able to sack him. He will not have to tell the man why he is sacking him. He will not have to give any reasons. He will merely say "You are sacked. Go home"—[<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. and learned Gentleman says "Rubbish".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not say "Rubbish". The hon. Gentleman is wrong to say that. If a man is sacked for trade union activities or membership or for any of the medical reasons, he is still entitled to unfair dismissal compensation. So the hon. Gentleman is putting it inaccurately, in a rare oversight.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may well be. I will study the Bill with care again. But having had some experience of some of the problems which are created in small business where often personal passions tend to run high because of the face-to-face contact between the owner of the business and the employee, knowing what has taken place in the past when the unfair dismissal legislation applied, the fact that we now have new legislation means that the majority of small employers think that the law is being changed in the way that I have suggested. If I am wrong, it means that a large number of small business men have been badly misled once again by the Tory Party.<br><br>
It should also be put on record that the overwhelming majority of men and women who own small businesses are first-class employers and have excellent relationships with their employees. They would not be in business if that was not the case. But, equally, we all know that there are cowboys among small business people. One only has to watch some of the programmes on television and listen to radio—"Checkpoint" is a good example—concerning some of the crooks and villains who operate in what could be called the small business sector. They exist. They treat their employees as some of them treat their customers, as people
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 986</span>
whose money is to be taken from them as quickly as possible. It has been suggested that, because of that type of employer, we should radically change the rights of our citizens.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman knows as well as I do that there are many issues affecting whether or not someone enters into a business and whether or not someone maintains a business. The hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) outlined some of the issues. I should like to mention two others.<br><br>
One of the main reasons for the decline of small businesses in the United Kingdom has been town centre clearances, where thousands of small businesses have been swept out of existence because a large area of the town or city centre has been redeveloped. The vast majority of those business men, unfortunately for employment prospects, have simply taken their compensation and retired, or taken their compensation from the local authority and then obtained jobs instead of carrying on small businesses. We all know that, Mr. Good-hew. This is the weakness of the Government's argument, because they are not doing anything about that.<br><br>
A similar problem arises in obtaining new premises after clearance has taken place or in seeking to obtain capital to restart. Many small businesses are run in not the best of environments in town centres, but they are being run from there: they are offering employment, and they are offering services. If they are swept away and their owners seek to obtain new sites to build new factories, the capital costs of providing new buildings and the cost of repaying mortgages are colossal and obviously put them off.<br><br>
If the Government want to help small businesses, one of the areas at which they could look is the level of the national insurance contributions, which in many cases is far too high. I was critical of my own Government in the last Session when we increased the national insurance surcharge. I think that that is detrimental to employment. Certainly, this will not do anything at all to help small business men. It will hinder business, and I stress again that it will have a counter-effect in creating employment to what the Minister has suggested.<br><br>

The Minister has repeatedly told us the detrimental effect that employment protection legislation has had on people who seek to create small businesses. But any small business man who reaches the point where he has 19 employees on his books is bound to say, "Well, if I go ahead and employ more people, I shall pass the 20 mark and I shall then come within the provisions of this pernicious Act"—so pernicious that the Tory Party is not repealing those sections so that it will not affect businesses with more employees than 20—"so why should I bother? Why should I not stay as I am, relatively small, relatively happy, relatively prosperous?"<br><br>
I accept the arguments which have been put forward by my hon. Friends and by the hon. Member for Rochdale that one of the issues which will flow from clause 7 is a new level of bureaucracy with a new set of forms to fill in. In that context, I believe that, far from assisting the small business man, far from assisting employment, it will be detrimental.<br><br>
May I also say that there is a great myth about the number of small businesses? It is significant that no one in this country actually knows how many small businesses there are. Some of the people who would come within the category of small business establishments are branches or offshoots of larger organisations: branches which are set up in districts to distribute the products of the other companies, sometimes using different names.<br><br>
I think I recognise from what the hon. and learned Gentleman said in his earlier reply that the provisions of the Employment Protection Act on linked employment will still apply. But I wonder what the impact on larger organisations will be when they see what is being done. Will they seek to circumvent the provisions of the Employment Protection Act? Will that not create
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 988</span>
further problems with their own trade unions? In other words, time after time, as we go through the Bill, we are seeing that provisions which are being enacted in the Bill will be a recipe for more trouble, more industrial action and more difficulties in industry and commerce.<br><br>
Surely we are all agreed about the need to set a framework within which industry can prosper. I submit to the Government that if they are seeking to help the small business sector, it is important that they start rethinking what they are trying to do in the Bill.<br><br>
I do not deny the right of the Tory Government to attempt to change the climate; that is what they would rightly claim they were elected to do. But it is significant that since the election, far from the employment situation improving, unemployment is growing. From the answers we receive from the Secretary of State every Question Time, it is obvious that the future is bleak and that unemployment will reach 2 million before the end of the year. Nothing in the terms of the Bill, particularly of clause 7, will create a prosperous small business sector.<br><br>
I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman to address himself to the serious problems that small business men in this country are facing. I think that most Members of Parliament recognise that very many of their own constituents are employed in this sector, and we should all like to see an expansion of the sector.<br><br>
One of the many problems that we have in relation to industry in this country is the growth of national and multinational corporations.</span></p>
