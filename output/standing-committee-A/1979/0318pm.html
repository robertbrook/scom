	<br><blockquote><p>"or a place of work either of other workers who are parties to the trade dispute or occupied or used by any person who is giving or is likely to give aid or support to an employer party to the trade dispute whether by way of trade, business relationships, arrangements for insurance against loss, or in any other manner whatsoever directly or indirectly."—[	<i>Mr. Harold Walker.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I. remind the Committee that we are considering at the same time the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 165, in page 13, line 41, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"or (	<i>c</i>) at or near the place of work of another person who is a member of the same trade union".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 167, in page 14, line 8, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"or place of work either of other workers who are parties to the dispute or occupied or used by any person who is giving or is likely to give aid or support to an employer party to the trade dispute whether by way of trade, business relationships, arrangements for insurance against loss, or in any other manner whatsoever, directly or indirectly".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 173, in page 14, line 20, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) In this section ' place of work ' in relation to a worker includes:
	<ol>
	<li>the whole establishment or site used or occupied by an employer within which the work is wholly or partly executed and is not limited to the particular plant or other section of an establishment or site at which a worker works;</li>
	<li>in the case of an establishment or site of which different parts are occupied or used by associated employers, the whole of such establishment or site as provided in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) above as if it were occupied or used by the employer of the worker concerned,</li></ol>
and in this section ' associated employers ' has the meaning ascribed by section 153(4) Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may
	<span class='label label-info column'>1306</span>
now sum up. I was explaining that the phrase "place of work" assumes enormous importance in the Bill. In fact, "place of work" is the phrase on which this whole clause turns. The notes on clause 14 which the Government have kindly provided and which are of great assistance make it quite clear:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The new description of picketing declared to be lawful when in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute covers:
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>"(i) a person picketing at his own place of work;</li>
	<li>"(ii) a trade union official accompanying a member of his union when the latter is picketing at his own place of work;</li>
	<li>"(iii) a person who does not normally have one particular place of work, or for whom it is not practicable to picket at his actual place of work, who may then picket at the premises of his employer from which he works, or from which his work is administered; and</li>
	<li>"(iv) an unemployed person picketing at his former place of work in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute connected with the termination of his employment."</li></div> <!-- ul --></p></blockquote>
The purpose of the clause is to limit the rights of lawful picketing to places of work and subsidiary places of work. Yet the notes on clauses contain one of the most throwaway lines in the history of legislation:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'Place of work' is not defined in the clause but for most workers the term has an obvious meaning."</p></blockquote>
It may have an obvious meaning for some workers, but I shall be interested to hear whether the Government are suggesting that the Court of Appeal, or the courts in general, would necessarily find the place of work to be quite as obvious as the workers are supposed to find it. There will be different interpretations and meanings. A plethora of legislation, different decisions and a general aura of uncertainty and complexity will be added to what is already a difficult field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give two examples of what, to workers, would appear to be obvious places of work. As the clause is drafted, there appears to be no entitlement for workers in a factory to picket a corporate head office even if the personnel policy intimately affecting the workers' wage levels, rights and conditions of work is decided only at head office. The clause as drafted seems to cast great doubt on whether a worker is entitled to picket a head office even if it is only at the head office that industrial policy and the workers' rights and conditions have been and are being decided, those matters being
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1205">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1307</span>
the very cause of the dispute—the reason why he and his fellow workers are picketing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do the Government seriously suggest that that obvious place of work—obvious to the workers—is not an obvious place of work to the Government? In other words, will the workers picketing that head office lay themselves open to an action for damages, which is the remedy that it is contemplated that the employer will have under the Bill in those circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without anticipating his later remarks, will my hon. and learned Friend contemplate the situation—a further step from the situation that he has just put to the Committee—where the workers may be protesting against the closure of their factory? As the factory has been closed, their picketing is irrelevant, purposeless and meaningless, and yet they still want—legitimately, properly and understandably—to protest against the closure of their factory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only place where they can do that is at the office, which may be here in London. Workers from a provincial factory might therefore want to come to London and make their protest known to the people at head office. Apparently, under the provisions of the Bill they would not be allowed to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall, of course, cover that point. Unless a definition of place of work similar to the definition proposed in this amendment is included in the Bill, then, in the judgment of many people, workers picketing in exactly those circumstances may well be liable to damages at some subsequent stage. This is a very serious matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Madel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take up the point raised by the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) about what happens when the firm has been shut or when there are difficulties. On page 14 of the Bill, in subsection (2) of the new section 15, there are the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"his place of work for the purposes of that subsection shall be any premises of his employer from which he works or from which his work is administered".</p></blockquote>
A little before that, paragraph (	<i>b</i>) states that that applies to a person who works
	<br><blockquote><p>"at a place the location of which is such that
	<span class='label label-info column'>1308</span>
attendance there for a purpose mentioned in subsection (1) above is impracticable".</p></blockquote>
Clearly, it would be impracticable in the circumstances referred to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unless I have misread the clause, what the hon. Gentleman says is not correct. Subsection (2) of the new section 15, as I understand it, applies to a limited range of people. It applies to people who do not have a set place of work—people who, because of the very nature of their work, are rovers. It certainly does not apply to every type of worker but only to a specific type—to people who perhaps are travellers or who have to move from one place to another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but it is not for me to answer it. I am anxious for the queries that I have raised to be answered by the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Attorney-General, who has come here for that specific purpose. If I am wrong, I shall, of course, bow to what the Attorney-General has to say. But that is my reading of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one group of workers who might find themselves in difficulties if they sought to carry out what up to now has been regarded as normal and proper industrial picketing. There is another group who also might find themselves in grave difficulty. Under the clause as drafted there appears to be no entitlement for an employee in one company to picket, or join a picket, at an associated company, even if that associated company controls the company with which the worker is in dispute. That is an important matter that the Government ought to clear up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the case of a holding or subsidiary company which occupies a large site. There is no reason why an unscrupulous or sharp employer, or an employer anxious to restrict as far as possible the right of his employees to picket, could not open up a site on part of the estate in the name of a subsidiary company. That subsidiary company would be employing separate workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a subsidiary company in a different name opened on a different site on the same estate, it could employ its own set of workers. In that way, even though there might be a general industrial relations or economic policy affecting every worker on that estate, the workers in that company might find that they had the right to picket only at a very limited area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as I can see, there is nothing in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1206">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1309</span>
the Bill—again, I am anxious to hear what the Attorney-General has to say—to prevent an employer setting up what I would call spurious subsidiary companies to limit the right to picket. This is a serious limitation of what has previously been regarded as a sacred freedom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the matter does not stop there. Since there is no definition of place of work and since the Government do not appear to think that a definition is necessary, under the new legislation—my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster alluded to this this morning—will an employee who works at a Leyland plant at, say, Longbridge, which is a big estate and has several plants, be entitled to picket on the same estate but at a different plant? It is an important question. Furthermore, is a worker at a Leyland plant at Longbridge entitled under the new clause to picket at, say, Cowley? Is his picketing lawful?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must answer that question. if they do not answer it and the clause is allowed to go through as drafted, the courts will answer it, possibly in a way which the Government did not intend, and certainly in a way which may severely limit the right of lawful picketing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the place of work is not clearly defined, the consequences for anyone seeking to picket can be serious. The purpose of the clause is to allow the employer to bring an action in tort against the unlawful or unlicensed picket. That is number one. But what happens if the worker seeking to picket pickets a firm on the same estate but on a different site where there is already a lawful picket? If the picketing of the person from the other site is regarded as unlawful, his immunity goes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But what about the immunity of the person who was lawfully picketing? If the act done by the unlicensed picket is an unlawful act in tort, giving rise to a claim to damages, it is possible that if he communicates or in some way combines with the picket who is unquestionably lawfully picketing because he is picketing at his place of work, an action for damages could arise as a result of conspiracy. It could be held that the lawful picket had been conspiring with the unlawful picket and, because the immunity of the unlawful picket will have been taken away by the Bill, the conspiracy to commit that unlawful act could lead not only to an action for damages against the unlicensed
	<span class='label label-info column'>1310</span>
picket but also against what I may conveniently call the licensed picket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the consequences will be severe. It is not enough for the Government to suggest cavalierly that a place of work is patently obvious. It is not, and I envisage a whole minefield of legislation capable of different interpretations unless the Government accept this definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend at this stage to stray further. I hope that I may speak in the stand part debate, in view of my good manners in speaking briefly to the amendment, and in view of your good nature, Mr. Good-hew. There is an onus on the Government, and certainly on the Attorney-General, to clear up these ambiguities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to know why, if a place of work is so obvious, the Attorney-General should object to this definition. It is clear, concise—more concise than some of the Government's clauses—and it certainly covers all the instances that I have put before the Committee of the serious anomalies that may arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like their explanation if the Government intend to resist the amendment. If they do not include a suitable definition of place of work, covering all the instances that I have outlined, I am afraid that industrial relations will be soured in an extreme way. Workers and trade union officials will be put in great uncertainty. The law will come into disrepute, and all the Secretary of State's good intentions and what he chooses to regard as a moderate line will prove to be ineffective and doomed. I shall be most interested to hear what the Attorney-General has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Goodhew. I apologise for raising this matter, but you will recall that, when the Secretary of State introduced his consultation paper to journalists, he used sound common sense in bringing out some large wall charts to explain what he was driving at. You will appreciate, Mr. Goodhew, that I am a simple man and I do not have the knowledge or learning of other members of the Committee. The clause is complex and it is difficult for me to understand it. But it will be people such as myself who will have to understand it when it becomes an Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will it, therefore, be in order to ask the Secretary of State to bring along and hang up his wall charts, so that when he speaks he can use them to explain what on earth
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1207">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1311</span>
he is talking about on clause 14 and the consultation paper being discussed with it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chair is occupied at the moment by a very simple man, but even if it were occupied by a highly intelligent one he would not be able to take upon himself, as the occupant of the Chair, the responsibility of providing wall charts or of asking anyone else to do so. But no doubt the hon. Member's request will have been heard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Jamas Prior)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I produced wall charts at a Select Committee meeting, I was told that they made matters worse confounded. So I promptly put away the charts. I believe that we can deal perfectly satisfactorily with clause 14 by using the clause itself and the knowledge of the contents of the working paper on immunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause stands in its own right and can be regarded in its own right. There is no need for the hon. Gentleman at this stage to worry too much about the wall charts and the difficulties of separating primary disputes from first customers and first suppliers, and so on. There will be plenty of opportunities for that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will they be available on Report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never yet known the House of Commons itself to get involved with wall charts in the Chamber. I am certain that by the time we put down our amendments—perhaps a new clause—on Report it will be so clear to the hon. Gentleman that he will have no need for wall charts. But if he wishes, I shall try to provide him with a pocket edition instead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of these amendments would be to widen the scope of lawful picketing beyond the pickets' own place of work. The amendments run directly counter to the purpose of clause 14. We therefore oppose them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why do we propose to limit lawful picketing to the pickets' own place of work? I want to spend a little time on this issue. At the height of the secondary picketing during the disputes of last winter, and again recently during the secondary picketing of the independent steel producers, that is a question which many people thought answered itself.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1312</span>
However, it is right that we should make our reasons clear and explicit, and that is what the clause seeks to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondary picketing is the most serious and the most abused form of secondary action. It is used to intimidate workers who are not involved in a dispute from going about their normal work. It is used to damage the business of employers who are not involved in a dispute, with the intention of spreading the disruptive effects of the original dispute so that whole sectors of industry are affected and the economy itself is weakened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Giles Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is a question of intimidation, surely that is a criminal act, and that would be a matter for criminal law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the presence of the Attorney-General, I say that it can be intimidatory action, and therefore criminal, but it can also be a type of intimidation. I do not want to get involved in the use of the word "lawful"—lawful intimidation—which the former Attorney-General used on the Floor of the House in the winter of 1978–79—about February 1979—when he spoke of lawful intimidation, but I think we all know what is meant by the sort of intimidation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No we do not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—which is certainly short of criminal intimidation. Perhaps I should say that it does not involve taking a pick handle, but it involves a fairly sharp use of words. I should have thought that that was the sort of intimidation that most people recognise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman agree that a sharp use of words is already illegal? Will be explain what forms of intimidation are not illegal under current law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that short sharp forms of words are not necessarily illegal at all, but they can be intimidatory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Threatening language—that is an offence, is it not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I hear one of my hon. Friends rightly say, it depends a little on the words. I should have thought than
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1313</span>
everyone understood exactly what was meant by intimidation of workers through a secondary picket which falls short of the criminal law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The extensive use of secondary picketing, including the use of flying pickets, for these purposes was something never foreseen by the legislators of 1906 who drafted the original legislation on this subject. Modern means of transport and communication have made it possible for large numbers of pickets to be moved about the country to extend the impact of industrial action far and wide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no coincidence that the scenes of violence and disorder which have disfigured our industrial relations in recent years have usually occurred where secondary pickets try to prevent people who have every reason and every right to go to work from doing so. That is the reality of secondary picketing, but no one would have guessed it from hearing the speeches of the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) or the hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me remind the Committee—and particularly Labour Members—of some of the remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition when he was Prime Minister. In January 1979 he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Secondary picketing has always been with us, but not to the extent that it is today … it is not designed to stop the blackleg from doing the job of the man on strike. It is intended to stop another worker from doing the job that he usually does. That is the distinction that I make as an ordinary citizen and not as a lawyer. It is my view that in these circumstances indefensible hardship can be imposed on innocent people and on people who are not connected with the dispute. That is why the spectacle of secondary picketing has aroused widespread criticism."</p></blockquote>
When the hon. and learned Member for Accrington talks about normal industrial picketing—I made a note of the words he used—he really is not talking about much of the picketing that we have come to know today as secondary picketing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I am talking about normal industrial picketing. What the right hon. Gentleman is talking about is abnormal industrial picketing. He is assuming, and trying to suggest, that all secondary picketing involves violence and intimidation of some sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman may well succeed, through the Bill, in stopping some sort of violent picketing. I would be with him in that; we would all be with him. But
	<span class='label label-info column'>1314</span>
what he will also do, and what he is aiming to do, is curtail normal secondary picketing, the purpose of which is to picket peacefully and to persuade. That is the case the right hon. Gentleman has to answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that. I believe that if the aim is communication, that aim could be achieved in other ways. I believe that it is the use of secondary picketing as a means of communication that has nearly always got us into so much trouble in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to continue with what the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition said when he was Prime Minister:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The present actions have highlighted the problems of secondary picketing, which did not attract continuous attention, at any rate in the past, and the Government"—</p></blockquote>
his own Labour Government—
	<br><blockquote><p>"certainly have a responsibility to consider what should be done to alter the present situation. "—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 16 January 1979; Vol. 960, c. 1546–7.]</p></blockquote>
It is the profound public concern aroused by secondary picketing at the time when those remarks were made which has led directly to our debating these amendments at this time. The amendments go to the heart of the clause. If the amendments were accepted, they would allow secondary picketing to take place as widely as anyone would like. The recent secondary picketing of private steel producers whose workers are in no way involved in the BSC dispute has reminded us all of what secondary picketing means.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have tried to distract us from the reality of secondary picketing, and the genuine and widespread concern it has aroused, by two stratagems. First, they suggest that we cannot discuss clause 14 until the new clause on immunities has been tabled. Paragraph 2 of the working paper which we published on 19 February makes clear that the Government's proposals for changing the law on secondary picketing are set out in this clause and the working paper proposals apply to other forms of secondary action such as blacking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change that we are proposing in the law as it affects secondary pickets is as clear as it could be. We are proposing to withdraw the present immunity from secondary picketing wherever it takes
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1315</span>
place, whoever undertakes it, and whatever the nature of the dispute. I thought that that was the burden of what the hon. and learned Gentleman was saying and the purpose of his amendments—that our proposals are too clear-cut and do not allow secondary picketing in circumstances where the Opposition feel it would be justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the second stratagem, which is to list the situations in which the Opposition think secondary picketing should be allowed. The right hon. Member for Doncaster dwelt at length on the "Nawala" case, but he neglected to mention that the "Nawala" case did not involve picketing. It was entirely concerned with blacking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the right hon. Gentleman listened carefully. I shall let him have the copy of my speech. Of course, the "Nawala" case involved blacking, but I was using that case to illustrate the interface between blacking and picketing. I was pointing out, first, that what most people would have considered a perfectly legitimate trade union action to stop the exploitation of cheap oriental labour was being conducted by seeking to black that vessel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That blacking would be prohibited or at least exposed to legal action by the content of the working paper. Furthermore, the Bill as it stands would even prohibit the picketing of such a vessel. I was pointing out that these two actions by the Government would allow what most people would consider to be an intolerable exploitation of cheap Asian labour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman must wait for the clause before he can draw the conclusion that the "Nawala" case would be covered by the consultative document—or, rather that the immunity would be withdrawn. That is not my reading of the consultative document or the conclusion drawn from it by others. But that we must wait to see when we table the clause on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman was dealing with blacking and the refusal of dockers to unload the goods from the ship. If it had been a picketing matter, it would not have been secondary picketing but picketing at the docks, presumably by the dockers at their own place of work. To that extent as well, it would have been primary picketing
	<span class='label label-info column'>1316</span>
and, therefore, would have been lawful under clause 14.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman must try to understand his own proposals better. In the consultative document published on 19 February, he says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in addition to these two general tests "—</p></blockquote>
the tests of capability and motive that he sets out earlier—
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is proposed that persons should be free to bring civil proceedings for any interference with their commercial contracts if this arose from secondary industrial action which took place beyond bounds that would be set in statute.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"These bounds would be set as follows. Where the inducement to break or interfere with any commercial contract arose in connection with industrial action, threatened or actual, taken in furtherance of a trade dispute by 	<i>employees of the employer in dispute"</i>—</p></blockquote>
that is the Secretary of State's emphasis, his underlining—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the person inducing the breach or interference would continue to have immunity under section 13."</p></blockquote>
The implication is that if the individuals engaged in the industrial action were not employees of the employer they would not have the immunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this case, the dockers would not be employees of the employer engaged in the dispute. The employer would be the owner of the MV "Nawala", not the National Dock Labour Board or the local dock labour board. Hence, if they blacked the vessel, they would have no immunity from action and, furthermore, if they picketed, they would presumably have no protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have already pointed out, this is the result of the mere act of picketing. It must be that I cannot make myself clear. I was trying to point out that picketing is often intended to induce a breach of commercial contract. If the picketing was effective in this kind of situation, it might have the effect of inducing a breach of commercial contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the vessel cannot offload the iron ore awaited by British Steel at Redcar, British Steel may say that the vessel owner is in breach of his commercial contract. Am I right, or am I wrong? Perhaps the Attorney-General will correct me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to help the hon. Gentleman. If he reads on to para 18—although I think that this has only passing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1210">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1317</span>
relevance to the clause and the amendment—he will see that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Exactly the same position would hold in the case of secondary industrial action in furtherance of that trade dispute by employees of those first suppliers or customers of the employer in dispute who were not themselves party to the dispute but who regularly conduct a substantial part of their business with such a party."</p></blockquote>
That would be the dockers, or it could be the tug. They would be first customers or buyers, whichever way one likes to look at it, of the ship that is the cause of the dispute or blacking. Paragraph 18 makes it clear that, in our proposals, they would also be covered by immunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to pursue this too far, because it does not have much relevance, and this is only a consultative document. But, taking the right hon. Gentleman's point, there is no doubt that, as the consultative document is at present composed, in the case of the "Nawala" the dockers who blacked it would be in the position of first suppliers and would enjoy immunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After that little intrusion into the consultative document, I shall return—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would that cover the International Transport Workers Federation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are seamen. The problem is that the seamen themselves could black, but the other seamen, away from their own place of work, could not picket. In this case, the international seamen went to the dockers to ask them to black. As I understand it, they were doing the inducing and therefore would be immune.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would be immune?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would be covered by immunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us look more closely at the terminology of clause 14. Although it does not at any point use the word "picketing" except in the title, we must assume that the definition of picketing is that set out in the clause. It includes people in the circumstances that we have just been talking about, who are not employed by the ship owners, going to the docks
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purpose only of peacefully obtaining or communicating information, or peacefully per-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1318</span>
suading any person to work or abstain from working."</p></blockquote>
In other words, one envisages an official of the International Transport Workers Federation from London, Brussels or wherever his headquarters may be, going to the docks and saying to the dockers "We have a dispute with this shipping company because of the way in which they underpay their crew, sack seamen and take on cheap labour. Therefore, we should like you to black their ship and not unload their cargo." Is that official picketing or not? He is doing precisely what the clause sets out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, he is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The official is attending at a place, which is not his own place of work, for the purpose of peacefully communicating information. Why, therefore, would he not be covered by clause 14?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because he would have to be picketing. If he had come from Brussels, London or wherever, to the docks, he would not have to picket the ship himself in order to tell the dockers "This ship is employing labour which we think is being paid below the rates of the international federation and will you please black it". He would not have to picket to do that. He would communicate that to the dockers. He could do that on the telephone, by word of mouth or in a dozen other different ways. That might not necessarily include picketing. However, if he decided to take a group of people with him and then formed a picket, that would be picketing. There is a great deal of difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We return to the question which appears to be causing the Opposition such confusion, the issue that is worrying them—whether the working paper proposals will prevent some people in some circumstances from picketing at their own place of work. That is one of the questions that has been asked by the right hon. Gentleman. Let me make it quite clear. In the first place, clause 14 does not restrict lawful picketing to those employees who are in dispute with their employer. If other employees of the employer in dispute go on strike in sympathy, they too can lawfully picket their own place of work whether or not it is the same place of work as that of the employees involved in the original dispute. Secondly, it is our intention that anyone who is lawfully on strike should be able
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1319</span>
lawfully to picket his own place of work. Nothing in our proposals for changing the law on immunities in general would affect that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we come to whether it is legal to picket at one's place of work, may we return to the question of secondary picketing? As usual, the-Secretary of State has used some emotive words to suggest that all secondary picketing comes under the heading of either mass picketing or intimidation, and he has ignored what my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) said about secondary picketing in some circumstances being a proper and understandable way in which to go about one's business. May I cite an example of cases that the right hon. Gentleman, or his successor, will find on his desk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that there is an industrial dispute at a ship repair establishment. It need not necessarily be a strike. It could be a ban on overtime or a work to rule. When the employer recognises that he will not meet the contract date for completion of the ships, he transfers or sells the contract to repair those ships to another ship repairer further down the river. Of course, the ships will be taken out of the first ship repair yard and transferred to the yard down the river.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Secretary of State will understand that the work force in dispute in the first ship repair yard would naturally assume that it had the right to take action at the second ship repair yard. However, as I understand the Secretary of State's proposals—I have listened carefully to his words—it would be illegal for those workers who, as it were, were watching their work sail down the river to another yard, to secondary-picket at the place where those ships were being repaired. Does not the Secretary of State accept that that would cause many industrial problems?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) gave a number of examples of what he thought would cause difficulty. I shall come to those later and shall take the hon. Gentleman's point on board at that time. May I continue to try to set the scene and come to the particular points raised at the right time in my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition also attempted to argue that clause 14 in combination with the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1320</span>
working paper proposals would leave unions with no means of taking action against employers who supplied goods to employers in dispute or did work for them during a dispute. This is not so. In the working paper we quite clearly propose that the employees of such customers and suppliers should be able to take supportive action. All that clause 14 does is to withdraw the immunity from secondary pickets who go from the firms involved in the original dispute to other firms so as to blockade them or otherwise prevent the workers of those other firms going about their normal business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances described by hon. Gentlemen, we believe that the employees of other firms that are supplying the firm in dispute should be allowed to make up their own minds as to whether they wish to take supportive action and not be forced into doing so against their will by secondary pickets. In other words, there are many ways in which the members of a union who are in dispute with their employer and wish to bring pressure to bear on another employer, or perhaps the same employer on another site, or a ship repairer in another yard, can bring pressure to bear on the employees of that firm—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But they must not picket.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—without picketing. We are saying that it would be unlawful picketing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I understand the right hon. Gentleman correctly, that applies even if the workers are not engaging in mass picketing or any of the other horror scenarios that apparently lurk in the right hon. Gentleman's mind. It even applies where chaps go along to communicate and persuade peacefully, as they are at present entitled to under the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) described one hypothetical situation—not so hypothetical—and I described another, where work was being sent out from a firm in dispute. I suggested that the chaps at the firm in dispute might want to ask their mates at the other firm "Do you know that you are working on stuff for our boss with whom we are in dispute?" They might go without any mass picketing, without any attempt to block supplies, but merely to tell them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1212">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1321</span>
The right hon. Gentleman, if I understand him aright, is saying that henceforward they shall not be able to do that, on pain of being exposed to an injunction and action in the civil courts. Is that what he was saying? We must be clear about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the workers are picketing in the normal sense of the word, and thereby disrupt the contracts, whether it be lorries or people going in and out—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Peacefully communicating and persuading is what we are talking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—and they are picketing away from their own place of work, they would not then have the immunity under section 13. I must make that plain; that is what it is all about, and what it has always been about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is what it is about, and if "place of work" is so important, why does the right hon. Gentleman not define it in the Bill, so that at least people know whether they will act lawfully or unlawfully, and whether they will be liable for damages? Why does he reject that? Or perhaps he does not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The more the right hon. Gentleman develops his argument, the more difficult I find it to understand why he makes any distinction in principle between secondary picketing and picketing of any kind. Why not ban the lot, if what he is really after is to stop intimidatory action, as he sees it. That is not necessarily confined, on those rare occasions when it happens, to secondary picketing. One can have the same situation on a primary picket. Surely, the right hon. Gentleman is taking a very dangerous path.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cyril Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be anticipating the right hon. Gentleman's speech. If so, no doubt he will say so. If I am not anticipating it, may I ask him to take on board at some stage in his speech the question which I now put to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I can follow what the Government seek to do. I do not follow how they propose to do it. I hope that some scenario may be given to us during the Minister's statement. Let us say take Mr. Scargill as an example. I do not think that he will mind, because he is a good
	<span class='label label-info column'>1322</span>
friend of mine. Let us assume that Mr. Scargill says to 2,000 miners in Yorkshire "Never mind what the law says. Go and picket that factory" and they do it. What will the Secretary of State do? He will do nothing. I understand that. He will tell the employer to do something about it. Let us assume that the employer obtains an injunction against those miners. How will it be enforced? What will happen?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will give us—not necessarily at this point in his speech, but at some time—some indication of how the law, assuming the Bill becomes law, is to be enforced to the point where secondary picketing can reasonably be expected to cease. He has far more confidence than I that people will obey the law, as he puts it. I have heard him say on many occasions—in fact, he said it in the House this afternoon—that trade unionists obey the law. Trade union leaders, generally speaking, obey the law. But picketing involves not only trade union leaders but workers in large numbers. I want to know how the law is to be enforced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Secretary of State replies, may I say that it would be simpler for everyone to understand what he is saying if he were allowed to develop his speech, instead of being interrupted quite so often. The Chair is finding the argument difficult to follow, and I feel that other members of the Committee may have the same difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I could get on with my speech without having it picketed quite so often, I might be able to make some progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General is here. If he does not deal with the particular point raised by the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith), I shall do so, but I think that it is a matter which my right hon. and learned Friend may be able to develop better than I can do. May I just say that if it is 2,000 people from the National Union of Mineworkers, that almost certainly constitutes intimidation in its own right and is a criminal offence. It would therefore be more along the lines of the statement made by the Attorney-General in the House some two weeks ago than anything that relates to this clause and Bill, which deal with civil actions and not criminal law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Secretary of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1213">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1323</span>
State, but if that is so, will he explain why, in their hundreds, they were allowed to get away, for example, with picketing Hadfield's steel works? In terms of what the right hon. Gentleman has just said, that was intimidation under this criminal law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fact, as I understand, they were not. Although on one occasion the works was closed, on other occasions the police were absolutely certain that they could keep the works open. What is more, they arrested a good number of people who were picketing. I am not saying that it will be easy to operate, whether it be the criminal law or the civil law in relation to picketing. But I think that the country does expect and need some clearer guidelines than it has had up to now. I believe that the growth of secondary picketing, as has happened in recent years, has been abhorrent to the British people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disobeying the Chair's injunction, but I give way to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask my right hon. Friend to address himself to an even more fundamental question which arises? Let us take the example of any employer who has 2,000 or 3,000 employees, with perhaps a large turnover of labour, possibly in the south of England, and a lot of the people who are outside the works have Scottish accents or Yorkshire accents. If he goes up to one of those people—perhaps a barn-owl-looking man who says that his name is Mikardo and he is not—how will he know that what he says is not true? By what procedure will the employer recognise these people?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that in genaral in this Committee we have the debate on the first group of amendments rather like a "clause stand part" debate, but I do not want to get too involved in matters which are well away from the amendments under debate, to which there is a perfectly satisfactory answer. If my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General does not deal with the matter, perhaps we can come back to it. I want first to develop my own speech in reply to this group of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1324</span>
amendments, and perhaps we can deal with those matters later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are really saying that secondary picketing is the only way of letting the employees of another firm know that production from their factory is being sent to the employer in dispute. I do not believe that that is right or true. I do not believe that secondary picketing is needed for that purpose. There are many other ways in which it can be done. In fact, it could be done on the telephone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, for example, Ford workers were on strike at Dagenham and additional supplies were pumping out of the Ford factory at Ellesmere Port, it is inconceivable to me that word would not reach Ellesmere Port very quickly that extra work was being done there at the expense of Ford at Dagenham. Therefore, I do not believe that it is necessary to have picketing outside Ellesmere Port to make the matter known. I believe that it is that sort of picketing that has brought the trade unions and picketing into such disrepute in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us look at a number of other examples. An employer brings in a subcontractor to work on a site. If the workers object, they will picket the site, as they are entitled to do, because it is their place of work. Why should secondary picketing be involved? Again, there is the case of the bus driver who wants to picket. Clause 14 provides specifically that he can picket the place from which he works—the bus depot. Where else would he want to picket to prevent buses being driven out by other people? This makes sense. Again, if workers of multi-plant firms are on strike, they can picket their own factory. What reason would they have to picket other factories, if not to put pressure on others who do not want to strike?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the question was raised of placards left unattended outside a factory. Quite simply, it is not picketing if the pickets themselves are not present. Therefore, they can leave placards outside the factory if they wish to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman also asked whether workers could go to their head office to demonstrate or protest. The answer is that only if they stop workers going into the head office and prevent business being carried on there are they liable under clause 14. Normally the workers will want to demonstrate and not to stop typists and other head office staff
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1325</span>
going about their work. But if they do, they will be in trouble: they will render themselves liable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman was right in his interpretation of the clause. The workers cannot picket their head office but, provided they were not intending to stop anyone, they could go to their head office and complain about what was going on. But if they stopped people going to work, that would constitute secondary picketing, and therefore they would be liable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the amendments. Amendments Nos. 163, 165 and 167 would allow many types of secondary picketing to continue. Amendment No. 165 would allow members of a trade union to picket at any place where other members of the trade union worked, whether or not that were themselves in dispute. It would, for example, permit ISTC members on strike at BSC to picket at the private steel firms where other ISTC members worked, even though the latter were not in dispute. That is simply not permitted under clause 14.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 163 and 167 would permit people not involved in a dispute to picket a place where workers were in dispute, whether or not those workers were themselves picketing. Thus, it would remain lawful for anyone to picket where there was a dispute—for example, at Grunwick or, in the current steel dispute, at any premises of BSC—even when none of the people who worked there were themselves picketing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 163 would allow a person to picket the premises of any employer giving, or likely to give, support, however indirect or insignificant the employer in dispute. It would be necessary for the pickets to show only that there was some trade or business link or that some aid or support was likely to be given by that employer to the employer in dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would even allow picketing of insurance companies providing cover of any description to the employer in dispute. They would, therefore, enable secondary picketing to be used to spread disruption to employers not involved in the dispute and to cause hardship to wide sections of industry and the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 167 would enable mobile workers, such as lorry drivers, to picket all the premises that they visited in
	<span class='label label-info column'>1326</span>
the course of their work and almost any premises of an employer with whom their own employer did business. That would open the way for the kind of disruption of industry that was caused by secondary picketing in the road haulage dispute of last winter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 173 would provide what we consider to be an unnecessary gloss on the term "place of work". For most workers the term has an obvious meaning which will not cause them or the courts any difficulty. In most cases, pickets are not able to picket on a site occupied by their employer or associated employers, because that would constitute trespass unless there were some right of way through the site. Normally,
	<br><blockquote><p>"at or near his place of work"</p></blockquote>
will mean at the entrance or entrances to the whole site. Where, however, there is a public road through the site, the effect of the amendment might be to allow workers to picket at the entrances to places of work on sites other than their own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "place of work" is not defined in the Bill, because it would be impossible to define it in such a way as to cover all the varieties of work place. [	<i>Hon. Members:</i> "Ah."] But for the vast majority of people there is no doubt where their place of work is, or where they would normally wish to picket. It is better to leave it to the facts of each individual case to show whether a particular place is at or near the employee's place of work, than to attempt a partial definition, as does the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where there is likely to be genuine doubt about where a person can lawfully picket, the clause makes specific provision. First, there is the trade union official who is not employed at the place of work of those in dispute. The clause would provide for him to join his members on the picket line, if they were picketing lawfully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is the mobile worker whose job regularly takes him to more than one place, and those such as offshore workers who cannot picket their own place of work. They are specifically allowed to picket the premises from which they work or from which their work is administered. That is plain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, there is the worker who is not in employment and who has been dismissed in connection with the dispute in support of which the picketing is taking place. The clause would permit such workers to picket at their former place of picket all the premises that they visited in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1215">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1327</span>
work. New subsections (2) and (3), together with new subsection (I), which covers most people, deal with the classes of worker who might otherwise find it difficult to decide where their place of work is. Apart from that, we see no problems in enforcing the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am seeking to probe a little further, particularly new subsection (2), which states
	<br><blockquote><p>"If a person works or normally works—(	<i>a</i>) otherwise than at any one place."</p></blockquote>
I shall give the Minister an example which involved me. I worked for some time for a large electrical contracting firm, for the outside erection department, installing electrical switchgear. We were sent to many sites, particularly in the North of England. If employees on one of those sites were having a dispute about conditions, bonus or any one of a thousand things that can cause a dispute, would it be legal for them to visit the other sites, at which their fellow workers from the parent company were working, and try to persuade them to join the dispute to resolve the first industrial action? Would it be illegal on the grounds that they were secondary picketing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the answer is almost certainly "No, it would not be legal." They would be allowed to picket at their own place of work, which I imagine would for those purposes be
	<br><blockquote><p>"any premises of his employer from which he works or from which his work is administered".</p></blockquote>
If they were mobile workers who moved round the country, the matter would be covered by new subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>). That is where they would be allowed to picket, but nowhere else. They could not just dart around all over the place picketing. They could picket only the premises of their employer from which they work or from which their work is administered. I would have thought that that was perfectly plain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And does the right hon. Gentleman think that that will be accepted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In our view, therefore, clause 14 provides a common-sense and workable limitation on picketing which most people will understand and which the vast majority of people think is long overdue. I shall not detain the Committee to say so,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1328</span>
but every test of public opinion that has. focused on the particular issue of picketing has shown that the public—including trade unionists and including active trade unionists—are vastly in favour of this proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric G. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They were in 1971, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fact the last public opinion poll I saw on this subject—on the subject of the Bill in general—showed that a high percentage of Labour voters did not think the Bill was tough enough. It is rather hard for Labour hon. Gentlemen to make out that what we are seeking to do here is not supported by the vast majority of people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Never mentioned it. The right hon. Gentleman is putting up Aunt Sallys to knock them down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In pressing for this clause to be widened to allow virtually unlimited secondary picketing, the Opposition are ignoring the views not just of the general public but of the vast majority of trade union members. Scenes of violence and intimidation on the picket lines damage the reputation and standing of the trade union movement more than anything else, and the vast majority of trade unionists know that. The abuse of secondary picketing, backed up by the power of the closed shop, threatens the voluntary traditions of industrial relations in this country. If we do not take steps now to check that abuse, how can these voluntary traditions be expected to survive?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that all these amendments would widen the places where, and the terms under which, secondary picketing could take place. I ask my hon. Friends to reject them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely support what my right hon. Friend has said about the amendments. But I say to him again that he has not answered the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) or myself—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—and until my right hon. Friend does so, it is very difficult to see how the ends he seeks can possibly be achieved, because there is not the means—the machinery—to achieve them. Until we can be sure that there will be some way in which people can be recognised and identified in a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1216">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1329</span>
legal, lawful and peaceful fashion, how can we know that these admirable ends will be achievable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend must not believe that the processes of the civil law are as difficult as he seeks to make out. There have been a number of occasions in quite recent history when pickets have been identified. I suppose that one of the latest examples of this was in the Vauxhall dispute, when Vauxhall people from Ellesmere Port were seeking to picket dealers' premises in the south of England and also certain of the ports. Vauxhall very quickly found out the names of the people responsible for the pickets and took the necessary action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that this will be relevant at a later stage on this clause. But let me also say this to my hon. Friend. What we are involved in in this clause is the process of the civil law. In other words, we are leaving it to the employer whose business is affected to seek an injunction under section 13, because there is no immunity for the action that has been taken. If my hon. Friend is suggesting that it is not possible for a picket to be identified and therefore a case brought to the High Court—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—he is really suggesting that we have to move to the criminal law. That, to my mind, would be a very serious step. It would not be one that we should contemplate taking—certainly not unless there was widespread abuse of the system, which I personally believe will work. I do not say that it will work every time. I do not say that any of these things are perfect. But I believe that it is possible for the organiser of a picket to be found with reasonable ease and taken to the court and that many of the difficulties which have been envisaged—such as people wearing beards or giving Mickey Mouse names—will not arise. I do not believe that the trade unions would operate in that way. But I am perfectly prepared to return to this point when we consider a later part of the clause, when I think it will be rather more relevant than it is at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make two points to my right hon. Friend? Up to now there has been no ban on my right secondary picketing and therefore there has not been the .desire or perhaps the organisation to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1330</span>
withhold identities. But we are legislating for the future, not the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, I would not necessarily accept that there are only the two options that my right hon. Friend offers me: either removing the immunity of an individual or bringing in the criminal law. There is a third option: to join in any action an organisation or indeed to take out an injunction, as has been suggested in an amendment drafted by the CBI, against a group of individuals not named. But that option does not appear anywhere in this suggested legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is for very good reasons that we have not suggested that. We believe that it is right to go either for an individual picket or for the organiser of the picket—as has happened in a number of cases. In any case 95 per cent. of strikes are unofficial, and it would be wrong in those circumstances to go for the union. But we can come back to that point during our discussions on this clause. It is not particularly relevant to these amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has based his whole case on what happened last winter. He talks about secondary picketing being equated with mass picketing and intimidation. Of course, as my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition has said, there were problems last winter. But that is a very different matter from what is in clause 14. In fact, most of the examples which the right hon. Gentleman used would be dealt with by the criminal law, if they were as he said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend recall—my memory may not serve me well here—how many of the cases that caused concern during that winter were cases of secondary, as opposed to primary, picketing? My recollection is that most of the cases that caused concern and distress were primary picketing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend is right. The Bill, by the device of using arguments about the events of last winter—which were much publicised on the television—but really very often dealing with quite separate issues, has restricted picketing enormously. I can give four illustrations of that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, an employee will not now be allowed to picket his corporate head office
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1217">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1331</span>
where personnel policy is decided. Second, in a large corporation he will not be allowed to picket an associate firm. This has been established practice in industry for many years. There is no question of new types of flying picket. It is established practice, but under clause 14 it will not be allowed. Third, workers will not be allowed to picket the supplier or customer, which has always been accepted practice in industry. Fourth, sympathetic picketing will not be allowed. The clause is extraordinarily restrictive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not to mention the two new tests in the working paper on furtherance of industrial disputes—the test of capability and the test of motive. They could have a great bearing on the whole issue of picketing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned sympathetic picketing. That will be allowed, because the sympathetic pickets in that case would be picketing at their place of work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But if somebody alse came and wanted to picket sympathetically he would not be allowed to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give a clear illustration of that kind of picketing. Hon. Members will know that for some time there was a dispute in Garners Steak Houses, involving mostly immigrant workers who were seeking recognition for the Transport and General Workers Union, of which I am a member. The strike was official and those very inexperienced trade unionists were carrying their placards outside the steak houses telling people what their wages were—£30 a week or less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quite properly, I think, members of the Transport and General Workers Union, some of whom were Members of the House, went along to give those lads a bit of support. We stood on the picket line with them—a small group of perhaps two or three people outside a steak house. My hon. Friend is pointing out that that kind of sympathetic picketing would be unlawful and what I did would be unlawful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend explain the difference between secondary picketing and sympathetic picketing? I thought that the two were synonymous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1332</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely right—there is no difference if it is not at one's place of work. That is the point. I agree with my hon. Friend that the type of pickets who would go along to show their sympathy with what they considered a particularly good case would not be allowed to do so under clause 14.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I May help the hon. Gentleman in regard to that illustration? I was at a dinner last night and I sat next to one of the directors of Garners Steak Houses. He told me that one of his problems as an employer was that the police instructed him or his managers at various times that they were not allowed to go outside the restaurant for fear that there would be a breach of the peace. He may care to take comfort from the fact that, when this legislation is passed, employers will not be able to take names if there is any possibility of a breach of the peace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not absolutely clear what the hon. Gentleman's point is. We have established that the provision will be extremely restrictive. I am in a sense defending the right hon. Gentleman against the attacks of the hon. Member for Hendon North (Mr. Gorst), who is saying that the provision does not go far enough. It goes much too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have raised the issue of capability and motive, which could have a considerable bearing on picketing. I should like the Attorney-General to refer to it. There is also the issue of criminality. If we have the restrictive definition contained in the clause, we shall throw picketing into the criminal area. The Attorney-General admitted in his statement to the House. I shall put a case to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A policeman may come up to a picket and say "Do you work here?" The picket may say "No, I don't." The policeman may then say "Well, clear off then." The picket refuses. That immediately brings the matter into the criminal area, because the policeman ought to take the man away for obstruction or another criminal offence of that sort. Such a restrictive definition throws picketing into the whole criminal area. That is another charge against clause 14.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ma not sure about the example that my hon. Friend has just given. The evidence which the chief constables gave to the Select Committee
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1218">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1333</span>
on Employment, of which my hon. Friend is a member, suggested that the kind of situation which he envisages is unlikely to arise if constables take the advice which their chief constables seem to be giving, which has been to steer clear of the whole thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If they did that, first the constable would not ask the question "Do you work here, mate?" because he does not want to get involved. Second, if he did ask the question, he would be unlikely to move the fellow on. That is the view of the police authorities represented before the Select Committee, which throws it all back to the total impracticability of what the Secretary of State is suggesting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to my hon. Friend, two different things are involved, one of which is taking names. The chief constable said that they were not in the name-taking business, but they may have to be in the obstruction business. That is the point. Sir David McNee admitted as much to me in answer to a question in the Select Committee. He might have to be placed in this situation. I gathered from the tone of his voice that he did not relish the idea that he might be thrown into the whole criminal area by the restrictive nature of clause 14. This is an issue which the Government ought to take very seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Madel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman goes on, may we establish one point? When he referred to the Garners Steak Houses case—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Madel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. It was referred to in an intervention. The hon. Gentleman said that a policeman might come up and say "Do you work here? If not, clear off." I am sure that it has not escaped the hon. Gentleman's attention that clause 15(1)(	<i>b</i>) states that a person may picket at the place of work
	<br><blockquote><p>"if he is an official of a trade union".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, the point about employees of Garners being all on their own without guidance or help from trade union officials is not valid. It is well covered by this subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the next set of amendments, which I may introduce, so we
	<span class='label label-info column'>1334</span>
can deal with that point when it arises. The hon. Gentleman is right to that extent, but we are talking here about sympathetic action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been seeking to establish that this is a restrictive clause. If the right hon. Gentleman will not accept our amendments, it will make picketing very difficult. Apart from stopping picketing altogether, as I think the hon. Member for Hendon, North would probably like to do, I do not see how it can go much further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not get the impression that the Secretary of State was very glad or happy about the clause. I am not in the least surprised, because it is a dog's breakfast and seems to lead us into a legal quagmire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State mentioned a public opinion poll. I saw a public opinion poll on this matter in 	<i>The Times</i> not all that long ago, but I noted that it was accompanied by a rather ponderous editorial which pointed out that there was a large majority for the 1971 Act in public opinion polls, and we know what happened under the 1971 Act. Perhaps it is his experience of the consequences of the 1971 Act which leads the right hon. Gentleman to be less than happy at going over this ground again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want to spend too much time on public opinion polls because at the moment they indicate that the public would like to see the back of this Government. If the Government were to do what the public want, as evidenced by public opinion polls, they would all resign today, so perhaps the Secretary of State will not want to pursue that point too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like you, Mr. Goodhew, earlier in the Secretary of State's speech I was not too clear about a number of things, and I have to confess that at the end of his speech I still was not too clear. He started by saying that the clause was necessary because, if I remember aright, we could get what he called sharp words on picket lines. I do not know whether we shall have codes of practice on what "parliamentary" language may be used on picket lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this, as on most other matters, that the Minister has mentioned, the existing law is adequate. The Public Order Act 1936 makes the use of threatening or abusive words illegal. Surely, the whole matter is covered. Why do we need more law? A whole battery of existing law restricts picketing. One sometimes wonders that any picketing is legal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1219">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1335</span>
The Highways Act 1959 makes it an offence wilfully to obstruct the highway without lawful authority or excuse. The Police Act 1964 makes it illegal to obstruct the police. So does the Criminal Law Act 1977. That Act also makes it illegal to trespass. The right hon. Gentleman mentioned that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I am sure the Attorney-General will agree, the common law makes illegal an unlawful assembly where three or four meet with a common purpose so as to endanger the public peace or where the police believe a breach of the peace may be possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have referred before to my friend Mr. Piddington, in Piddington v. Bates. I knew him personally. He went to join a picket line where there were only two people. He made three. The policeman said "I suspect that a breach of the peace may be occasioned". So we do not have to worry about Mr. Scargill and his serried ranks and battalions. Existing law was sufficient to cause poor Mr. Piddington to act illegally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Prevention of Crime Act 1953 makes possessing offensive weapons illegal. The Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act makes intimidation illegal. The Secretary of State referred to that. All these actions are illegal already, so why is it necessary to bring forth further legislation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the Attorney-General is with us so that he can answer some questions. First, what is the place of work? Second, who is the employer? The Secretary of State says that the place of work will not be defined. That is wonderful. We are not going to define it at all. I do not know who we shall leave it to—the Court of Appeal or the judges. But we shall pass legislation in which there is no definition of the place of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who is the employer? For example, the 	<i>Daily Mirror</i> is owned by IPC. IPC is owned by Reed. Reed makes paper and, I believe, ink. Reed supplies paper to the 	<i>Daily Mirror.</i> Who is the employer of the man working for the 	<i>Daily Mirror</i>? Is it IPC or is it the parent company, Reed? IPC prints a vast number of different publications. Do the people working for these different publications all have the same employer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Express Newspapers group there is the 	<i>Sunday Express,</i> the 	<i>Daily Express,</i> the 	<i>Evening Standard</i> and the 	<i>Daily Star.</i> They are all printed in the same building.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1336</span>
Do those workers all have the same employer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By way of example, let us say that there is a dispute over the printing of a publication. The employer takes the publication from one factory and moves it round the corner. Are we saying that a worker who pickets his job, even though it is round the corner, and explains why to members of his own union, quite peacefully, is acting illegally? I think that the Secretary of State will agree that most picketing in this country is legal. Picketing takes place every day of the week. It is legal. A few examples are splashed across the television screens and the public get the idea that picketing is an intimidatory process. But I am sure that the Secretary of State will agree that most picketing is peaceful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give an example of what I think is intimidatory and yet is almost certainly lawful. "Don't go in to work. If you do we will withdraw your union card. "That kind of thing has been happening all too often in the last year or two. It is almost certainly lawful yet almost certainly intimidatory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the union were to be in breach of its rules, or if there were unfair expulsion, the case would be taken to the courts. Could the Minister tell me how many cases—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All right, go on then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not wash. The truth is that people do not carry it to that extent. They simply do not go through the picket line. That is what it is about. I am asked to state the number of cases, but the fact is that people do not go so far. They do not go through the line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, they do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question I put to the Secretary of State, with respect, was different. I asked whether he would agree with me that most picketing was legal and peaceful. He did not respond to that. His response causes me to wonder to what extent any new law of his will affect that situation. Did the 1971 Act affect it? It made closed shops in the printing trade void, yet there was not a single change.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1220">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

The procedures and practices carried on as before. Can this legislation alter that? I do not think that it is feasible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend will accept that the Secretary of State has just come out with one of his usual pieces of emotional rubbish. He could not offer one shred of evidence to justify his statement. The idea that a picket or anyone shouts at a worker "If you go through the factory gate we shall withdraw your card" is the sort of thing that the newspapers like to play on. In fact, only the executive council of a union has the right to withdraw any member's card, and a case would have to be made out to the executive council. Neither the Secretary of State nor the whole of the Tory Party can give one example of that happening over the history of the trade union movement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If such an occurrence did happen, under the existing law I think that that would be abusive language. It would be intimidatory and would be covered by the existing law. A publication may be moved round the corner, and workers would not be picketing their own place of work because it is round the corner. If they go and communicate peacefully with members of their own union, they are picketing their own job. Is that to be a crime in this country? If it is to be a crime, that crime will be committed. A law will be passed which will have no respect, and which will not be enforced, and the law will be made an ass. That is a dangerous thing to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General (Sir Michael Havers)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way so that he does not spend too long developing a bad point? Mere peaceful communication does not create any offence. It is communication coupled with persuasion and inducement. Just to say to one's pals "We are on strike in the next- door factory" certainly would not be picketing, and would not fall under any of these provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us say they went along and added persuasion and inducement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I was saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case let me go
	<span class='label label-info column'>1338</span>
back to my example. If I worked on a publication which moved round the corner because we were on strike and it was being printed there I should go along and seek to inform, persuade and induce members of my union not to print it because they were taking our jobs.

Let me pose this question. Many newspapers are printed simultaneously in different places. For example, 	<i>The Guardian</i> is printed in London and Manchester simultaneously. The 	<i>Daily Star</i> is printed in London and Manchester. The 	<i>News of the World</i> is printed in London and Manchester simultaneously. Let us suppose that there is an upset on the 	<i>News of the World</i> on a Saturday night because the machines are in bad condition, not maintained, dangerous, dirty or whatever the reason may be, and it is suspected that the management is switching production to Manchester. I, therefore, go to Manchester, stand outside the gate and wait for the father of the chapel to arrive, in order to inform, persuade and induce him. The manager comes along and asks "What are you doing here?" and I tell him that I am waiting to meet my colleagues to persuade, inform and induce. He says "Clear off", but I do not clear off. It is my own job, the same employer, the same publication, but is it my place of work? Am I becoming a criminal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not a criminal, but my hon. Friend would be acting unlawfully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So I would be acting unlawfully. It would happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that, in places where the 	<i>News of the World</i> and 	<i>The Sun</i> are printed in the same building, there is a dispute on 	<i>The Sun.</i> It would be quite legal for workers on 	<i>The Sun</i> to picket 	<i>The Sun.</i> They would stop paper and ink coming in. But what about the 	<i>News of the World,</i> where there is no dispute? Yet the ink comes from the same source of supply, and the paper is loaded into the same floor of the building. If the action taken against 	<i>The Sun</i> affected the 	<i>News of the World</i>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1221">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1339</span>
would that be unlawful? There would be two groups of workers on two different publications, but in the same geographical place of work and with the same employer. I should like an answer to that question, because that has happened in the course of my industrial life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the drivers who deliver the ink, most of whom are members of my union. I go to them and say "We have a dispute. This job is blacked", and I persuade and induce them. If they do not deliver the ink, will they be acting unlawfully? No paper will appear the following morning. The wholesalers have a contract with the publisher. That contract will have been broken. The retailers—the newsagents—will not get their newspapers. Can they take action against the lorry driver who did not deliver the ink?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In newspaper production we sometimes " up page "—that happens when a paper is bigger because of an advertisement about Saudi Arabia, or something like that—and the employer may then want more labour. There is a pool of casuals who work in the industry without any permanent employer. Those casuals do not have a settled place of work. Could they picket anywhere? Or do they have no picketing rights?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the case of journalists. We know the journalists in this place. Some of them might say that their place of work is Annie's Bar, and I am sure that we would not want that Bar picketed. But they send copy to, say, half a dozen different newspapers. Where is their place of work? Where would they have the right to picket?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a letter here from The Writers' Guild of Great Britain. The Committee may not have heard of that body, but it is affiliated to the TUC. It has negotiated minimum terms of agreements in every medium—television, radio, film, stage and books—governing fees and conditions. It is doing the same for video cassettes and cable—pay television. The guild claims that it is helping British exports by doing that. But what about a writer who works from home? Where is his place of work? Would he be able to join picket lines?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that a writer, working from home, has had most of his work taken by a certain publication for 20 years. Would he have the right to join a picket line on that publication? That is another question which I should like the Attorney-General to answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was an example involving Penguin
	<span class='label label-info column'>1340</span>
Books only a few weeks ago. The letter from The Writers' Guild says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Penguin Books recently ignored NUJ agreements when announcing restructuring plans involving redundancies. The NUJ Books Branch decided to black certain titles."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that the hon. Gentlemen will be delighted to hear that one of those was a book by my right hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South-East (Mr. Benn). The writers supported the NUJ's action. Would they have had the right to join the picket line outside Penguin Books?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The words "sympathetic action" have been used. That is what secondary picketing really is. It is sympathetic action. Another old-fashioned word for it is "solidarity". I do not know whether hon. Members think that solidarity is ignoble or wicked. I should have thought it very honourable. But whether one thinks that it is good or bad, the clause is basically trying to outlaw solidarity. That is impossible. It is impossible to outlaw sympathetic action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members may appreciate the point if I put it this way. We all try to help our friends. The United States has been having a bit of a disagreement with Iran. The Prime Minister goes to meet the American President and he asks "Will you help me? Will you join in action with me?" That is sympathetic action; it is solidarity; it is secondary picketing. He is basically saying "Will you join us in secondary picketing of Iran?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or of the Moscow Games?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is blacking. Some hon. Members voted to black the Moscow Olympics in sympathy with the patriots of Afghanistan—sympathetic action, secondary picketing. Conservative Members pick and choose when they want sympathetic action and solidarity. There is nothing ignoble about solidarity.

If the Government push this clause they will fail again as they failed in 1971. At the end of the day, they will have to answer the question posed graphically by the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith): what happens when it is not just two or three pickets? When Government actions so outrage ordinary, decent, honest British citizens that they turn up in large numbers and break the law, what will the Government do? Will they hire Wembley Stadium, arrest them and put them all in there? I

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And then send for the Official Solicitor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Send for the Official Solicitor or something of that sort, call a general election, hold a referendum, get the special patrol group—I do not know what the contingency plans are. They could do a whole range of things. But the net result will be that the TUC, instead of cooperating with the Government, will say "We shall wash our hands of the whole matter. We shall have no co-operation with this Government. We shall withdraw our guidelines. They are our enemies and we are in for a rough ride. We have been illegal in the past. There will be no cooperation. "It is because the Secretary of State realises that that could be the result that he was not quite so confident or happy about the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cyril Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the latter part of the speech of the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) is true and that was the TUC's reaction—it may be true—that would not in itself be a reason for the Government to decide to do nothing. But it would be a reason for them to make sure that, if they did something, what they did had a purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

I start on the basis that any man has a right to strike. That is not in dispute. The Government accept it. It therefore follows that if a man has a right to withdraw his labour he must have the right to make sure that the withdrawal of his labour has an effective result. That raises the question of his right to picket. I suspect that, at heart, none of us want to take away a man's right to picket. I certainly do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I interpret picketing—this is the point—it means using peaceful methods to persuade others to one's point of view. If that is what picketing is about, I suspect that there are few, if any, hon. Members who would want to interfere with a man's right to picket. I certainly hope that it is not something which we, as politicians, would want to outlaw, because it is what we do all the time. We spend our time trying peacefully to persuade others to our point of view. We are, therefore, as politicians professional pickets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is whether that is where picket-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1342</span>
ing now lies in trade union or worker action. There can be no dispute that we have seen examples over the past 12 or 18 months that have gone beyond the bounds of public decency. We have seen what purports to be picketing become bullying. We have seen it become intimidation. We have even seen worker against worker.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was an example, in the transport workers' strike last year, of textile workers from my constituency pleading with dockers to allow cotton to come into the country in order that they could work in an industry that was then bleeding to death, and has almost died since. The blacking of goods and the sort of picketing that has taken place over the past two years has meant that no responsible Government can ignore the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With all respect to Labour hon. Members, there are certain trade unionists who have only themselves to blame for any Government reacting as this Government have, in the light of experience of picketing over the past 18 months to two years. Having decided that reaction is inevitable, we must ask what form that reaction should take. I should love to try to ensure that people have the right to picket peacefully—practically anywhere, but peacefully. I want to see some move against those who do not picket peacefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue, therefore, is whether the clause effectively removes the possibility of scenes such as those we saw during last winter, and have seen in a mild form this winter in the steel strike, although they are in no way as bad as those of last winter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his only intervention so far, the Attorney-General weakened the argument that the clause would be effective. I understood him to say that whether one was intimidating depended upon what one said. So if this clause is to be enforced it will be necessary not only to identify the person who is picketing, or reputedly picketing, at a place other than the place where he works, but to prove, in a court of law, what that person was saying. That will be an extremely difficult law to enforce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout last winter, in my interventions on the Floor of the House, I used that the existing criminal law was sufficient to deal with intimidation. I made that point again when the Attorney-General made his statement in the House about picketing, and he agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We therefore have to ask ourselves whether the civil law now produced will make any contribution towards stopping
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1223">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1343</span>
the intimidation that is apparently unlawful anyway and that concerned many of us in the scenes that we saw in the winter of 1978–79. I strongly advise the Government not to pursue the clause if it will not be effective, because there is one effect that it will certainly have. The feeling about the clause has become evident, even in the hour's discussion we have had this afternoon—not just in the speeches but more particularly in some of the interventions, even those made from a seated position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that Labour hon. Members are only reflecting views expressed to them by trade union leaders and people in the trade union movement. [	<i>Hon. Members:</i> "No."] I do not say that disrespectfully. I see the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) shaking his head. I am sorry to see that, because I was giving him credit for having given the Committee some indication of the trade union movement's reaction to the clause. I believe that the reaction to the clause will be severe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the fact that the TUC will react strongly to a clause is sufficient reason for the Government to withdraw the clause. But if it is not proved that the clause will have some effect on the situation, I believe that that is sufficient reason for the Government to withdraw it. If the clause is only a cosmetic exercise, what is the point of upsetting the whole trade union movement and causing the friction that it will cause? If the clause will be effective, the Government can say "Be that as it may, we believe that the clause is right and we shall proceed with it". But if—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: the last few minutes the hon. Gentleman has been referring to what he and some people might describe as abuses of picketing. He has asked whether the clause as it stands will curb what he and others think of as abuses. But earlier in his speech the hon. Gentleman defended the right to picket peacefully, and persuade peacefully, and he said that people should have the right to do that anywhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the hon. Gentleman to reflect upon the fact that it was not my right hon. and hon. Friends and I who brought into the dialogue the question of flying pickets and the abuse of picketing. As I said in moving the amendment, the whole purpose of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1344</span>
amendments is to prevent the Government from denying people the right that the hon. Gentleman feels thay ought to have. The clause strips from many workers the right that the hon. Gentleman thinks they ought to have. The purpose of our amendments is merely to limit the extent to which workers are to be deprived of their rights. I hope that when the Committee divides on these amendments, we shall find the hon. Gentleman with us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot promise that the right hon. Gentleman will find me with him. However, I say with sincerity that I cannot tell him that he will not, either. That is why I press for the Attorney-General, or some member of the Government Front Bench, to give us an indication of the practicality of the clause. If the Government can convince me that the clause is effective, I make no secret of the fact that I shall vote with the Government. However, I doubt that it is effective. That is why I intervened at this stage, in the hope that in the wind-up speeches, or at some time, somebody might convince me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: here have been a number of cases already, which took place last winter or autumn, of secondary picketing which was unlawful. For instance, there was United Biscuits v. Fall of last winter, and this winter the Vauxhall cases to which I alluded in my earlier speech to the Committee. The courts upheld an injunction, and the picketing stopped. The case of United Biscuits v. Fall led on from the Express Newspapers v. MacShane judgment in the Court of Appeal. In the case of Vauxhall, it was trespass. But the truth is that in those cases the employer had to bring a civil action and the court's ruling was obeyed by the pickets. In both cases the organiser of the picket was the person named in the action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a rash person who said that every time there was a secondary picket an employer who was affected would take action. I do not believe that he would. It would also be a rash person who said that every time action was taken it was necessarily 100 per cent. effective. That would be asking too much. But there is no reason under civil law why an aggrieved employer should not bring an action, and there is no indication that under those circumstances he would not be able to name the organiser of the picket. There is no indication that the person named would not obey the law.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1224">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1345</span>
So I think that there is a very good chance that we could improve things far more than we are doing now, because the hon. Gentleman is making out a case for doing nothing if we cannot get this right. I think that we are moving towards getting it right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am graceful to the Secretary of State. Certainly that goes a little way along the road. After all, it is the Committee's job to push people to go a shade further and keep giving us a little bit more information. That is the sort of information I am after.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say in passing that the cases that the Secretary of State quoted were under existing law. The United Biscuits case was certainly under existing law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The case of United Biscuits v. Fall was undertaken as a result of the Court of Appeal judgment in Express Newspapers v. MacShane, which was overturned by the House of Lords. That is why it could not happen now. As the law is now, no action could be brought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that information also. As a non-lawyer—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a non-lawyer too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—and lone member of my party in the Committee, I find it difficult to follow such legal arguments. We follow them by pushing cases of this kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An injunction taken out by an employer against an individual during the run-up to a general election is not really, as my right hon. Friend said, a fair test of whether the law will be observed after the Bill has been passed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. I think that that is fair comment. As consideration of this clause proceeds, we must press more and more for indications of the Government's intentions and what they see happening under the clause before we can arrive at a conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am one of the members of the Committee who is looking forward—I say this without any disrespect to the Secretary of State—to the legal advice of the Attorney-General. Bearing in mind the trouble that the clause will cause, I want to be convinced that it is a trouble worth taking,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1346</span>
because the clause will be effective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Needham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can give an example to the hon. Gentleman which may help him a little. In last winter's dispute in a tyre factory near my constituency, there were many pickets. In such circumstances at present the employer and the employees who are being secondary-picketed are able to take action only through the police; they have to rely on the police to put matters right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this case the pickets went into the factory canteen to use it, which resulted in a punch-up in the canteen between one side and the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the purposes of the Bill, surely, is to bring some form of order where there is none. What seems to me to be very important is that at present the employer cannot, with the backing of his employees, bring a civil action to restrain people. If that had been possible in those circumstances I am certain—knowing that trade unionists and their organisers obey the law—that this problem would have stopped. Otherwise, it will not and we shall go on with the chaos that we have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention, but the hon. Member has more confidence than I have in the effectiveness of the clause. Perhaps time will prove who is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about civil law. That means, therefore, that we can exclude the police. There will be no help from the police in the enforcement of civil law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that it is on record that the chief constables have made it clear that they would not be prepared, under the clause, to ask for the names of people on picket lines. I am not objecting to their refusing to do so. I simply wonder whether any names will be obtained by the employer or somebody he employes. They will certainly not be obtained by the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for all those sorts of reasons that I have yet to be convinced. I want to do something about the abuse of picketing. It may be that this is all that we can do at present. But, bearing in mind the trouble that the clause will cause, before we complete the journey we must be sure that it is worth completing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will accept my intervening now. I thank the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) for his welcome

when I arrived. I am confident that the good will will be maintained for as long as I am on my feet, and afterwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal not only with the points that have been raised but with some that I know, as a result of communications from the Select Committee and from hon. Members speaking to me in the House, are in hon. Members' minds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to remember that in clause 14 we are giving back to employers rights that they used to have. When I listened with great interest to the skilful and inquiring speech of the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) it crossed my mind that it was, to some extent, the counsel of despair. It really amounted to an argument for doing nothing. I hope that by the end of the argument on these amendments he will be satisfied that there is a case for doing what we propose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal first with obstruction, because that came up in the course of interventions during the speech of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I was asked about it in the House on 19 February, when I made my statement. It may be helpful to the Committee if I deal with that and then go on to some other points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no question of section 15 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act providing immunity for obstruction which involves stopping lorries, linking arms or otherwise preventing access to a place of work. In other words, if there is any actual physical obstruction of someone who wants to enter a factory or office which is being picketed, section 15 affords no immunity from criminal prosecution. If, by contrast, all a person does is to stand on the pavement or on the side of the road, without interfering with the rights of others to pass and re-pass, and peacefully communicates information—perhaps by holding a placard or by speaking—or tries to persuade others not to enter their place of work, that does not amount to obstruction, even in the technical sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The obstruction that I referred to, which is of the most minor kind, in answer to a question from the hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon) during my statement, was where people doing their job perfectly peacefully prevent from moving along the pavement people who are trying not to get into the works but to their bus stop or the shops. The police officer is then entitled to ask them to move to another position
	<span class='label label-info column'>1348</span>
where they will not obstruct the ordinary use of the highway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a picket then refused to move he would be guilty of obstructing the police officer in the execution of his duty. But it would seem to be a very rare occasion. One finds ordinarily that the peaceful pickets, who are there for their proper job, do not cause that sort of obstruction, although they are standing still rather than moving up and down the highway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But if there were an obstruction under the Highways Act, where it was a lawful picket, it is open to argument that section 15 might provide immunity. Some say that section 15 is declaratory; others say that it would go further and provide an immunity in that case. But whatever the precise legal effect of section 15, its practical consequences are not in doubt. It confers no immunity from prosecution for obstruction in the sense in which that term is normally understood: that is, physically preventing a person from going where he wants to go, not only into the works, but also along the pavement to the other end of the road. If pickets go beyond peaceful persuasion and obstruct the passage of workers or vehicles, everyone knows that there is no protection for that sort of act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It follows that the limitation on the scope of lawful picketing proposed in clause 14 does not in any real terms extend the ambit of the criminal law. It does not create any new criminal offence and it does not affect the powers and duties of the police in any way. The fact that peaceful picketing at a person's home is now no longer expressly declared to be lawful does not mean that such picketing itself becomes a criminal offence. The same is true under clause 14 with regard to picketing other than at a person's own place of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Picketing confined to peaceful persuasion and argument is not, and never has been, a criminal offence. Clause 14 means simply that a person picketing outside the amended section 15 of the 1974 Act will no longer have immunity under section 13 from civil proceedings if he induces a breach of contract. I emphasise that because I think that there was a misunderstanding. Although it would be picketing to communicate, to say " Look, we are on strike in your sister factory round the corner", it would not be any breach of the law because it would not in itself be inducing any breach of commercial contract or a contract of employment. So the new clause will not make any real
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1226">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1349</span>
difference to the law on picketing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: fusion has been added to confusion. When I posed the question of the ship repair yard where vessels had been—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.40 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
	<p>6.55 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that we attempt to clear up the question that I raised with the Secretary of State during his speech. I suggested the not-so-hypothetical situation that could arise when a ship repair employer in dispute with his work force sent the ships under repair to another shipyard for repair. I asked him whether what the workers might well do in that case would come within the ambit of clause 14 and whether it would be illegal. He gave the impression that it would fall within the clause and would not be allowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, just before the Division bells rang, the Attorney-General indicated that it would be permissible for the workers in the first yard to travel to the second yard and, in effect, peacefully picket to indicate their views to the workers in the second yard. Will the Attorney-General clarify the position? It is important that we know precisely who is telling us what in regard to clause 14.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do every-thing that I can to assist the hon. Gentleman. For those in the empty yard to go to the yard to which the ships have been moved and tell their friends that the ships have been moved because of an industrial dispute would not give the employer any right at all. But if they then said " Look, these ships are blacked, come out and support us", it would give the employer a right, if he wanted, to take proceedings against them under clause 14.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it does not create any criminal offence. It is entirely a matter for the employer to decide. If two or three well respected trade union members were doing what he would expect them to do, and his own men listened and then said "No, we have these ships in our yard and we want to go on working", he would be a madman as an employer to try to start taking pro-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1350</span>
ceedings. But if the other workers were inducing his own men effectively to break their contracts of employment, and he felt that that would be very damaging to them and to the contract, it would be entirely up to him to decide whether to go to the courts to seek an injunction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, what the right hon. and learned Gentleman has just said amounts to this: picketing will be OK under the clause provided that it is unsuccessful, but if it is successful it will not do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be entirely up to the employers to decide whether to take action in the courts. It will be their choice and nobody else's. The picketing may be unsuccessful, but he may feel that the next day the picketing will be much heavier and he wants to stop that happening.

I appreciate that the Committee has borne in mind the consultative document during its discussions on the clause. But I must confine what I have to say to the clause. By tradition, Attorney-Generals do not go into hypothetical questions. They advise the Committee upon the law as put before the Committee for consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. and learned Friend said that it would be for the employer and no one else to take action. Do I understand that if someone else felt himself aggrieved he would not be able to take out an injunction?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Another employee, if he wished, would also be able to take steps. But one assumes that it would usually be the employer or the employer in co-operation with the employees who wanted to work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was hoping that the Attorney-General would enlarge on a matter with which he was dealing just before we went for the Division. On the question of the involvement of the criminal law, I understood him to say that nothing in clause 14 would in any way widen the liability to penalties under the criminal law, particularly with regard to obstruction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Am I right in saying that the present position is that people doing certain acts which would otherwise render them liable to penalties for obstruction are immune?
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1351</span>
If the conditions under which that immunity arises are changed and narrowed, people doing the same things in the future will become liable to penalties. Therefore, the liability to incur penalties for obstruction in the criminal sense will be increased as a result of reducing the circumstances within which people are allowed at present to create obstructions with immunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that I had made it clear, but I understand that it is complicated. The question is whether clause 14 is declaratory of the law as it was then or whether it provides that one little extra bit of protection in respect of the picket who is obstructing, for example, the housewife who wants to go into a shop. That is the only respect in which there can be any extension of the criminal law by the operation of clause 14.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been asked whether a picket who takes action which does not come within the scope of clause 14 could be arrested by the police. Let me confirm what I think everybody knows now: of course, that does not apply. Picketing which is not immune according to clause 14 is not, merely for that reason, an offence. There are many criminal offences which may be committed by pickets, and naturally pickets may be arrested, as may any other person, if they have broken the criminal law. But mere picketing outside clause 14 will not be a criminal offence. The remedy will lie with those who need to go to the court and say that they are being damaged by the picketing taking place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I clear up something that the right hon. and learned Gentleman has said about those who are entitled to take civil action? He said that the employer and the employee were entitled to do so. Are those the only two people who are entitled, or is anybody entitled? Can the person to whom the goods were destined to go, the supplier, the retailer or the customer take action?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That, again, will have to depend upon the working paper when it is published. As it stands at the moment, the one person primarily would be the employer, although there may be occasions when it would be the employee, usually, I suspect, working with the employer because they both want the factory to remain open. Principally anybody who is
	<span class='label label-info column'>1352</span>
a party to the contract is entitled. That would be the first test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I now deal with the effect of the forthcoming code of practice on picketing and the role and powers of the police—again in general terms, because it has not been finally fixed. It is a matter which has caused anxiety. The code has not been drawn up, and the responsibility for what is in it will lie' not with me but with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. Therefore, I cannot deal with it in any detail. But it is certain that it will be of assistance if it is anything like, for example, the code drawn up by the TUC. It will be of assistance to the police to the extent that it indicates the scope of peaceful picketing, although it cannot change the law on picketing. Another important object will be to provide guidance to those who organise picketing so that they may ensure that they keep within the law—the criminal law in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How far will clause 14 affect the responsibilities of the police? The advice given to the Select Committee by the police officers was absolutely right. It will not alter the responsibilities of the police to any significant extent. I should like to make clear that it is not the responsibility or the duty of the police to assist employers in enforcing any civil law remedies that they may have against pickets. That is a responsibility for the employers. I can see no way in which the police could properly be used by employers in seeking to enforce their civil remedies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the police cannot take names. But they might get involved. I gave a case in the Select Committee to Sir David McNee and he said that in that instance the police might be involved in criminal law, in obstruction, if a picket said that he was not from the place of work and he then refused to move after being asked to move by the police. The police would have to arrest him for obstruction, and then the criminal law would come in. So to that extent the criminal law would be more involved. The police agreed that that might happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for reminding me, because I had overlooked that. Let us say that there are some secondary pickets outside premises. It is no part of the job of the police to ask them whether they work there. It is no part of their job to ask
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1228">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1353</span>
them for their names. The only way in which the police will become involved is if the numbers or the way that they are placed are obstructing ordinary users of the highway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The police are then entitled—in fact, duty bound—to ask the pickets to move on, to get off the road so that ordinary cars can pass and ordinary housewives get on with their shopping. They ask them to go and stand somewhere else. They are not interested in their names or whether they work there, unless they refuse to obey the proper command of the police officer. They will then be asked their names and will be arrested for failing to obey the lawful order of the police officer. But it has nothing to do with the picketing aspect. The only connection between the picketing and the police is the fact that they were there, and if a criminal offence is committed the police step in because they have an obligation to keep the highway free.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to keep bothering my right hon. and learned Friend, but I think that there is another problem here and it relates to the employer—as has been explained, either at Grunwick or at Garners Steak Houses—if the police apprehend that the appearance of the employer on the picket line for any purpose may cause a breach of the peace. I am informed that in the case of Garners they have actually told the employer that he may not go out, and in the case of Grunwick the police commissioner confirmed that had one of the directors wished to go out to the picket lines there would clearly have been a breach of the peace and they would have had to restrain him from doing so. So the police would be involved in a negative sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be very surprised, unless the situation was extremely ugly and the police felt that if that happened it would spark off an affray or riot. Ordinarily, I do not think that the police would have any power to say to an employer or a representative of an employer that he could not go out and walk along and perhaps identify for himself which of his people were out there, or which other people were there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Extraordinary circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot be cross-examined. There may be extra-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1354</span>
ordinary circumstances where, simply by reason of the risk of a breach of the peace, that instruction would have to be given, because principally the police have the obligation to maintain the peace. That is one situation that one should always anticipate in every case, not only involving industrial relations but also football matches and other occasions when large numbers of people are gathered together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Attorney-General said something a few minutes ago which, if I heard correctly, rather disturbed me. He referred to a future code of practice on the police and picketing. We had understood—whether we agreed with it was another matter—that there was a likelihood of a code on picketing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meant to say a code of practice on picketing, not police and picketing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Attorney-General for that clarification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always very keen that the limited part that the police must play in this respect is made absolutely clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noticed, in the course of both the evidence before the Select Committee and in some of the articles and letters in the newspapers, that concern has been expressed about the lack of clarity relating to picketing. I should have hoped that my statement on 19 February had gone some way to clarify the situation. But I do not accept that there is really any lack of clarity, particularly concerning the criminal law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Offences that may be committed by pickets are part of the general criminal law, and we know that this is being kept under continuing review because of the answer of my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary in the House, when he said that that was going on all the time. I understand that a review has been commissioned of the statutes which deal with public order. But a general revision of the criminal statutes is no part of this Bill, and I hope that I gave sufficient assurance in my statement of 19 February that the existing law is sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also been asked—no doubt, it is a question in the minds of some members of the Committee—what procedure I would expect an employer to take to identify
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1229">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1355</span>
individual pickets against whom he wished to seek an injunction. We can go to the fanciful limits, as has been suggested—wearing masks and the rest. But one has to look at this from a practical point of view if it is to work. One of the things that those who organise pickets usually want is the maximum amount of publicity in order to further their cause, and I do not think that it will be treated as a very serious picket if they dress up in fancy gear, wearing silly masks. That will not be an effective way of going about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I imagine an employer will be looking for principally is the organisers who are in fact setting up the picket, organising it and maintaining it. There are various ways in which this can be done—identification by somebody who knows the organiser by sight or from photographs taken by a camera. In one case, a cinematograph film in a small camera was used and, indeed, based on the evidence of the film, injunctions were obtained from the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the sorts of ways in which an employer has to set about identifying individuals. There is no limit either to the ingenuity of the pickets or the subsequent ingenuity on the part of employers, but I do not think, from our experience of trade unionists, particularly those organising pickets, that they are backward in coming forward and making clear the part that they are playing in those pickets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one other matter which might be of help if I dealt with it. What does the employer do when he claims that he is suffering as the result of an unlawful secondary picket? First, as I say, he has to identify the organisers of the picket, or some of them. They must then be named in the proceedings that he would take in the High Court for an injunction. He would, of course, need evidence that his rights were being infringed by the unlawful pickets and that he had suffered or was likely to suffer as a result. He would have to swear an affidavit that secondary pickets were outside his factory and that they were sending back his lorries, preventing his employees getting in to work or seeking to do so. That application for an interlocutory injunction can be heard very quickly and, once it has been granted, it does not mean that only those people can be the subject of any subsequent order of the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If others work on behalf of the organisers—aid and abet them, assist them—knowing
	<span class='label label-info column'>1356</span>
that an injunction has been made preventing it, and they can be identified, they also can be taken before the court. I say this particularly for the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith), who was wondering what the remedies were. The remedies are fast and effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inevitably, one will be asked "What happens thereafter?" The court will say that they are to stop. If they want to be martyrs, the court will then, when they fail to stop and their breach of the injunction is proved to the court, have the remedy of fines open to it. It will only be, as I see it—certainly, as past experience has shown—where pickets have persistently refused to obey the orders of the court that imprisonment becomes a last resort. There would be fines in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly, it has been, I think, a proud tradition of the trade union movement that by and large it has not—certainly not the leaders of the unions—failed to obey court orders. There was a good example in the Duport case recently. Although Mr. Sirs was clearly advised that the decision of the Court of Appeal was wrong and would be taken to the Lords and was no doubt told confidently that he would succeed in the Lords, he responded at once to the order of the court and withdrew the instructions to the private steel workers to come out on strike. It is a proud tradition—which I hope will be maintained that, whatever arguments and rows there may be, when the High Court intervenes, the senior trade union officials respond to it.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman for giving way. I want to put a question to him. If I did not pose the question when he was present, and the situation arose later, I would feel that I had been remiss in carrying out my duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have examined the whole of this clause on picketing in relation to industrial affairs. We are concentrating on industrial affairs. But what will happen if—as happens quite frequently—a chemical plant, for instance, is causing offence to housewives in the surrounding area and they picket the establishment, in effect blockading it and stopping wagons and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1230">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1357</span>
lorries getting in and out? Will those people fall foul of clause 14?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One sometimes has some sympathy with such people and hopes that they will succeed. They could succeed here, because there would be no trade dispute which they could be acting in furtherance of. Nothing that they could do there would be picketing in furtherance of any trade dispute. One finds that when the ladies get to work in such circum- stances the reaction is quite often favourable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 14 could not be used against them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) raised the question of "place of work". It is left in that way deliberately because we have all learnt—I am sure that he will agree with me on this—that the courts can deal with the matter. The alternative is to define it, and bitter experience has taught me that to try to define leads to disaster or to—in the phrase used by the right hon. Gentleman in an intervention—a dog's breakfast. We shall end up with a dog's breakfast if we try to define every situation which would cover every work place—apart from the fact that it would be a huge clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am confident that the courts will have no difficulty in identifying a work place for themselves on the facts which are put there. If we try to define the work place we shall find ourselves in the most awful mess. My experience is that we never, when trying to define anything, manage to include every possibility. It is much better to leave it this way, so that the courts can deal with each case upon the facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have just been reminded—to return to my answer about the chemical works—that the ladies would have no protection against proceedings brought by the employer if he said that they were seeking to induce a breach of contract. If they were merely picketing the place to say "You are causing a fearful stink and all our laundry is getting dirty every Monday", but were not seeking to cause those working there to come out on strike or give up their jobs, they would not be committing any breach for which they could be sued.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If an injunction were taken out against someone to make him desist
	<span class='label label-info column'>1358</span>
from unlawful picketing, and he told the courts that he was under instruction from his union to picket and did not wish to desist because he was a member of a closed shop and was fearful that he might lose his card, he would be in a Catch 22 situation. He could obey either the courts or the union. Whichever he obeyed, he would be in difficulty. Would my right hon. and learned Friend care to comment on whether, in that situation, the courts would feel it necessary to join in the injunction a trade union itself?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would probably be the employer rather than the courts who would join the senior trade union official who had given those instructions, although I think that the court would be entitled to do so of its own motion. But the man whose situation my hon. Friend has described would still be subject to an injunction. If he had obeyed that injunction and refused to carry out trade union instructions, I cannot conceive of any circumstances in which he would not succeed in a later action in respect of losing his card because of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to pester the Attorney-General, but this is an opportunity to put a question to him. Can he comment on the position that I described, when the activity of an unlawful picket taints that of a lawful one? I am thinking of where there is a lawful picket of a head office by its workers. They are joined by pickets representing staff who do not work there but nonetheless belong to the firm. As I understand the matter, if the activities of the unlawful pickets resulted in a breach of contract, it would be possible, had there been some communication with the lawful pickets, to bring an action for conspiracy to commit an unlawful act against the lawful pickets as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Attorney-General feels that I have sprung the point on him perhaps he will reply at another time. However, I should be most grateful if he would clear the matter up, because it is an ambiguity that could open up a minefield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess that the matter has indeed been sprung on me to some extent although it is one that I considered some time ago. Section 13(4) is concerned with the tort of conspiracy. It provides that an act done by two or more people in contemplation or furtherance of a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I1231">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1359</span>
trade dispute should not be actionable in tort—for example, conspiracy—if that act would not have been actionable in tort without the agreement or combination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the removal of section 13(1) immunity means that secondary pickets are liable in tort for acts which induce breaches of contract. They therefore would lose the protection of section 13(4) if they combined together to induce a breach of contract. They are then combining to commit an unlawful act and are liable for civil conspiracy. In reality, whether in such circumstances the employer would take the steps to sue those people is impossible to judge. One would expect that he would not. But certainly the risk is there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and learned Gentleman passed rather glibly over the problem of defining "place of work". He told us that he would prefer not to do that because in his experience defining matters always led to disaster. But the Government have produced a considerable amount of legislation that all workers are expected to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether the Attorney-General agrees with his right hon. Friend for that most workers the term "place of work" has an obvious meaning, which is what we are told in the notes on the clause. If it has an obvious meaning to workers, why is it beyond the wit of the Attorney-General to define it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it not strange to expect workers to know what something means-indeed, the Secretary of State said that it was obvious to them—which is not obvious enough to the Attorney-General for him to put a definition in the Bill? He has told us that, far from even contemplating doing that, he knows that trying to define it would lead to disaster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are not the Government driving workers into a position of disaster by telling them "This is what you can do. We expect you to know what you cannot do, but we do not expect the Attorney-General to know it." That is not fair to the workers. When the right hon. and learned Gentleman says that he is happy to leave the matter to the courts, he implies that because workers will not know what the legislation means many cases will have to go to courts and thus a definition will be made by judges. Is that a satisfactory position in which to leave matters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1360</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It makes one wonder where the hon. Gentleman lives and where those of his constituents who work are employed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They work in the steel industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that everyone in the steel industry knows where his place of work is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In Rotherham, 11,000 people work in the steel industry in the public sector in Rotherham works of BSC. Their employer is the British Steel Corporation and their place of work is in Rotherham works. Half of Rotherham works is at Templeborough and Brinsworth on the Sheffield side of the town. The other part is four or five miles away at the Aldwarke, Roundwood and Thrybergh end of the works. That is now one works. The works used to belong to two separate private companies years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one asks a Rotherham steel worker where his place of work is, is it supposed to be Rotherham works of BSC? That is what most of them would say. Or is it Templeborough melting shop, Thrybergh bar mill or one of the other departments which are scattered over a considerable distance?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the right hon. and learned Gentleman that it is not as simple as he thinks. If he can tell me what is the place of work of those 11,000 Rotherham steel workers I shall be happy to convey that information to them so that they do not run foul of clause 14. But I do not think he can tell me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that when the steel worker constituents of the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a smart-alec answer which does not help the Committee at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a perfectly fair comment to make. They know where they are going to work in the morning when they get up. What the courts are most likely to ask when they are dealing with a picket outside his place of work is

where he last worked before he went on strike.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: am reluctant to detain the Committee at this hour, but while we have the benefit of the right hon. and learned Gentleman's advice we should take advantage of it. I wish to press him a little further on the question of the relationship between the code of practice which will eventually be produced and the criminal law. I know that he touched on I caught all he said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At an early stage in our proceedings, we drew attention to the fact that, unlike the codes of practice provided for in the Employment Protection Act 1975, which can be admissible in evidence before a tribunal or the Central Arbitration Committee, the codes of practice provided for under clause 2 can be admissible as evidence in a court. We hypothesised about the possibility of such a code carrying within it more stringent restrictions and additional provisions relating to picketing going beyond those in the body of the Bill, and we pointed out that, because they may be used in a court in proceedings relating to criminal activities, such a code might extend the criminal law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was the way in which we saw it,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1362</span>
and I have heard nothing from the Attorney-General to dissuade me from that view. It is quite possible for the Government to produce a code of practice on picketing that could be used in evidence in a court dealing with criminal matters, and that would be an extension of the criminal law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman will appreciate that I was not attending the Committee when clause 2 was dealt with. The wording dealing with the code—
	<br><blockquote><p>"admissible in evidence, and … any provision of the Code which appears to the court … to be relevant to any question arising … shall be taken into account "—</p></blockquote>
is almost identical to the words in the Road Traffic Act dealing with the Highway Code. But I assure the right hon. Gentleman that there is nothing in that code which makes an act a criminal offence which was not a criminal offence before the code was published.
