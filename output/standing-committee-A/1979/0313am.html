</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In presenting this series of amendments, may I stress once again what I said in the earlier debate on this clause, that what I might call the technical difficulties for women workers in under-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1156</span>
standing what is to happen in terms of maternity benefit in the future are made immeasurably worse by this Bill, and particularly by the complication of three possible notifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that, in making the decision to extend the notification requirements in that way, the Government have tossed aside the views of a whole range of independent bodies which have tendered advice. I do not think that anything that the Under-Secretary said when we debated the earlier amendment in any way undermined what I have just said. His presentation of the case was thoroughly inadequate, and we again return to the point that the evidence on which he bases these changes is virtually non-existent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Under-Secretary about the view of the Department of Employment's advisory council on the employment of women. I notice from the list of bodies which I received in answer to a parliamentary question that that body is listed as having both supported and objected to the proposals—obviously supported in some ways and objected in others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding of the overall position of that body, which is the Department's own advisory body-I used to chair it myself as Minister in the Department but it is now chaired, I believe, by the Minister of State—is that, although there may have been some point at which it felt able to support the Government, the overall conclusions of that body, the Department's own body set up for the specific purpose of advising on the employment of women, were—I know that it does not vote on these matters—that it was very much against the proposals in this clause. So it is rather misleading to list that body as in any way in support. No doubt, the Under-Secretary will be able to clarify that in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me deal first with amendment No. 137 which, I think, is self-explanatory. We are seeking here an additional safeguard against some legal action taken against her as a consequence if a woman ultimately decides that she cannot go back even after a written notification. We have already discussed all the problems that can arise in the early months after childbirth, and it would be extremely undesirable if a letter which she had written during that period could in any way be held against her.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary has already given some kind of assurance on that, but we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1123">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1157</span>
seek to write it into the legislation so that it will be made clear to her by her employer that she is not giving some legally binding undertaking that could be held against her, come what may.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In amendment No. 143, we have in mind that an employer may want to dodge his responsibility simply by saying that he wrote to the employee and had no response. It is difficult to be precise about the way in which that matter could be taken care of, but probably the simplest way would be by a registered letter. Perhaps the Government themselves—here I want to do a little probing—could offer some other safeguard. In other words, we want some evidence that the employer has done what is required. I suggest that the best way might be by registered letter, though the Government may have thoughts of their own. It is not good enough to leave it as provided in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to next amendment No. 138. The Bill provides for an additional notification by the employee if the employer requests it. That means that women whose employers want to exercise that right can lose their entitlement to the right to return to work at three different stages: before they take maternity leave if they do not comply with the notification requirements, after the birth of the baby if they do not respond within the specified time to the employer's request, and 21 days before returning to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to ensure that the employer who exercises the option of second notification lets the employee know about the danger of not replying, and does so in such a way that the woman will understand that non-compliance will result in the loss of her right to return to work. The Under-Secretary has hinted that he may be sympathetic towards this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are saying that the prescribed form of notice should flow from consultation with both ACAS and the EOC. They should be able to express a view, so that we may ensure that the form of words—or the form itself, if it is to be a prescribed form—is easily understandable. Otherwise, there is a danger that an employer could phrase the information by reference to sections of the Act instead of to the actual rights contained in them. That would be decidely confusing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not say that many employers would seek to do that, but there could be deliberate
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1158</span>
evasive action. We have to remember also that many of the women about whom we are concerned are immigrants with a language problem, and we are talking about immigrant employers, too. So there is need for simplicity—for things to be spelt out clearly and simply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also ensure that the employer's letter does not in any way imply a discouragement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this set of amendments I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman a simple question. Why do we need these three notifications? It will mean—I am sure that he will not seek to deny it—extra red tape, extra paper work, extra bureaucracy and extra irritation for everybody concerned. So I hope that he will feel able on this occasion to accept, if not all the amendments, some of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All of them, we hope. Certainly, we should like to know what additional safeguards he feels can now be built into the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) for the way in which he has presented the amendments, and I gladly respond to the general question with which he concluded his speech. Why do we need these notifications, and what is the purpose of the changes for which the clause provides? I can answer that shortly by repeating what I said at our last sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, there is too wide a gap between the two dates in relation to a woman's confinement at which she is required to give an intimation of her intention to claim the right to be reinstated. The first date falls at II weeks before her confinement and the second falls one week before the date at which she intends to return, and that, as we know, may be 29 weeks after the confinement. We believe that to be much too wide a gap to be consistent with the ability of employers to plan ahead, either to know on what basis to recruit a replacement in the absence of the woman or to be able to fill on a permanent basis a gap which may have been kept open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the argument centres on the intermediate notification that can be requested by the employer at a date not earlier than seven weeks after the confine-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1124">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1159</span>
ment, when he may ask in writing for confirmation. He will say "You said just before you started your maternity leave that you wanted to come back later. Now you have had the baby and a reasonable time has gone by"—not less than seven weeks, and he may be asking for this confirmation of intention a good deal later. "Now we want you, please, to confirm what you earlier said—or not, as the case may be because it will help us to know how to proceed."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems to us to be a perfectly reasonable change to enable planning to be carried out more reliably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the amendments in the order in which they have been selected. Amendment No. 138 has the effect of bringing to the notice of the employee concerned the importance of giving notice of her intention to return to work after confinement within 14 days of receipt of the employer's request and of warning her of the consequences of the failure to do so—the loss of right to return. We are talking here about the intermediate notice that I have just mentioned. He can ask in writing for confirmation that she still intends to come back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have considerable sympathy with the amendment and what lies behind it. What is being said is that the employer can ask for written confirmation and, if it is not given, subsequently the woman will not be entitled to reinstatement under the provisions of the statute. I follow what lies behind the amendment. I think that it could be said that, by doing this, the employer might appear subsequently to have created, although not intentionally, a kind of trap. If there is no notification to the woman of the adverse consequences of not complying and not giving notice, she might well feel that it was unjust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I am prepared to accept that amendment in principle, because it meets the justice of the case. The difficulty is that I cannot accept it on the present drafting, but we acknowledge that it is right that a request of this nature should carry with it some notification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman give an indication of what was wrong with the form of words?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept it in principle, and I do not wish to be bound at this juncture
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1160</span>
to the precise wording that will find its way into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 137 would allow for the employee to be advised that although she gave confirmation in writing of her intention to work, there could be no liability on her part if she did not in fact do so. Not only does it allow for it, it requires it because the amendment says in subsection (3C):
	<br><blockquote><p>"The immunity from action contained in (3B) above shall be clearly stated in any written request issued by the employer under (3A)."</p></blockquote>
The difficulty can be put as follows. It may or may not happen, but I believe that it would be an extremely rare case where any employer would wish to hold a woman employee in these circumstances to a representation that she had made in response to his request for confirmation of her intention to come back. It would be so rare as to be virtually non-existent. But in law it is at least far from plain that a representation as to a future course of conduct cannot be relied upon. Be that as it may, it is one thing, and perfectly proper, for an employer to say "If you do not reply to this and give us the confirmation we are asking for, then you will lose your rights", but quite another to require him to go on at the same time and say "But you need not really mind much what you do say, because you are not going to be held to it". That is going too far, and I shall try to explain why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object here is to try to get a reasonably reliable statement of intention. The purpose is to enable planning to proceed, as much in the interests of somebody who has been taken on as a replacement temporarily for somebody who is away in order to have a child as for other reasons. We tend not to take into account the interests of those who have been temporarily recruited on the understanding that they will have to give up the job when the woman who has gone away to have her child comes back. They have an interest in knowing what the future will be, and so does the employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the reason for this amendment, which would require the employer to say "You are on risk if you do not reply to this", but to make him go on and say "You need not pay much attention to what you say" goes much too far. Although I do not say that there will be many who fall into this category, I think that there will be some who say to themselves "There is nothing to lose. Let's say we will come
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1125">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1161</span>
back. Here, the notice actually says so." It will have the effect of diminishing the reliability, and hence the value, of the information that is given. That is the whole purpose. So, although I sympathise and would like to do so here, too, I am not able to show the same co-operative response to this amendment that I did to the previous one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept what the hon. and learned Gentleman says, but I wonder whether his point is met, to some extent at any rate, if subsection (3B) in the amendment stands and subsection (3C) does not. Although that would not be my desired objective, it would meet the hon. and learned Gentleman's view. It would mean, as I see it, that the liability would not be there, but it would not be stressed when the employee was advised by the employer. That seemed to be the point that particularly bothered the hon. and learned Gentleman. Is there the possibility of a compromise on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the suggestion, but I am not attracted by it because it is so often a mistake to legislate in a specific instance to derogate from broad principles of law. One should look at the reality of the situation and ask whether the chances of an employer seeking to hold a woman to a representation that she would come back when in fact she did not, and to pursue her in the courts for damages, are sufficiently real to justify a special derogation from a broad principle of law. Frankly, they are so remote as to be virtually out of sight and therefore not to justify it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter of judgment. I have expressed my view on subsection (3B) as distinct from subsection (3C) in that way. I do not think that the practical likelihood of this mischief resulting is so great as to justify the course that is proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of amendment No. 142 falls into two parts. The first part merely reflects what we have already discussed on amendment No. 138, that the written request from the employer should contain the information warning a woman of her loss of right to return if she fails to comply with the request. To that extent, the amendment is acceptable, but that only flows from what I have already said on amendment No. 138.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part requires that a pre-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1162</span>
scribed form shall be used and that the Government shall consult with ACAS and the EOC before the form is produced. Here, I am afraid, I cannot be co-operative because, whereas we agree that this information ought properly to be given, we are anxious so far as possible to avoid requiring businesses—and especially small businesses—to use particular forms and to be held to a particular form of words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel that that would add to the bureaucracy—we have used the word rather loosely and inaccurately—inherent in this legislation, and we think it important to stick to the main point, that the employee should be told clearly and accurately. It does not matter whether a particular form of words is used so long as that objective is achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not, therefore, wish to make employers use a particular form. It can be put as simply as that. We think that it will be for them to make sure that they convey the information accurately. If they do not, and if it is found subsequently on any issue before the industrial tribunal that they have not adequately complied with this part of the Bill, that will be their funeral, not the employee's. So the burden will be upon them to convey the information accurately, but to achieve that purpose we do not think that a particular form of words is necessary, let alone one produced by the Government after consultation with ACAS, the EOC or anyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 143 would allow employees to retain their rights to return to work after pregnancy or confinement, notwithstanding the request from their employer for confirmation of intention to return and the fact that they had not complied with that request, if it could not be proved that the employees received the written request. The wording is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3C) The provisions of subsection (3) above shall not apply unless the employer can produce evidence that the employee had received the written request."</p></blockquote>
Here again, I entirely understand what lies behind the amendment, and, of course, I sympathise with it. But my advice to the Committee is that it is not necessary. The provision as it stands reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where not earlier than forty-nine days after the beginning of the expected week of confinement … an employee is requested in writing by her employer or a successor of his to give him written confirmation…".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1126">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1163</span>
The phrase "requested in writing" is the key. What does that mean? Clearly, it means more than writing out a request and leaving it on one's desk. It has to be communicated. It has to be sent. One is not requested in writing unless the request is made out and sent. The burden lies on the employer to show that the request has been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is something which courts and tribunals have to deal with as a question of fact every day of the week. If a person is giving notice that he wants possession of his house, or of half a dozen other everyday things of which notice has to be given under the law, the burden lies upon him to show on the balance of the probabilities, in the court or in the tribunal, that he has given notice and that that notice has been received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the clause, a woman might say "I claim my rights to be reinstated and they have been contested by the employer. He is not taking me back. He says that the reason is that he sent the seven-week notice and I did not comply with it. I did not give him confirmation. But I have to tell the tribunal that I never received the request." It then becomes a matter of fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The burden of proving on the balance of the probabilities that the request was made and communicated rests upon the employer. There are a number of ways in which he can meet it. At one extreme, he could say that he had used the recorded delivery procedure and produce the receipt and the signature. It would then be very hard for a tribunal to avoid finding that the request had been communicated. The employer could use the registered post, or he could simply say that he had given her in his office a written request, of which he had kept a copy, and then call a witness to corroborate that. There are many ways in which this evidence can be given. But it is not necessary to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The provisions of subsection (3) above shall not apply unless the employer can produce evidence that the employee had received the written request."</p></blockquote>
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not criticising in a tendentious or factious way the actual drafting, but the matter does not depend upon just producing evidence. It depends on the evidence being accepted, and that, as I have tried to show, is part of the law already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is this difficulty, It is not only unnecessary but if we legislate in this way
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1164</span>
by doubly emphasising the point, so to speak, we run into the old problem of the implications that may arise and the inferences that may be drawn in respect of other areas of our legislation that require notice to be given where the same emphasis is not applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What inferences would be drawn as to Parliament's intention? I believe that it would open up questions which have long been settled and create uncertainty where hitherto there has been a reasonable degree of certainty. My advice to the Committee is that the amendment is not necessary, that the burden rightly rests upon the employer in this context, and that it is adequately so expressed in the clause. I hope that it will therefore be seen that it is not for any lack of sympathy with the motive lying behind the amendment that I cannot advise my hon. Friends to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Giles Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to clear my own mind on the hon. and learned Gentleman's reasoning on the amendments. When asked the general question about the reason for the additional notifications, as I understand the matter—he will correct me if I am wrong—the Minister said that there is now too wide a gap between the two dates, first, the date of notification before confinement, and second, the notification before the return. Am I correct in that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that is the argument. That is the case, therefore, for this additional new notification—that the employer now has a new right to demand that the employee notifies that she will return 49 days after the expected confinement—is that so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not less than 49 days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand—she must notify not less than 49 days after confinement. According to the Government, this will lead to greater certainty for employers and will help the temporary replacements. But is that actually so? I should have thought that six weeks after confinement is early for a woman to be certain of what she intends to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Seven weeks, and she has a fortnight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1165</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All right. But is not this rather early? f the confinement was a difficult one, it is likely that the woman concerned might say "Yes, I shall return" when in fact she was not returning. This will not lead to any greater certainty for employers. I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) made that comment in respect of a previous amendment, last Tuesday, I believe. It was the Minister who raised the matter this morning, which is why I am trying to follow it up. I am trying to explore his thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am somewhat confused here, because if the provision will not lead to any greater certainty for employers, what is the purpose of it? As my hon. Friend remarked, it will lead to much more red tape, which small employers do not like. There is also the problem that it could lead to a diminution of rights. As the Minister knows, the Low Pay Unit has described the Government's changes in total as leading to a situation in which we have the worst package in respect of maternity rights in the EEC following the amendments which the Government are making to the Employment Protection Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any case, there is not enough knowledge of maternity rights by employers—the ORC survey showed that—or by employees of what their rights are. This new series of notifications will add to the confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman may say, as he usually does when pressed on this kind of issue, that this is a minor but useful change. That has been his great rallying cry to the Conservative Party throughout our proceedings. If it really is so minor, why bother to change? Why bother to create this additional uncertainty? Why bother to create the additional red tape? If it is not minor but is a major and important change, let us have the evidence to justify it. That is the weakness of the hon. and learned Gentleman's case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a simple and short question for the hon. and learned Gentleman. He has told us that notice given means not merely notice sent. One understands that. The word "given" implies an act of handing over, an act of receiving as well as an act of giving. Therefore, one can see the point of his saying that giving notice means that there has to be receipt on the part of the woman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1166</span>
What I do not understand is his authority for saying that the tribunal will always hold that the burden of proof is on the employer. Where in the clause are there any words out of which it will follow that a tribunal will find guidance that it must put the burden of proof on the employer? I see no such words, and, although we always listen with avid interest and deepest respect to the words of the hon. and learned Gentleman, we have no guarantee that his words will be held in the same sort of regard by some tribunal sitting in 1986 or 1987.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: t would be different if he was Lord Chancellor, perhaps.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So my question is simple. Where are there words in the clause which give justification for the assumption that a tribunal will always put the burden of proof on the employer? It was entirely on that argument that the hon. and learned Gentleman rested. I thought that there was a substantial case for what he was saying if we may assume that the burden of proof would be put on the employer. He rested on that, and he must give us some sort of feeling of security that the platform on which he is resting will not collapse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will not think me ungrateful for his helpful response to amendment No. 138, or that I am indifferent to the case for amendments Nos. 142 and 143, if I ask him to turn his attention back to No. 137. I wish to press him somewhat more on this amendment, and I do so because this was a matter to which I made specific reference on Second Reading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Perhaps the Under-Secretary will tell us what will happen in the case of women who have declared in writing as they will be required to do, their intention to return to work after their confinement and yet fail to do so. Without a clear statement from him, the obvious response of women in those circumstances will be for all of them, whether they sincerely intend to do so or not, to declare their intention to return to work, merely to safeguard themselves."</p></blockquote>
I went on to say that there was not sufficient time then in the House to deal adequately with these matters, and said
	<br><blockquote><p>"I warn the Government that each will be analysed and criticised, and many of them will be vigorously opposed in Committee."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1128">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1167</span>
That is exactly the point that we have reached now. The Under-Secretary was good enough to reply on that specific matter in these terms:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I was asked what would happen if a woman gave her notice but did not return. The answer is exactly what would happen at present—nothing." —[	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 December 1979; Vol. 976, c. 152–164.]</p></blockquote>
The statement made by the hon. and learned Gentleman in the House will doubtless be more widely reported than are our proceedings in this Committee. The world seems to be little aware of what is going on here, but was very interested in the Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All we are asking is that the hon. and learned Gentleman will put his words on Second Reading into the Bill. What we have from him now is a retreat. He is resiling. He says that there may now be some cases. He made no qualification when the matter was before the House. He said categorically that nothing would happen. Now we have qualifications—it will be rare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we are already seeing a weakening of what the hon. and learned Gentleman said. What does he mean by "rare"? Does he mean that there will still be the opportunity for each and every employer to say, on the strength of what he has said this morning, "And I may have a case against you if you tell me that you will come back and do not"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If what the hon. and learned Gentleman says is correct, that such cases would be rare—which is different from what he said on Second Reading—the Government ought to give the benefit of any balance of doubt to all those women who may subsequently be faced with anxiety if they give an undertaking without being absolutely sure in their own hearts that they will be able to return, being unaware of what their physical condition may be, whether they have been able to make child-minding arrangements, and so on. All these matters will confront the woman at the time she has to make this difficult decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to remove the anxiety, in view of the assurance given by the hon. and learned Gentleman on Second Reading, I think that it is worthwhile the Government doing that even if it may disadvantage the employer in the rare hypothetical circumstance suggested by the hon. and learned Gentleman. In order to relieve all
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1168</span>
the other women of anxiety, the Government ought to be prepared to take that opportunity for action away from the individual employer—that is, if the hon. and learned Gentleman is right about the cases being rare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman rested on another legalistic argument, which, if it was understood by the Committee, I am sure would not be understood by the women whose futures are bound up with what we are discussing. He spoke about derogation from legal principles. I am a simple ex shop steward. I do not understand all these principles and derogations from principles of the law. I am concerned about the rights of people in industry and the well-being of working people. They will not be impressed by talk of derogation from principles of law. They will want to know whether they will be able to return to work or whether, if they say that they will return to work and find that they cannot, they will be exposed to legal proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also have a couple of questions to put. As my hon. Friend the Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Radice) said, the hon. and learned Gentleman often justifies what he is doing as something small and minor. I put to him that this is a particularly minor matter because so few women are involved; there are so few cases of women claiming these rights and their claiming of their rights causes no problems to British industry. Therefore the whole thing is unnecessary. We do not need it at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a dispute is caused, it will be dealt with by a tribunal. I put to the hon. and learned Gentleman the case of a young woman with a baby of just seven or nine weeks—she could be a member of a single-parent family with her baby as young as that—pursuing her employer before the tribunal. Does he find that palatable? I do not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will not find it at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Madel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It cannot happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I clear it up, Mr. Leadbitter? It cannot happen at all. Nor is it what is required. What is enabled—not required—under the provision is that not less than seven weeks after the date of confinement the employer may ask the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1129">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1169</span>
woman in writing for confirmation of her intention to come back. She has a fortnight after receipt of that request within which to comply or not to comply with it. No one is saying that she must come with a baby under her arm at seven weeks or anything like that. She is entitled to remain away from work for 29 weeks after the confinement. f she then wishes to come back she must show that three weeks before the twenty-ninth week she said that she was coming back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are talking about is the intermediate provision for a request by the employer for confirmation that the woman really meant it—and still means it—when she said before she went away for her maternity leave that she wanted to come back at the end of it all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: f I understand aright, the young woman, when the baby is nine weeks—it may be her first baby—must make up her mind. Let us suppose that, because of the various problems involved, she does not make up her mind. To obtain her rights, she would have to appear before a tribunal with a baby aged 29 weeks. So I re-pose the question. Are we happy with the thought of a young woman with a sixmonth-old baby having to pursue her employer before the tribunal or disputing her case before a tribunal?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it necessary to create this situation? Let us look at the experience of other countries and of the rest of the EEC. What qualifying conditions are there in Belgium for reinstatement? None. They are found to be completely unnecessary. In Denmark, none. The Danes get by quite happily without any of this. In France, none. In Germany, the person must advise the employer at least four weeks before leave begins of her intention to return to work. In Ireland, none. The talians get by quite well without any of these provisions. In Luxembourg there are no conditions. In the Netherlands there are no conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How do all those other European countries, with the single exception of Germany, manage to get by quite happily without any problems? Why are we putting these rather onerous conditions on a young woman who has recently had a baby? The only argument that I have heard is that of the temporary. But the hon. and learned Gentleman will accept that many people prefer to work on a temporary basis. They do not want permanent employment and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1170</span>
therefore they work via agencies. If they choose to work in that way, that is no problem. That is their free choice. The whole thing is completely unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I deal first with the question raised by the hon. Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Radice). Why do we need these extra notifications? The question goes over pretty well beaten ground. He was perfectly right when he recited the answers that I had given yesterday and today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the existing law, a woman has to give a first notification of intention three weeks before the beginning of the period in which she goes off before having the baby—that is, three weeks before the beginning of the eleventh week before the expected confinement. Under the existing law, another 28 weeks after the confinement can go by before, if reinstatement rights are to be claimed, another notice has to be given if there is an intention to return. This is an enormously long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that we have the worst package in the EEC on maternity rights, and the point was taken up by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton). That is not right. One has to look at the package as a whole, and the position is this. We have the longest period of maternity leave of any European country. A woman can stay away after her confinement for much longer in this country—29 weeks—than is normal in the rest of Europe. The provisions relating to the right to return after maternity absence in other EEC member States fall a long way short of those enjoyed in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the information available to us at the moment, only Western Germany allows almost as long a period of post-natal leave as we do. This consists of eight weeks, plus an additional four months. But the woman must apply for the additional leave within one month of the birth of the baby, she has four weeks to make up her mind. The hon. Member for Newham, North-East must bear that in mind. He will see that that is really a much tougher provision. Within four weeks of the birth of the baby the woman has got to make up her mind whether she will apply for the additional four months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rest of the EEC member States, although several of them make provision for re-engagement of workers in this category, keep the original job open for a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1130">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1171</span>
much shorter period, with six or eight weeks being common—not 29.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, at roughly the time we are expecting our women to confirm their intention to return, and only if asked to do so, many other members of the EEC are expecting their women to be back at work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman disagrees with the contention that we have a worse package than the other EEC countries. Previously, he prayed in aid of the Low Pay Unit, which said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The maternity provisions need to be seen in the context of other European countries. Although the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act established improved maternity rights for women in the UK the provisions are still much less generous"</p></blockquote>
than in the other EEC countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One issue in particular deserves mention. In all the other EEC countries where there is a statutory right to maternity leave there is no qualifying period. In the United Kingdom a woman must have been employed by her employer for two years to qualify for either maternity pay or maternity leave. That is another example where we are worse off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. and learned Gentleman on his point about Germany. My case there is that it is only in Germany. There are no qualifying conditions in all the other countries, and therefore I think we have sustained our case that the package of maternity provisions is less generous in the United Kingdom than in the other European countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The longer the period of post-natal leave, the greater the difficulty for an employer in planning unless he has means of confirming that his employee really does want to come back. We have a much longer period of postnatal leave than other European countries, as I have just indicated. Apart from Germany, where the extra four months have to be applied for after eight weeks and that application has to be made within four weeks of the confinement, in other European countries the woman must go back to work within six to eight weeks. That is the norm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that case there is much less need for intermediate notification, or indeed any notification, than there is if the woman is to go on for 29 weeks, which is over half a year. That is the distinction. If we are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1172</span>
looking at questions of the welfare of women who have gone away from work to have their babies, what matters is the length of time that they are allowed to stay away from work after confinement to get used to looking after a baby and so on before they have to return to work if they want to take up their reinstatement entitlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do extremely well in this respect, but the corollary is that it is fair to enable an employer to say "After a minimum of seven weeks, I am now entitled to ask you, please, to confirm whether you want to come back, and to give you a fortnight to think about it". That is how it is put, and that is the answer to the question of the EEC package. If hon. Members look at the matter as a whole, they will see that women do much better here in terms of post-natal leave duration, and that is the justification for having a requirement for intermediate notice, which, I agree, does not exist in other European countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman says "other European countries", and I noticed that he said it several times in his remarks. In between those references to "other European countries" the Minister talked about the EEC package.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to rest arguments on international comparisons, may I take the liberty of reminding the hon. and learned Gentleman that the EEC is not the whole of Europe? From what he said, I assume that overnight there have disappeared from his atlas such countries as Austria, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Poland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—Poland, not to mention a few others. If we are to talk about other European countries, we had better talk about all of them, because they are all still in my atlas even if they are not in the Minister's atlas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman ought to direct that criticism to his lion. Friend the Member for Chester-le-Street, to whose intervention I was seeking to reply. The note I made of what the hon. Member for Chester-le-Street said was that we have the worst package in the EEC, and I have therefore been trying to survey what happens in the rest of the EEC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1131">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman did for part of the time, and then he went on to the EEC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree, all right—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I must persist now. I have been a bit too goodhearted in giving way the whole time and I was therefore not able to make my point. If the hon. Gentleman persists, I will give way to him in a few moments. But that should not be regarded as a request for confirmation of his intention to intervene; nor does it confer any right upon him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) asked where in the clause are there any words which place the burden of proof upon the employer to show that the notice was received. The answer is that there are no words in those terms. It is seldom that there are express words to say where the burden of proof lies. In any legislation which imposes a duty or makes it necessary to show that a certain fact exists, the burden of proof lies upon the person who has to show that fact, namely, upon the person who alleges it. Here it is the employer who alleges that he requested the employee in writing to give confirmation. Unless he alleges that, he cannot escape the obligation to reinstate her at the end of 29 weeks, that is what the issue is about. It is giving a means of avoiding the obligation to reinstate. What is the means? The means is by saying "Not earlier than seven weeks after confinement, I wrote to her and asked her to confirm her intention to come back. I requested her in writing". The employer therefore has to allege that, and under the basic principles of our law, which do not have to be spelt out expressly in every statutory provision, it is for him to prove it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The burden of proof is on the employer. What is the standard of proof? It is the balance of the probabilities. He has to show, in the opinion of a tribunal, that it is more likely than not that he is right. That is the basic law of our country in civil matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely understand why the hon. Gentleman asks me that question. I hope that he will accept from me that the burdon of proof is placed absolutely plainly upon the employer to show that he did request and, therefore, as the hon. Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1174</span>
acknowledged, that the request was communicated, and it is a question of fact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me tell the hon. and learned Gentleman the point that worries me and perhaps he can help me with it. I am grateful for the clarification which he has just given. The situation that worries me is that the employer is before the tribunal and he says "On 19 January I sent Mrs. So-and-so this letter and I have a copy of it here." Mrs. So-and-so says "I did not receive it." Is not the tribunal obliged to make a judgment about the relative credibility of the witnesses? Surely, it means that the burden of proof is not on either side.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The burden of proof is upon the employer there to show that the request was communicated. He will start, of course, by saying that he posted it. If the employee says that she never received it, the tribunal then has a question of fact on its hands. It has to decide on all the circumstances. Today the post is not quite the infallible institution that we used to expect it to be. The hon. Gentleman is perfectly right. It is a question that the tribunal has to take into account as to whether somebody seems to be telling the truth or not. It is a matter for the tribunal to decide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is something to which tribunals are well used. They have to do it every day of the week. That is why they are there. It is possible for the burden of proof to shift and it would shift in this way. If the employer were to produce, under the recorded delivery procedure, a receipt which appeared to be signed by the employee, the burden of getting round that one, which is called the evidential burden, would shift to the woman. She would have to say "I see what you say, but that is not my signature."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These things look pretty desperate sometimes if one summons up an abstract case, but the general burden of proof is always upon the employer, and tribunals, just like magistrates, who are drawn from the ranks of all of us and are experienced and sensible people, have to make their minds up. At the end of the day, they will ask themselves whether they are satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the request was actually received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may be permitted an aside from my own experience and common sense, no
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1132">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1175</span>
tribunal will be anxious to do a woman out of her rights to reinstatement and, if there is a reasonable doubt, a tribunal in practice will say that it is not satisfied that it was received. But the burden of proof does not have to be spelt out in the legislation in the way suggested in the amendment for the tribunal to be empowered to take that view. It rests upon the employer to show that it was received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can think of an almost infinite variety and combination of circumstances where that issue may arise. I have tried to give a couple of extremes—the recorded delivery with the receipt, at one end, and at the other end, perhaps, the chap saying that he posted it second class and he cannot quite remember what day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that I am right in saying that it is unnecessary to have the amendment, and it is harmful in the sense that it gives rise to the inferences and implications elsewhere in the statute book, and even in the Bill, that I mentioned earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newham, North-East was under a misapprehension—which I hope that I have cleared up—when he said that we were requiring a woman to come to the tribunal a mere seven or nine weeks after the birth of her child. She is not required to come to the tribunal at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about a woman who gave her preliminary notice before the birth, gave her notice three weeks—as it will be under the Bill—before the date when she intended to come back, who comes back, and finds that there is no job. She says that she wants her job back, that she is entitled to it. Her employer says, "No, you are not. I sent you a notice not less than seven weeks after the birth of your baby, a request asking you to confirm that you wanted to come back, and you did not reply." That is the sort of situation. The woman would then go to the tribunal and say that she had been unfairly dismissed because she had been denied her reinstatement rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue would then be whether or not she received that intermediate request. There is no question of her having to go to the tribunal at seven weeks or nine weeks with the baby under her arm. We are talking about the question that would arise in the circumstances I have just set out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We return to the point raised by the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow about the burden of proof. I repeat that the burden of proving it would be upon the employer
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1176</span>
to show not only that he had made a request in writing, not only that he had sent it to the woman, but that it had been received. All that is implicit in our law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) concentrated upon amendment No. 137. He reminded me of what I had said on Second Reading in answer to one of his questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I do not have the 	<i>Hansard</i> before me, I accept that he accurately recited my reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the benefit of more considered advice, I must say that it cannot be stated categorically that no employee giving notice under the new provisions or under the 1978 Act who subsequently failed to return would ever be liable in tort. It cannot be said categorically as a matter of law that she would never be liable. There is a chance that on certain circumscribed occasions an employer could have a theoretical claim in his own behalf for negligent misrepresentation by his employee. But we are not aware of any case where that has ever arisen, and I am quite aure that I am right in saying that in practice it will not happen. Who will pursue a woman for damages in those circumstances?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the benefit of advice, I cannot say that the law as it stands would not provide a theoretical claim and, to that extent, my immediate reply to the right hon. Member for Doncaster on Second Reading was not wholly accurate. But so far as practicalities are concerned I stand by it and believe that it was as a matter of practicality and common sense correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman says that he is a simple ex shop steward and that he does not understand these matters of law. As an ex Minister, he has, I think, been responsible for more labour law than any other Minister this century. That is the practicality of it, and I go back to what I said. Generally speaking, it is bad practice to take away from a general principle of law and order to meet a special factual case or circumstances unless one is really satisfied that that factual case or circumstance is so likely to arise as to create a real need for it. In my view, that does not exist.

I was asked by the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) what was the advice of the advisory council on the employment of women on these provisions. As the hon. Gentleman said, the committee met under the chairmanship of my noble Friend the Minister of State to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1133">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1177</span>
discuss the proposals in the Government's working papers. The committee, consisting of representatives of employers, employees and women's interests, expressed a wide range of views on the proposals. I shall just deal With their views on the additional notification at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employers' representatives stressed the need for more reliable information than at present, and there was a considerable amount of sympathy for this. The view was expressed that it should be up to the employer to make the request for additional notification, and we have taken this suggestion into account in the Bill. The committee comprises representatives of employers and employees. The view that I have mentioned was expressed by representatives of employers and, I understand, by some representatives of employees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to say a few brief words on the amendments, but first of all, I return to the three notifications. In his earlier remarks, the hon. and learned Gentleman said that he thought that this would provide a more reliable guide for employers of the intentions of their employees on maternity leave. I think that is probably one of the most fallacious arguments that he has advanced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that what will happen is that two classes of employee will be created. There will be, on the one hand, those women on maternity leave who understand the new and more complicated law. That group of women, whatever their ultimate intention, will safeguard their position by writing back to say that they intend to resume their employment. They will take that kind of safeguard on board. I should not blame them; indeed, I should encourage them to do so. I should say "Do not blame me, and do not blame your employer. Blame the stupid Government for putting you in that sort of position." I think that as a consequence there will be an increase in the number of women declaring their intention to return and probably no rise at all in the actual numbers who do return.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: More uncertainty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: More uncertainty, indeed. The other class of women—and this is serious—will be those who simply do not understand these new complications and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1178</span>
complexities. I have already mentioned in particular the immigrant labour force. Many women will be involved in that respect, and the effect of this legislation will be that those women will be deprived of their rights to return, albeit the Government may say not deliberately. It is a highly undesirable change that is being made on that ground alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the EEC question, I was interested in particular to hear my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton), because I know that he has had some pronounced views on the EEC over quite a long period. t was only to demonstrate his objectivity and dispassionate concern in these matters, I am sure, that he showed us that, in general, on these matters the EEC is in advance of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the hon. and learned Gentleman took a different view, and one could argue indefinitely about the international comparisons. Whatever type of employment one looks at, it is always difficult to make precise comparisons. But whather or not we are in advance of the EEC—and my understanding has always been that we still lag rather behind—it is no thanks to the present Government, and what they are doing in this piece of legislation will certainly push us further behind than ever. About that there is no doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for the crumb he gave us on amendment No. 138. Perhaps he thinks it is more than a crumb; shall we say a crust? That is helpful. I do not want to go into detail on amendment No. 137, because my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) pressed the hon. and learned Gentleman very hard on it. But I offered what seemed to me to be a reasonable get-out—a compromise, perhaps—in that the first half of that amendment, subsection (3B), could well have stood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman is saying that the possibility of risk is theoretical. Perhaps that is so. Perhaps it is unlikely ever to happen, though my industrial relations experience leads me to believe that it is when people think that things will not happen, often they do happen. The hon. and learned Gentleman stuck his neck out quite a long way in suggesting that it was purely a matter of theory. But if it is relatively unimportant—certainly as he sees it—it would not hurt him to accept the amendment and build it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1134">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1179</span>
into the Bill. If it is not used, so be it. I do not see why he is worried. We seek only to cover that remote possibility, which he suggested is the most that we could expect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 142, the hon. and learned Gentleman's argument was rather extraordinary. He accepted that the first part of the amendment was in line with the earlier amendment for which he expressed support in principle. But he went on to say that he could not accept the idea of actually prescribing a form of words because that would add to the bureaucracy. My contention is that it would do quite the reverse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the hon. and learned Gentleman's aversion to forms, particularly new forms. We know that there has been a directive from on high to reduce the number of forms issued. But that is not the important point. This kind of form and this kind of prescribed form of words would reduce bureaucracy. They would give both employer and employee some kind of certainty about what is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that small employers in particular would welcome that. They will have to produce a piece of paper with words on it, in any case. Surely it would be much better to have someone doing the job for them. They would be able to fall back on the form. There would be no doubt and no risk of cases being contested at industrial tribunals on the basis of whether the form of words was as required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be in the interests not merely of the employee but of the employer if the Government were to think again on that. Although the hon. and learned Gentleman rejected the amendment, I hope that lie will have further reflections on it. It is not unreasonable, and it is certainly not a party point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course; it is not a party point. I accept that at once. But does the hon. Gentleman not see that, if the employer had made it absolutely clear and had written setting it out in black and white but it was not on a form, his own protection under this provision would go? That would be seen to be absurd. He had made it absolutely clear, there was no question about its having been communicated, but it was not on the form. We wish to avoid that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that point and accept it. To use the hon. and learned Gentleman's
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1180</span>
words in another context, my reply is that it is a theoretical claim. That is a remote possibility, much more remote than the possibility about which he was talking on the earlier amendment. It could happen, but I should not have thought that that was an overriding objection. Indeed, I go further. I suggest to him that, as he on occasion ventures a view on what the industrial tribunals might decide, were that situation to occur and were that letter to be produced before a tribunal it is difficult to believe that a tribunal would not take into account that it had been spelt out clearly, even though it was not on the prescribed form. I recognise that its judgment would be circumscribed by what the legislation provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two weeks' basic pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be, but I should be surprised if that were much of an obstacle. Perhaps by a minor drafting amendment that point could be taken care of. We should not play with words unduly in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 143, again I should have been happy to have seen a minor drafting amendment. In dealing with this, it would have answered the hon. and learned Gentleman's point if we had simply slipped in the word "acceptable" after "produce", and make it read "produce acceptable evidence". I think that that, at any rate, would have satisfied the legalistic point he made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I still find this business of the "burden of proof" which arises on amendment No. 143 unsatisfactory in the way in which the hon. and learned Gentleman has put it, because once again one does not need to take the part of either the employer or the employee. Employers might seek deliberately to be difficult about the matter. It might be an employer who would like to get rid of a woman who had perhaps been a thorn in his side for one of a number of reasons. He wants to get rid of her, so he actually does not send her the notice. When she seeks her job back, he says "No, you have not complied". It would be perfectly possible, if it was not a registered or a recorded delivery letter, for him to produce a copy of a letter that he purported to have sent, or even produce a witness to that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other side of the coin, we all know of people, and the employee might be such a person, who are evasive, who do
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1135">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1181</span>
not want to give any sort of undertaking and who are not prepared to assist in the certainty which the hon. and learned Gentleman wants to create. Such an employee might say that a letter had not been received. Perhaps the easiest example of that sort of thing happening is in immigration cases. We all have to handle these for our constituents and not infrequently we find that a contest about whether a letter has ever been received from the Home Office, probably including an instruction that somebody has to be deported. It is always difficult for people to make up their minds whether a letter has been received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that the burden of proof is not actually the issue. I suggest that from the point of view of both the employer and the employee, it would be desirable to have something written into the legislation on the lines of the amendment. If the wording is not accurate, we shall be happy to accept a change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. and learned Gentleman—and he was, I think, referring to amendment No. 143—talked about not creating more uncertainty in the law. That is a phrase which sits very uneasily on the Under-Secretary's lips in view of what is going on throughtout the Bill, because that is precisely what is happening in clause after clause. It is happening on clause 10, and were he to accept these amendments I am sure that they would help to reduce the uncertainty. They would certainly not increase it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1183</span>
arguments relate to some of the discussion that we have already had this morning. The Bill changes the final notification period before return to work to 21 days from seven days. The Equal Opportunities Commission submitted the view initially—and the hon. and learned Gentleman has referred to this—that the first notification before absence should not be tied to a loss of rights and that, as the final notification might be the only one, 28 days' notice would be appropriate. That was its earlier proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the Bill now requires two mandatory notifications and another optional one. In view of that, I suggest that there is no ground for increasing the length of time before the final notification, and that seven days is quite enough for the employer who may now have two affirmations of the woman's intention to return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I am correct in saying that the employer already has the right to postpone the return to work for up to 28 days after the notified day for any reason that he cares to specify, under section 47 of the 1978 Act. So he has that additional option. In view of that, I should have thought that this was an unnecessary change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 140 and 141 are probing amendments. It seems here that there is a change against the interests of the employee. Our amendment would equalise the relationship between the employer and the employee. If the law is to be tightened up so that a woman has to give notice of her return well in advance, as is proposed, the amendment ensures that the employer must notify her of any postponement he wants to make. It seems unfair that a woman may have made all the necessary child-care arrangements to return to work on a particular day, and only then is she told—perhaps the day previously—that the employer wants to postpone her return. We are seeking an equalisation, and I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will be able to respond sympathetically to these amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first of these amendments has the effect of nullifying the provision of clause 10(3)(	<i>b</i>) which provides for 21 days for the final notice; in fact, it puts it back to the seven days' notice which is provided for by the existing law. One can usefully approach this issue by
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1184</span>
asking why the existing law provides for any terminal notification. Why does the existing Act require that, if a woman is to claim her rights to be reinstated, she must give any notice after her confinement before she comes back? The answer to that, I should have thought, was plain. In practice, an employer needs to be given warning, first, that he will have to get rid of the replacement—if he has been lucky enough to get one—whom he engaged to take the place of the employee who went off to have a baby. Secondly, it is reasonable and necessary that the employer should have some warning that he is to expect his former employee back on the shop floor. Of those two, I think the first is possibly the more important, but the second is certainly fairly important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we discuss the question of maternity and reinstatement rights, I find that nearly always the interests of the replacement worker are overlooked; but they are important. If a person is taken on to replace somebody who has gone off on maternity leave, she is in a fairly disadvantageous position in any event. When the woman comes back and the employer wants to get rid of the replacement—which is putting it rather brutally—he can say "Thank you very much for standing in, but we do not need you any more". There is no question of unfair dismissal compensation, however excellent she may have done the job, not only because she has not qualified for it in terms of the time that she has worked, but because of the express provision in the 1978 and 1975 Acts that she shall not be able to claim for unfair dismissal. She is able to claim only for proper notice. Therefore, her rights are very much reduced. So she is already in a fairly disadvantageous position. Additionally, the employer now has only seven days' notice that his former employee is to come back
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the principle is conceded that some notice has to be given, I think we should all agree that it ought to be reasonable notice to meet the practicalities of the case. What we are saying here is that three weeks gives a more reasonable chance to an employer to make the necessary arrangements, not only on his own behalf but on behalf of the replacement worker, than does a mere seven days. It is not a matter which is susceptible of great debate; it is a matter of judgment. That is why, in a nutshell, we believe that the change is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1137">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1185</span>
Can it really be said to be a great derogation from the rights of the woman in these circumstances? She is entitled at the end of 29 weeks to come back and resume her job. But, instead of saying that she is going to do that seven days beforehand, she will have to say so 21 days before. I do not think that any of the arguments about volatility and uncertainty and the aftereffects of childbirth and so forth can conceivably be said to apply here, because we are talking about a period which may be as much as 26 weeks after childbirth. Therefore, we are looking at it simply in terms of what is practical and reasonable. In the circumstances, it is difficult to mount an argument against extending seven days to 21 days, and I must advise my hon. Friends to resist the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 140 and 141 were fairly described by the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) as probing amendments. The effect of amendment No. 140 is to pave the way for amendment No. 141. No. 141, in the first part, states that the employer shall give "written notice" to the employee 21 days before that date when she had intended to return to work. What we are talking about here is the notice that an employer can give that he wishes to postpone by up to 28 days the date when she can come back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, Central rightly said that there was no limitation on the reasons on which he can rely for postponing by up to 28 days the date of the employee's return. That is perfectly correct under the existing law. The effect of this amendment is to say that, if he is going to give her notice for some specified reason, he ought to do it in writing. He says that this is fair dos. As the woman is being required to reply in writing and to give her confirmation in writing if she wants to come back, there is no reason why the employer should not give these specified reasons for postponing the date of her return in writing. There is some force in that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should not the employer have to do it in less than 21 days? One has to look at the objective of this particular right in the first place. The objective must be that if the employer is faced with some sudden circumstance that makes it impractical or gravely inconvenient to take back into employment the woman we are talking about for a maximum of 28 days, he should be able to say "Hold it. You are coming
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1186</span>
back, your rights are not imperilled, but they are postponed for up to 28 days for the reason which I give you."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he had to do that not less than 21 days before she came back, it would impose an impossible burden upon him, because she does not have to give her notice until 21 days beforehand. If he has to give notice of special reasons 21 days before the relevant date, he would have to do it on the very day that he got her notice. Obviously that is not reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More important is the question that it has to be in writing. At the moment it does not have to be in writing. This is designed to give flexibility to an employer in circumstances which may suddenly arise. If it has to be in writing, issues may arise on the precise words used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about only 28 days' postponement. I do not think that the practical grounds for making this amendment to the clause have been made out. t is enough that the employer should give a specified reason. By reason of the fact that the rights are being postponed for a maximum of only 28 days, we do not believe that the greater rigidity that this amendment would impose would be compensated for by any substantial benefit. Therefore, I advise my hon. Friends to resist all these amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall have to agree to differ on amendment No. 144. In making that point, I was touched by the faith in the rights of temporary workers which the hon. and learned Gentleman expressed, not for the first time. He seemed to be suggesting that it was a pity that they did not have unfair dismissal rights. That seemed to be implied in what he said. There is a considerable conflict between the concern expressed by the hon. and learned Gentleman and what the Government have done in recent months in terms of doubling the qualifying period before people can obtain compensation for unfair dismissal. Without returning to the arguments that I have already put forward, I do not think the particular reasons for resisting this amendment really hold much water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I described the other amendments as primarily probing, and I take the hon. and learned Gentleman's point about the 21 days. However, the Under-Secretary said that the question of written notice has force in it. We are not even suggesting, as we did on an earlier amendment, a prescribed form. We simply say "written
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1138">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1187</span>
notice." I should not have thought that, despite what the hon. and learned Gentleman said about practical difficulties, that was an insuperable obstacle for an employer in this situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Under-Secretary rejects the amendments, I ask him, as I did in respect of a previous amendment concerning a prescribed form—in a sense it forms part of the pattern—to reflect further on the matter and perhaps come back to the subject on Report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During our discussions on the amendments we covered a good deal of ground in respect of the wider application of clause 10. I do not intend to weary the Committee for long, but it would be wrong for us to allow clause 10 to stand part of the Bill without reiterating, and perhaps emphasising, a few of the matter which have caused the Opposition particular concern. We have been critical of the hon. and learned Gentleman concerning a number of clauses on the basis that the Government's case for change has not been effectively made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On clause 10, I submit that the Government's case for change has been the weakest so far. I say "so far" because we shall reach clause 11 next, and I suspect that the Under-Secretary's case on that clause will be even weaker, not stronger. Despite the Minister's attempts, particularly on Tuesday, to produce evidence, I suggest that he failed miserably to demonstate the need for change. I maintain that it is the Government's task to demonstrate the need for change when proposing important and fundamental alterations in the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I began by saying that the hon. and learned Gentleman would have difficulty in finding facts to distort. He did not disappoint me, because he found some facts and managed to distort them. I feel that he did the Low Pay Unit an injustice with what he did to its findings. I suggest that there was a certain amount of legal trickery about the Minister's presentation of the unit's case, because the unit's report was meant very much to support our arguments. Indeed, I submit that the Low Pay Unit's report supported the Opposition's argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman also
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1188</span>
obtained a crumb of comfort out of the Equal Opportunities Commission's evidence, if "evidence" is the correct word. But, even there, he was forced to take words out of the context in order to use them in support of his argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have spent some time discussing the three notifications. As I said on an earlier amendment, I consider that it is one of the most fallacious arguments of all for the Government to pressume that they are creating more certainty for employers, leaving aside employees. As I said, we shall have two classes of employee. First, there will be those who understand and will therefore make sure that they safeguard their rights in writing, irrespective of whether they want to go back to work. Secondly, we shall have the second category of workers—I mentioned particularly immigrant women, but the matter goes wider than that—who will not understand this new complicated, confussed and complex procedure and, so a consequence, will effectively be deprived of their rights. That is a serious matter. I submit that the Government are making a grave mistake in imposing that change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday, at the TUC women's conference, the General Secretary of the TUC, Mr. Len Murray, had something to say about these matters. He said much the same sort of thing as I said in an earlier discussion on the Bill; that the Government are making a serious attack on the rights of working women—on nursery education, which is of particular concern to working women, on women's rights in immigration and on a number of other matters. In this 'clause there is what one can only describe as a deliberate attempt to weaken the rights of working women. Therefore, we shall oppose the clause when a vote is taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When history comes to be written, this Government will be described as the Government of petty meannesses. The clause is one of the pettiest and meanest of their petty meannesses. Almost the whole of their social policy is an attack on the most vulnerable sections of the community—the old, the young and the sick. They are discriminatory in that regard. As my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) has just said and as Mr. Murray said last night, they are specifically discriminaroty against

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1189</span>
women in general and working women in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Working women are a vulnerable sector of the community for a number of reasons. Many are in insecure occupations. Many are in occupations characterised by the lowest level of pay. Many are doing two jobs a paid one and an unpaid one. They do their day's work and then have to clean, cook, look after kids and run a home. They cannot go out in the evenings to trade union meetings and get the benefit of the advice of trade unions in the way that their husbands or other men can. The women covered by this clause are for the most part—there are, of course, exceptions—not very articulate, not very conscious of their rights, not very knowledgeable on how to go about protecting, defending and safeguarding their rights, and are without the capacity, because of other commitments, to be persistent, active and strong in the defence and protection of their rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why this woman-led Government have directed a large part of their fire upon them. They are easy meat. They are not the sort to make as much fuss as some others will. They are ready victims. They are, in the view of the Government, lambs to the slaughter. It is to be remarked—it has been remarked before, but it will not suffer in repetition—that we had to wait to have a woman Prime Minister before we got such anti-women, discriminatory, sexist legislation over a wide area of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from their discrimination on immigration between men and women, I doubt whether there is anything in the whole of the Government's programme where their anti-women attitude comes out so clearly, pettily, meanly and nauseatingly as it does in this clause. It does the Government no credit. I have the feeling that in future it will be recalled when many things, which on the face of it are of weightier moment, have been forgotten.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Madel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After the probing amendments tabled by the Opposition, it has become clear that there are certain duties and responsibilities on employers and that if they do not carry them out, they cannot expect to win a case or to be held to be in the right should any matter go to an industrial tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first point that I want to make on subsection (2), which I think has had the greatest combing in our debate, that it is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1190</span>
the employer's duty not earlier than 49 days after the expected confinement, to write to the employee asking whether she wishes to return to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an earlier debate, I drew attention to the words in line 34:
	<br><blockquote><p>"her employer or a successor of his".</p></blockquote>
This is an extra, understandable and perfectly correct onus on employers. If a firm has merged, has been taken over or has gone into receivership and is still trading, that does not take away the obligation from the new employer, the receiver, or whoever it might be, to take the first step and write to the employee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, although these words do not meet with the full favour of the Opposition, I think that it is right to stress that
	<br><blockquote><p>"within fourteen days … or, if that is not reasonably practicable, as soon as reasonably practicable"</p></blockquote>
the employee or former employee must say whether she wishes to return to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had an interesting debate on how to prove whether the letter from the employer had arrived. If the former employee has changed her address, as I see it, the onus still rests on the employer to write to the new address. It will not be enough to say that he had written to the old address and there had not been a reply. Obviously there would not be a reply if the employee was not living there. So, again, there is an onus on the employer, not on the employee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, I draw attention to section 33(5) of the 1978 Act. The Government are, quite rightly, not changing section 33(5) of the 1978 Act. That provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An employee shall not be entitled to either of the rights referred to in subsection (1)"</p></blockquote>
—the right to return to work, which we are discussing—
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless, if requested to do so by her employer, she produces for his inspection a certificate from a registered medical practitioner or a cerrified midwife srating the expected week of her confinement".</p></blockquote>
As I said earlier, where there is a complicated pregnancy and the aftereffects are difficult, I look to the doctor, off his own bat, to write to the employer "My patient—your former employee—has had a difficult pregnancy and is in no position to say whether or not she will be returning to work".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1140">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1191</span>
We are used to the contact between employer and doctor, because section 33(5) of the 1978 Act gives him a right to ask for a medical certificate. I hope that, when the Bill becomes law, area health authorities will send round circulars to general practitioners reminding them that clause I0 makes an alteration to the 1978 Act and suggesting that the onus is on them to write to the employer to make sure that there is no problem because a woman has had a difficult confinement. It is perfectly reasonable to expect doctors to do that. They already have this link with the employer because of section 33(5) of the Act. I hope that the area health authorities will be able to help in that way when the Bill becomes law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a mean and despicable clause in a mean and despicable Bill. It has been introduced by the Government because they say that there is some uncertainty among employers about how many women will return to work after pregnancy. But we have had no indication of research done to establish what the numbers are. Some limited surveys have been taken by the Equal Opportunities Commission and by the Law Pay Unit, an these show that there is a tremendous variety of statistics, depending upon the particular industry in which women work. In some industries about one-third of the women who leave to have babies subsequently return. In others it is as low as 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. We have pressed the Under-Secretary to supply us with detailed statistics on which he bases his case that there should be some certainty about how many women will return to work after pregnancy, and we have had no answer. Of course, it largely depends upon the economic circumstances of particular women. In the industrial North, in the Midlands, the urban conurbations where working-class people live, it is essential for a woman to return—and many do, even in ill-health, because economic circumstances compel them to. A young married couple may have purchased a house. They are paying on a 15 per cent. mortgage, paying in- creased rates, paying increased electricity and gas charges and the rest. In all these circumstances, it is essential in many working-class families for the woman to return to work as soon as possible after pregnancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That can be contrasted with what
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1192</span>
happens in other parts of the country. For example, in the gin and tonic belt in Surrey a man may be earning £I5,000 or £20,000 a year. His wife may feel no economic compulsion to return. She may be a university graduate and prefer to have two or three years with her children before returning to a profession. So we have to remember that it will be almost impossible to supply the certainty that the hon. and learned Gentleman tells us employees want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking the matter a little further, we asked the hon. and learned Gentleman what representations had been made to him. We understand that he has had a letter from the CBI—or a telephone call, for all I know—suggesting that it would welcome this clause. The CBI has not undertaken any statistical work. It has not tried to discover whether it is possible to forecast how many women are likely to return to work after preganncy. Indeed, the Under-Secretary was forced back to read into his speech a long extract from the Low Pay Unit which set out the case against the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend referred to the CBI. I am sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong, but I understood him to refer not to the CBI itself but to the CBI small firms council, and on the CBI small firms council, I believe there is no representative of a firm with fewer than 100.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. Friend for that information, which reinforces my case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary tells us that he has in his postbag many letters from small employers. Conservative Members are very fond of supporting the cause of small employers, and we are told that he has many letters from them urging him to introduce this clause. That is very strange because, as far as I know, no Member on our side has received a single letter and we are in touch with many small firms in our constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is significant that, while the Under-Secretary was floundering and waffling his way through this clause, none of his hon. Friends rose to say that they, too, had had dozens or hundreds of letters from small firms saying what a good thing it was to incorporate the clause into this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1141">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1193</span>
It is impossible to give employers any certainty about how many women will return to employment after pregnancy. There is no such thing as a standard woman, and there is no such thing as a standard pregnancy. These matters cannot be dealt with as statistics, because all sorts of problems may arise, post-natal depression and other complications. Some women have little difficulty in giving birth, others have a great deal of difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can therefore regard this clause as one of discrimination. It would have been of value to the Committee to have had with us a woman Member or women Members who could have explained in greater detail the sort of problems that have to be faced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trade union movement has taken part in the long struggle for equal rights for women. We have made tremendous progress in recent years. So far as I can see, this is the first backward step that we have been invited to take, It is discrimination against women workers. It will put them in an unfavourable position in comparison with women in other European countries. My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) set out the position in EEC countries, which have a better approach to this problem than we have here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is curious that in legislation designed to curtail what is regarded as the overwhelming power of the trade union movement there should be inserted a clause discriminating in particular against women workers irrespective of whether they are in the trade union movement. This will create tremendous dissatisfaction among women workers. It will perhaps curtail the opportunities of employers to recruit staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These proposals should be rejected. I repeat that this is a mean and despicable clause in a mean and despicable Bill that a mean and despicable Government are trying to get on to the statute book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like the hon. and learned Gentleman to answer a small question. Since the process which results in a confinement takes quite a long time, will there be any provision to assist women who become pregnant before the Bill is enacted and who therefore could not know that their rights would be less by the time of childbirth than they are now? We are, in a sense, retrospectively penalising women who, at the time they conceived,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1194</span>
had certain rights but will have those rights later diminished</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. and learned Gentleman wants to go down in history as the Minister who introduced additional notifications. I think that he will live to regret the clause. He calls it a small but useful change. It is a small change in one way, perhaps, because it affects few people, as very few take up the maternity rights. If I am not wrong, I think that the Low Pay Unit says that the number is about 11,000, or 0.3 per cent. Certainly, there is considerable uncertainty about these maternity rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I doubt that the change will be useful, for the reasons that my hon. Friends and I have advanced on the various amendments. It will not lead to any greater certainty for employers, but it will lead—this is almost certain—to much greater uncertainty for employees. That is the crucial issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are reducing maternity rights, and in that sense they are discriminating against working women. My hon. Friend has already talked about what Len Murray said yesterday. As a member of, and a Member of Parliament sponsored by the General and Municipal Workers' Union, which has many women members, I know that my union objects strongly to this clause and to the next, clause 11.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know the key role that married women's wages play in earnings. I think that it was the Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth and the DHSS which showed that the number of low-income families and the incidence of poverty would increase threefold if it were not for the wages of women earners. The Employment Protection Act, to use the hon. and learned Gentleman's phraseology slightly amended, introduced a substantial but useful change in maternity rights which benefited working women. The Government are seeking to diminish those rights. They have given no concrete evidence showing why those rights should be reduced. That is our charge against them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government seem to want to satisfy certain prejudices and misconceptions in the Conservative Party. The first is that the Employment Protection Act has substantially shifted the balance of power away from employers towards employees. There is little evidence that it has substantially shifted power. The second is that in some way small employers were badly hit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1142">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1195</span>
It is those two misconceptions which so colour the Government's attitude to workers' rights, and they are the reason why they are trying to change them. It is regrettable that they should introduce this unattractive discriminatory clause. I hope that on Report they will reconsider their attitude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I oppose the clause, and I should not like anyone to think that the hon. and learned Gentleman's explanations have lessened our objections to it. We are completely opposed to it in principle. It is unnecessary. We have heard no evidence of any demand for such changes, and no evidence that the present maternity provisions have caused any problems in British industry. The whole thing is mean and petty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Millions of women go to work. They do so not for pin money or pocket money but to make a contribution to the household budget. If they did not go to work, many of them would be forced to draw supplementary benefit. I find something repugnant in the spectacle of a largely middle-aged or elderly male Parliament legislating to diminish the rights of women, particularly the weakest section of women those having babies. It is wrong to make childbearing more difficult or more onerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am reminded of our recent discussions on abortion. Those who came to lobby me who were against abortion all made the point that society should be more helpful to women who have babies so that they need not resort to abortion. We should give more rights to women in childbirth. But here we seem to be doing the opposite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer again to the notification after confinement, on which we spent so much time this morning. An employer may write to an employee
	<br><blockquote><p>"not earlier than forty-nine days after the beginning of the expected week of confinement"</p></blockquote>
requesting written confirmation of her intention to return. A young woman in those circumstances may not be certain whether she wants to come back. She may not have made up her mind whether she wants to stay with her baby, whether she can afford to do so, or whether she wants to go back to work. There are problems about child-minders and so on. It could be her first baby. She could be overwhelmed by the situation. But if she receives such a letter from her employer and she does not reply within 14 days, she loses her right to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1196</span>
return to her job. It is the equivalent of the sack. If that is not a diminution of women's rights, I do not know what is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) kindly referred to my objectivity in relation to the EEC. This is legendary and well known. It is known that I sometimes find it difficult to perceive what advantages we get from membership of that body. But I should explain that the better maternity package in many EEC countries arises in no way from their membership of the EEC, because there are no regulations on these matters. They are decided by the individual Parliaments. That is what we are doing here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that many of the provisions in other countries predated the EEC, and I suspect, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) pointed out, that if we looked to the other European countries outside the EEC we should find that their rights were better. I suspect—although I do not have the evidence here—that we should find better rights in the eastern European countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. and learned Gentleman compares the maternity rights packages in the member countries of the EEC, one of the things he might look at is the maternity grant. A maternity grant in this country is £25. In Belgium the maternity grant for a first child is £311, so there is a striking difference. In France there is a pre-natal allowance in three instalments—£43, then £87, and then £65. Then there is a postnatal allowance, again in three instalments, of £129, £64 and another £64. The Under-Secretary might take that into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to press my hon. Friend too hard on a sensitive spot, but in relation to the EEC I wonder whether he would agree, not least in view of the figures that he has just been giving, that it would be no bad thing, irrespective of his views about the desirability of Britain being in or out of the EEC, if there were a measure of harmonisation? It would seem that it would be a harmonisation upwards from our point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the reverse is the case and the hon. and learned Gentleman is correct, it would be no bad thing if the United Kingdom Government were pressing for harmonistion to bring the other EE3 countries into line with our superior standards. But they are not pursuing that line. I have had an

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1197</span>
answer to a parliamentary question which makes perfectly clear that the United Kingdom Government are not interested in harmonisation in this field, which underlines the point that my hon. Friend was making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One further point: my hon. Friend may even be prepared to agree with me that, in these days of reactionary Conservative Government, the EEC Commission itself is almost a haven of progress and enlightenment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that any institution would be more enlightened than the present Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has rightly outlined the far better deal in the individual EEC countries compared with our own, particularly on the maternity package. Will he agree that if there was a move to harmonise this important social legislation, all the evidence coming from the present Government ironically, led by a woman—is that they would veto any proposal to improve the lot of women in this country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that is right. I have seen no evidence that they want to improve these matters. Certainly the Prime Minister gives no evidence that she wants to do so. She seems to think that it should be left to the individual and not be done by collective community provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: She may not be needing maternity leave.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: She's all right, Jill. That is right. It is against her philosophy of life, I think. We should look at international comparisons and seek to raise our standards up to the highest in other countries inside and outside the EEC.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the presence of the Secretary of State, who is, no doubt, making a fleeting visit to the Committee.

[	<i>An hon. Member:</i> "Disgraceful".] I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will find time to make a contribution to the debate here as well as to the wider debate outside.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1199</span>
Bill. The changes that they are proposing, for example in the law relating to picketing, stem entirely from the political advantage that is seen to accrue from engaging in union bashing immediately preceding the general election. Perhaps the Government were lumbered with these commitments and had to produce changes. I can under- stand that they thought that there was political mileage in bashing SLADE, and that there was political mileage in seeking to do something about small firms, and about codes of practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that I can understand and accept, but I cannot understand the reason for this clause. I cannot understand what has pushed the Government in this direction and what motivates them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends have echoed what I said on Second Reading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Perhaps the Government believe that their attacks on—picketing and on union membership agreements will divert attention from their mean- minded and needtessly provocative whittling down of protection for individual workers, such as maternity rights, guaranteed payments, the rights of workers on fixed-term contracts, and the further changes in the unfair dismissal provisions."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 December 1979; Vol. 976, c. 152.]</p></blockquote>
I find it incredible that a Government who ought to be seeking to maximise any good will that may exist among workers and their organisations should so needlessly alienate that with such meanminded, petty and provocative little measures such as this present Bill. They really ought to be trying at the present time. Heaven knows, they are doing enough in other areas. But any Government need all the good will they can get, all the support that they can attract—rough as it may be, they must try—from workers and their organisations. They should not needlessly sour the climate within which industrial relations are conducted in this way, with needless pinpricks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was making the point. The Conservatives were saying things at the time which seemed likely to attract electoral support, heedless of the effect of those things on industrial relations, heed-

less of the wisdom and good judgment of doing so. They were only concerned at that time to cash in on the political popularity of taking that line.

I do not want to detain the Committee any longer, except to tell the Government now that these parts of the Bill that bear on the maternity provisions are amongst those matters to which we shall seek to return on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall address myself to the principle of the clause, which is to advance the interests of women who wish to work. This it does by simple and practical measures. It teakes note of the fact—and the Government, in putting it forward, take note of the fact—that women play a very important part in the maintenance of our economy and in the maintenance of the economies of their families and households. That is about the only part of the speech made by the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) with which I was able to agree. He then went on to describe the clause in a series of not very original epithets: that it was mean, discriminating, unfair, and, not to my surprise, he was taken up in that mistaken impression by the hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher), who said that it was discriminating against women.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

How are we to avoid discriminating either against or in favour of women if we take into account the needs of those who go off work in order to have babies? We can hardly do the same for men. f he is saying that there should be 40 weeks' paternity leave and the right to reinstatement, I think the Labour Party should say so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

because of their economic circumstances and those who do not need to do so because they are probably affluent members of the middle class, and so on. In the main, this discriminates against working women who are compelled by economic circumstances to work, as against those who do not regularly seek to return almost immediately to employment. That is what I mean by "discrimination".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is exactly the other way round. The Bill seeks to improve the position of those who are obliged to work by making it more attractive to employers to take such people into their employment. That is the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why is everybody against it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are not. We have heard numerous speeches from the Opposition, including the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant). But they appear to be as reluctant to listen to a reply as they were to listen to the evidence which I gave to a substantial extent at our last sitting. I remind the hon. Gentleman of some of that evidence now. He has asked why everyone is against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the Equal Opportunities Commission. There may be expostulations that that is special pleading and that the EOC cannot be expected to be other than wholly in support of any Conservative measure. We have not generally come across that attitude. I will read its recommendation before I go further. It is true that it is against the first pre-confinement notice, but its recommendation is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission rejects the proposals in the working papers and suggests that the current notification required before leaving employment should be dropped; that this should be replaced by an optional notification to be initiated by the employer not earlier than 6 weeks after the expected date of confinement; that final notification of the date of return should be made in writing at least 28 days before that date."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Islington, Central asks why everyone is against us. But he must concede that on the points with which we are dealing here—the intermediate request for confirmation and the notice that has to be given before return, whether it is 7, 21 or 28 days—he has slightly overstated his case in a rare departure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was kind of the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1202</span>
and learned Gentleman to put it as a rare departure. But he is again misrepresenting the situation. In my earlier remarks, I made it clear that he could secure a crumb of comfort from the EOC, but that the EOC's verdict which he has just quoted was made in a different context—not in the context of the Bill but in the context of the consultative document. There is a considerable difference. On every other point that he has raised, the EOC's view differs from that of the Government's.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with other points when we reach clauses that bear upon them. But the important point to remember here is that the EOC recognises the desirability of working women, of exactly the type and class to which the hon. Member for Darlington has just referred, getting work. What lies behind the Government's proposals is that it is unattractive to employers to offer them work when, under the existing law, there is too long a gap between the time when they have to notify their intention of coming back to work after confinement and the time when they come back.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where is the evidence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has asked where all these letters are. I had to deal with a letter only yesterday. It is the latest, but it has a bearing. It comes from a headmaster and relates to the 40 weeks' protected employment for women taking maternity leave. He says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This has meant that in my school a woman left for maternity leave on 28th September 1979, her confinement was (a fortnight late) on 31st December and the adjusted leave with protection does not expire until 21st July 1980. I am, by law, unable to advertise the vacancy for a permanent replacement until after 21st July, since the law does not allow her to abdicate her rights. I am sure that you can see the implications for staffing in my school. Two years have to pass before the disruptions caused by this event work themselves out of the system. I was unable to replace her adequately until January 1st 1980, and because I cannot advertise her replacement until September (effectively) I shall not be able to appoint until January 1981…it is well known that good staff are rarely acquired"—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
