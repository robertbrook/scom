</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I genuinely did not intend to make a speech on this group of amendments, but in the light of the reply given by the Under-Secretary of State, who said that he hoped that he would not have to speak again, I felt that I must say something.<br><br>
Some resentment has been expressed that an amendment that was not selected—I make no complaint about that, Mr. Goodhew, I merely state the fact—apparently triggered off discussions within the Government ranks which enabled them to come forward with significant changes in the clause at a very late stage. There may well be some employers, and even more employees, in the constituency of the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Madel) who will find the change adverse rather than beneficial, so he will be able to pride himself on having achieved a significant worsening of an already bad provision. Therefore, when hon. Members on both sides begin to receive letters from aggrieved constituents, I hope that they will remember to forward them to the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, South.<br><br>
I raise that point because I have just come from a meeting of the all-party disablement group which was convened to discuss amendments tabled to clause 11. In my discussion with the chairman after that meeting about what seemed to me to be the faulty construction of the amendments, I was told that it did not matter because the Government had said after their discussions that they intended to accept the principles of those amendments anyway. It is extremely shabby treatment of the Committee that we should toil away, carefully preparing reasonable amendments and putting forward our arguments in debate, all to be swept aside by a Government who are prepared to enter into all kinds of back-stage deals with their own members.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman gave for the second time the reasons for amend-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1035">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 993</span>
ment No. 129. However, a large number of other amendments have been put forward for debate and have been spoken to very eloquently by my hon. Friend the Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Radice). To the best of my recollection, the hon. and learned Gentleman said not one word about them. Yet he hoped that he would not have to speak again. I accept that if the Government's amendment were carried, as they expect, those amendments would fall out of order. But if they are not amendments to the new provisions, that is not our fault; it is because the Government put forward these changes at a very late stage.<br><br>
We are entitled to know the Government's response to these other amendments. Even if they do not fit in with the Government's new proposals, the principle remains.<br><br>
I draw particular attention to our amendment No. 102. Even if one accepted, as the Opposition certainly do not, the argument put forward by the hon. and learned Gentleman in favour of the change, he made no argument for not excluding reasons of redundancy from the worsening of the unfair dismissal provisions now being proposed to the Committee. Likewise, the hon. and learned Gentleman has ignored the important and still relevant point, contained in our amendment No. 104, which requires that
<br><blockquote><p>"the dismissed employee is at the time of his dismissal given a written declaration that at no time since the first day referred to in paragraph (<i>a</i>)"—</p></blockquote>
in the Bill as drafted
<br><blockquote><p>"had the number of employees exceeded nineteen".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to ascertain what would be the situation if a new employee were engaged at a time when the firm employed less than 20 people yet at some subsequent time—perhaps six months later—the number of employees rose above 20 persons. The employment would instantly be taken outside the scope of the new provision. What would happen if subsequently, because of a fluctuating work load, the number of employees dropped back to under 20?<br><br>
Had the new provisions not been introduced, the employee might during the succeeding 18 or 15 months have become qualified to make a complaint of unfair dismissal. In those circumstances, would the employee have his right restored
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 994</span>
because at one time the employer was employing more than 20 employees? Or would the original disqualification continue for the whole period of two years?<br><br>
I know that these are complicated questions. But such are the real problems that may arise. Those of us who have been involved with introducing legislation in the past are only too well aware of that. It is no good saying that we are picking extreme examples that will never arise. My goodness, we know only too well that such cases do arise. They are not so extreme and hypothetical as all that.<br><br>
I should like the hon. and learned Gentleman to comment upon one further point. It relates to amendment No. 103. He dealt with that part of the amendment which refers to an employee who
<br><blockquote><p>"was in the employ of an associated employer".</p></blockquote>
However, there is an earlier limb to the amendment. It deals with the case of an employee who was
<br><blockquote><p>"in the employ of the employer of the first employee".</p></blockquote>
The kind of situation that I had in mind was as follows.<br><br>
Let us assume that Mr. Smith, an employer, employs a gardener at his home. Mr. Smith—I do not refer, of course, to the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith)—is a partner in the firm of Smith and Brown. Let us suppose that the firm of Smith and Brown employs less than 20 employees and that it has a vacancy. Mr. Smith suggests to his gardener that he would have better employment and better wages if he ceased to work as a gardener—perhaps he could come and do the work at the weekend as a bit of a tax fiddle—and took up regular employment with the firm of Smith and Brown.<br><br>
The gardener takes the advice. He enters into a new contract of employment with a new employer, notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Smith is a partner in the firm of Smith and Brown. Is Mr. Smith an associated employer? If so, any protection acquired as a gardener in Mr. Smith's service would continue when the man went to work for Smith and Brown. That is not at all clear from the Bill as it stands or from the explanation given by the hon. and learned Gentleman.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will not ignore the other amendments, either. In the interests of brevity and of making progress, I shall not speak to them. My hon. Friend the Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1036">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 995</span>
Chester-le-Street did so. They definitely deserve an answer—for example amendment No. 106, which accepts the logic of a later clause. It points out the anomalous numbers chosen to define small firms for the purposes of provisions relating to different types of restriction of employees' rights. I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will respond also to the other amendments that we have tabled, and will try to clarify for the benefit of those to whom the law will apply when enacted the points that I have raised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I quite acknowledge that in rising when I did to give clarification—primarily in the interests of the Chair, who was not present when the amendment was moved—I felt that I should have been speaking for an unconscionably long time if I dealt at that stage with all the amendments grouped here. I acknowledge that the Committee is entitled to an answer on them. I shall take them in the order in which they appear in the grouping.<br><br>
I am conscious that I did not say anything about amendment No. 106, which seeks to substitute a limit of five or less for that of less than 20. It bears on what was said by the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo), who unfortunately is not able to be here at the moment. He asked what was so marvellous about the figure 20, and then went on to ask whether such specification would put a bar on the desire of businesses to expand.<br><br>
We believe that 20 is about right, and that five is certainly far too little. It is at about the stage when 20 employees are on the payroll that businesses start to take on more than one tier of management. They then become better able to cope with administrative and legal responsibilities. They become less overborne by the complexities of the Employment Protection Act. For that reason, 20 appears to us to be about the right limit.<br><br>
Of course, businesses wish to expand, as the hon. Gentleman said, but they are often precarious until they reach the level of having about 20 employees. They are often precarious while there are fewer than 20 on the payroll. To be unable to trim one's payroll without having to pay compensation—in order, for example, to meet fluctuations in business—is a disincentive to taking on more than the bare minimum of staff. That is why I have to advise my
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 996</span>
hon. Friends to resist amendment No. 106.<br><br>
To reduce the limit to five is a very different matter in the case of the provision for maternity reinstatement later in the Bill, where the figure is five or less. The continuing administrative burdens of running a business are completely different from those involved in complying with the obligation to reinstate someone who has taken maternity leave.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman makes it sound a very lighthearted decision. One simply reduces one's payroll—just like that. One sacks someone—a matter of no great consequence. When we were dealing with the closed shop, we could find only four relevant cases of people being dismissed. Yet that was viewed as a matter of major importance. Does the hon. and learned Gentleman note the dichotomy in his approach to the two issues?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that there is either a dichotomy or—as I suspect the hon. Gentleman means—a conflict in what I said. The Government have made clear throughout that our intention in this part of the Bill is to encourage employment as much as we can without derogating in any material or harmful way from the principle of job protection. I agree that those objectives pull in opposite directions. The judgment lies in deciding how far we can go to meet one laudable and proper objective without doing harm to the other equally proper and laudable objective.<br><br>
I do not suggest for one moment that it is not deeply harming and upsetting to lose one's job in any circumstances. Of course that is true. But we are equally concerned to ensure that jobs that are there for the making should not be nipped in the bud because of the severity of the employment protection provisions. That is where the judgment lies.<br><br>
I can give an assurance on the subject of amendment No. 104. Once the protection of the clause has been lost because the numbers on the payroll have increased—let us say from 18 at the time that the man cited by the right hon. Gentleman was taken on board to 22 six months later, as he put it—the protection of the clause, which the employer had at the time the man was taken on to the payroll, has been lost. If the numbers subsequently declined to 18—say, two months later—the protection is not renewed in the case of that chap. In his case it is lost for ever.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1037">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 997</span>
The reason for that is that the protection of this clause is given only in the case of new employees. A new employee has to be given a notice setting out his position. That is a proper point to raise, but it is satisfactorily dealt with in the caluse as it is.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
Amendment No. 104 asks for a written declaration, to be given at the time of dismissal, that at no time had there been more than 19 employees in the undertaking. That would apply also to the provisions amended by the Government amendment. I appreciate the reason why it was put down by the right hon. Gentleman, and I hope that my explanation satisfies him. I hope that the amendment will not be pressed. However, if it is, I shall advise my hon. Friends to resist it.<br><br>
Amendment No. 102 is next in order. That amendment adds redundancy to the grounds or reasons for dismissal which should be outside the scope of the clause. I have to say that the Government cannot accept that. The effect would be to add redundancy to dismissal on grounds of trade union membership or activities and dismissal arising from medical suspension as a reason for dismissal to which the extended qualifying period of service for unfair dismissal does not apply. In other words, it would take it outside the scope of the clause. The qualifying period in the case of dismissal on the ground of redundancy would stay at 52 weeks.<br><br>
We do not see any reason why redundancy should be selected from the four OK reasons, as we have described them, as a reason that should take the case outside the scope of this clause. Even though one may be sacked, ostensibly for redundancy, that still does not preclude one from recovering compensation for unfair dismissal, as the right hon. Gentleman will recall. One can contest it and allege that one has been unfairly selected for redundancy, or that an equal test was not applied. That, of course, was so for all the other OK reasons.<br><br>
There still remains under our amendment, the test that the tribunal must apply as to whether the OK reason was a reasonable ground for dismissing somebody; in other words, whether the employer acted reasonably in taking the OK reason that is established as ground for dismissal. Therefore, we do not think that it is necessary to take redundancy
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 998</span>
alone of the OK reasons and enable a case based upon redundancy to be outside the scope of this clause. We do not think that that would be right.<br><br>
The effect of amendment No. 103—I think that I can be a little more encouraging here—is to ensure that an employee who, while remaining with the same employer or an associated employer, is transferred to an undertaking where the unfair dismissal exemption applies does not suffer any loss of protection from unfair dismissal. The advice that I give to the Committee is that the Government amendment to clause 7 will render unnecessary what appears to be the main point of the amendment. By treating as one unit all employees of an employer and any associated employers, it eliminates the possibility of an existing employee losing his protection by being transferred to an exempt undertaking owned by his employer or an associated employer.<br><br>
We do not believe that the amendment is necessary, but I nevertheless undertake to consider it. If we find that it is necessary, we shall consider it favourably.<br><br>
I took down—I hope, accurately—the scenario painted rather rapidly by the right hon. Gentleman about the gardener whose employer said "Why do you not stop being my gardener and come on to the payroll of Smith and Brown?" I am not sure what Smith and Brown do, but let us assume that they have a nice garden. The question was whether he would continue to be protected as being still in the employment of an associated employer.<br><br>
Whether the link is established in all such cases is a question of fact. There may not be continuity of employment in the example given by the right hon. Gentleman where a new contract of employment was entered into with Smith and Brown. That is not something which this clause affects. The clause safeguards the position of an employee who changes his job but remains in the employment of the same employer or an associated employer, where continuity of employment is preserved.<br><br>
If I may offer a personal view—which is always an extremely rash thing to do—of the illustration given by the right hon. Gentleman, assuming that continuity was established, I think that Smith and Brown would be associated employers. It would depend on whether Mr. Smith were an active or a sleeping partner. However, I suspect that the tribunal would in those
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1038">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 999</span>
circumstances probably find that they were an associated employer. In my view, it all turns on the facts.<br><br>
I believe that I have now covered all the points that I have been asked to deal with and which I did not deal with when I tried earlier to help the Committee. I do not know whether the right hon. Gentleman wishes not to press the amendment which</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fear that I may have to inflict a rather tedious and technical—and, I regret, rather lengthy—speech on the Committee, in the course of which I hope to encompass the arguments or both the amendments and the new clauses. I shall try to be as brief as possible, although I cannot promise to be entertaining.<br><br>
By way of background I shall be frank with the Committee and explain that the amendments and new clauses have been tabled after Opposition consultation with the National Union of Teachers, which has pointed out to us the anomalous position in which teachers at new small aided
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1039">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1001</span>
schools may find themselves as a consequence of the Bill.<br><br>
Teachers at a small aided school are appointed by and are in the employ of the managers or governors of the school yet their salaries are paid by the local education authority. The managers or governors have the exclusive right to dismiss a teacher appointed by them to give denominational religious instruction if he is not giving it efficiently and suitably. On the other hand, the local education authority is empowered to prohibit the dismissal of a teacher for any other reason without its consent and also has the power to require the dismissal of any teacher.<br><br>
One can contrast the position of teachers in small aided schools with that of other staff such as those employed to provide school meals. They will be appointed to the staff of the local education authority's school meals service and are not therefore the employees of the managers or governors.<br><br>
The special position of teachers in aided schools is already recognised, for example, in certain sections of the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978. Section 80 enables an employee who has been dismissed by the governors at the request of the local education authority under its statutory powers to treat the local education authority as the employer for the purposes of unfair dismissal. Section 117 also enables the local education authority to be placed in the position of the employer for the purposes of redundancy.<br><br>
Perhaps that is not unique, and there may be areas of employment where the same problem could arise, but the National Union of Teachers tells me that teachers are in this respect in a unique position, which inevitably gives rise to anomalies because statutory provisions will apply in the case of the direct employees of the managers or governors different from those relating to the employees of the local education authority working in the same establishment. The amendment is designed to remove that anomaly.<br><br>
It might save a bit of the Committee's time if I explain that exactly the same arguments apply in respect of amendment No. 93. I shall put matters simply and succinctly. A teacher could be dismissed from a new small aided school, perhaps for being pregnant, and she would have no protection under the provisions, whereas the caretaker at the same school who also
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1002</span>
might be pregnant would have protection under the Act. Clearly, that is anomalous and wrong, and the amendment has been designed to avoid it.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
I turn to new clause 3. At present section 117 provides that an employee who is paid by a person other than his employer may make a claim for redundancy payment against that person who is responsible for payment of salary or wages. When, however, the employee has transferred from the employment of one person to another, continuity of employment is broken despite the fact that salary or wages remain payable by the same person.<br><br>
Again, there is an example in teaching when the teacher is first employed by the local education authority and becomes employed by the managers or governors of an aided school within the area of the same authority. If subsequently he is made redundant from his aided school employment, he has only that redundancy payment calculated on the basis of his service in the aided school. The redundancy payment is similarly limited in the event of a move out of aided school employment into employment with the local education authority, and, indeed, in the case of a move from one aided school to another. In all those circumstances the teacher's salary derives from the same source.<br><br>
The amendment may have wider relevance. When one person remains the person responsible for the payment of salary of an employee despite technical changes of employer, surely there should be deemed to be continuity of employment throughout the period in which pay derives from the same source.<br><br>
I come next to new clause 4. Paragraph 9 of schedule 13 to the I978 Act at present provides that the continuity of employment of an employee for the purposes of qualifying the statutory rights which depend upon continuity is not broken by certain periods in which no contract of employment subsists. Those include temporary cessations of work and periods in which by custom and practice the employee is deemed still to be in his employer's employment. However, the employment appeal tribunal decided in a precedent case that where there are two separate and distinct contracts broken by more than a week continuity is broken.<br><br>
An illustration of this type of case is when a teacher is employed as a supply
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1040">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1003</span>
teacher for a full term and is then again employed on the same basis in subsequent terms. This was the case at issue before the employment appeal tribunal, when the supply teacher concerned had been employed on a daily paid supply basis for eight years yet was held not to have continuous employment.<br><br>
Such employees, whether part-time or full-time, regard their employment as effectively a permanent employment. However, when their contracts are not renewed they have at present no entitlement to a redundancy payment and, in the main, also no entitlement to protection against unfair dismissal now that the qualifying period of continuous employment has been increased. The employment tribunal's decision has been criticised as incorrect, but it stands as a precedent and there is a need for the law to be clarified on this question.<br><br>
The new clauses following new clause No. 7 are consequential, so I shall speak only to that clause. As a result of a recent Court of Appeal decision, a contract which at its outset does not set the date on which it will expire is not a fixed-term contract and, therefore, in the event that it expires without renewal, the non-renewal will not amount to dismissal. A number of employment protection provisions depend on the fact of dismissal.<br><br>
The case involved a lecturer who was appointed under a contract about which it could have been said that the date of its expiry was uncertain at the time when the contract was made—for example, the date on which the lecturer's classes might finish. That date was not known by the employer until students' examination dates were fixed halfway through the academic year. The case of the lecturer was won on other grounds, but it would have been lost if the court had decided that her contract was made to expire on a date which was uncertain at the time it was made.<br><br>
That decision, if not altered by statute, could result in a large number of employees in a variety of jobs being employed for a duration that was uncertain at the time when the contract was made but later made certain by a unilateral decision of the employer. They might thereby lose protection.<br><br>
The other new clauses are consequential.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on making a speech covering these complex matters in a way which was neither lengthy nor tedious as
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1004</span>
he warned us it might be. I shall try to reply with equal brevity.<br><br>
The effect of amendment No. 92 is to remove from the coverage of the new small firm exemption those employees who, by virtue of any statutory provision, are paid by the person other than their employer. Its effect is well exemplified by the illustration given of the teacher in a small Church of England aided school whose pay is provided by the local education authority but whose employer is the governing body of that school.<br><br>
The Government will certainly consider this amendment. I can well see the reason why it has been tabled. Speaking again unwisely for myself, I have some sympathy with the amendment. The theme which lies behind this part of the Bill, that of job generation, cannot really be served in this context. We are talking about a small village school exactly like the school in the village where I live. In that school there are about two-and-a-half teachers.<br><br>
Therefore I should like to consider the amendment, but I do so without commitment because, as the right hon. Gentleman will acknowledge, we have not had much notice or prior indication of the question. It is a complex matter which we need to consider carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope the hon. and learned Gentleman will be very cautious when he invokes prior indications.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope the right hon. Gentleman will not press me along those lines.<br><br>
Amendment No. 93 makes the same point in the case of reinstatement after maternity leave. The Government will consider this amendment, but this looks less promising. The theme that lies behind the Government's maternity reinstatement amendment to existing law is that it is very hard on the small employer to find a replacement for an employee prior to, and following, maternity and then have to get rid of that person in order to reinstate the original employee. That applies just as much in a small village school as it does in a small trading company. Therefore, although we shall consider the point, I see much greater objections in the way of acceding to amendment No. 93.<br><br>
We now come to new clauses 3, 4, 7, 5 and 6, which I shall take in order. New clause 3 would preserve continuity of employment for any employee whose pay-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1041">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1005</span>
master remained the same notwithstanding the change of employer. In particular, it would preserve continuity of employment for teachers moving between different aided schools in the same local authority.<br><br>
I am sympathetic to this proposal, too. The Government will consider it, but without commitment at this stage. Complex considerations arise. To provide continuity in these circumstances would be seen as special treatment, and there would be pressure to extend continuity to employees in other employment where their employer changes. The inclusion of
<br><blockquote><p>"by virtue of a contract of employment"</p></blockquote>
raises doubts on the limits of applicability of the provision. However, this deserves serious consideration, which the Government will give.<br><br>
The effect of new clause 4 is to give continuity of employment for up to 13 weeks, in the absence of a contract of employment, between periods where continuity of employment is secured under existing statutory provisions, provided the employee's normal work is not required in his undertaking. This would preserve continuity of employment for teachers during school holidays where the contract of employment did not subsist during that holiday. Here again, we are sympathetic, but the position is, I believe, covered by existing law and I doubt whether the new clause is necessary. The existing continuity provisions apply to that situation.<br><br>
However, I must again point out that there has not been any pressure—I choose a safer word—for this change. To put this in a slightly disparaging way, we do not see that the new clause would necessarily do any harm, and I am sympathetic to the motive that lies behind it. I cannot give a commitment, but it will be considered.<br><br>
On new clauses 5, 6, and 7, I have to take a different line. The effect of the new clauses—of which new clause 7 is the master—would be to amend section 142 of the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 so that an employer could engage an employee for a task which would be completed at an unspecified time, and this would be considered a fixed-term contract. The case of the lecturer referred to by the right hon. Gentleman is probably the case of Mrs. Guy v. Wiltshire county council. That, as he fairly allowed, was a case that was not lost by the complainant. But it might help the Committee
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1006</span>
if I sketched in the position on fixed-term contracts under present law.<br><br>
If one has a contract of employment with a fixed term of two years or more—that is, it comes to an end after two years, or later—and it is not renewed, that is deemed to be a dismissal and the dismissal can be claimed to be unfair. But there can be a waiver, with agreement, on the part of the employee of his right to redundancy payments and to his right to claim compensation for unfair dismissal. Clause 7 reduces that period from two years down to one year. That is the significance of a fixed-term contract.<br><br>
A contract to carry out a fixed task is clearly a different matter. One cannot know in advance how long the task will take. Existing law allows an engagement for a fixed task, but when that it is finished it is not deemed to be a dismissal if the engagement is not renewed. That is so under common law. Therefore, there is no right to complain of unfair dismissal.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
The new clauses 5, 6 and 7 treat fixed tasks as though they were for fixed terms. A contract to carry out a fixed task is treated as though it were a contract for a fixed term, giving rise to dismissal on non-renewal at the end of it when the task is completed, and therefore giving rise to the right to claim compensation for unfair dismissal.<br><br>
But that proposal contains a patent anomaly. Once the task is finished, how can it be deemed to be a dismissal in any from if the person is then not kept on? By definition the person is taken on to carry out a particular task—indexing the books in your library, for example, Mr. Goodhew. If I were taken on to carry out that task, when, no doubt after many years—although for the purpose of the argument we must assume that it is many months—that extensive task was complete, it would surely be straining the English language beyond any tolerable extent to say that there was a dismissal if, having indexed your library, I were not taken on in some further capacity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a gardener.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I might be better at that than at indexing the books.<br><br>
That is the distinction. I appreciate the fears expressed by the Association of University Teachers, for example, that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1042">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1007</span>
there may be cases in which employers seek to appoint for specific tasks rather than for fixed terms. Nevertheless, we believe that it would be extending the law far beyond what is either just or practicable to say that an employer who appointed somebody to carry out a specific task could be deemed to have dismissed that person when the task was complete at the end of some unspecified time, and thereafter could be made subject to a claim before an industrial tribunal for compensation for unfair dismissal. That cannot be right. I must therefore depart from the cooperative and sympathetic approach that I have been able, happily, to display on other proposals in this group and advise my hon. Friends to resist these three new clauses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the warm, helpful and—let us not be churlish—generous way in which the hon. and learned Gentleman has responded. Because he has been so encouraging, the NUT has scored more today than the Opposition have scored in the whole of our proceedings so far.<br><br>
I do not wish to seem ungrateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman but, while I do not intend to press the amendment, I must take the argument just a little further. I ask him to reflect a little longer, perhaps not today but when he is studying his law books again, on what he has just said about a contract which is set to expire with a particular event in time not being admissible as a fixed-term contract.<br><br>
Let us imagine that somebody is employed in the House of Commons Library for the duration of a Parliament. That Parliament terminates as a result of a vote of no confidence in the Government. History has precedents. The present Government may indeed find that, as a result of their policies, their assumed four to five years' tenure of office will turn out to be no more than a few months.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We may be getting some prior indications.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The person employed in the library for the duration of the present Parliament, having assumed that that would be four or five years, will suddenly find himself dismissed because the present Parliament has expired in a few months.<br><br>
I believe that that case should be arguable before a tribunal. That person may
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1008</span>
have made long-term plans on what may have seemed the quite reasonable assumption of a four or five-year job. When he finds that that is not the case, he may wish to argue before a tribunal that he has been dismissed. The hon. and learned Gentleman's comments rule out that possibility.<br><br>
The matter should not simply be swept aside. The hon. and learned Gentleman should consider the position not just of my hypothetical Library assistant but of many other people who may find themselves in a similar situation and who should have the right to argue before a tribunal that they have been dismissed. However, I have no wish to press the amendment at this stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman wish formally to move amendment No. 103?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not moved, Mr. Goodhew.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We come now to amendment No. 101.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 101, in page 9, line 19, leave out subsection (2).<br><br>
The amendment again deals with fixed-term contracts. I must tell the Committee that an hon. and learned Member of this House has written an enormously thick volume of guidance to employers about employment law. I turned up the passage dealing with fixed-term contracts in the hope of finding some stimulating and helpful advice. It was indeed stimulating. The guidance given to employers on fixed-term contract was simply "This is a tricky business. See your solicitor." Indeed, it is. It may seem simple, but I think that the little exchange between the hon. and learned Gentleman and myself illustrates the kind of difficulty that may arise.<br><br>
An enormous number of difficulties arise. I shall not go into case histories, much though I am tempted to do so, as I think that the Committee wishes to make progress. I shall therefore be brief. I do not suggest for one moment that the hon. and learned Gentleman has misunderstood
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1043">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1009</span>
the position or wanted to mislead the Committee, but it is important to spell out the present position.<br><br>
Under the present law, notwithstanding the fact that the parties have entered into a fixed-term contract, the expiry of that contract, if it happens within two years, is a dismissal. Hence, notwithstanding the fact that the contract has expired, if it is not renewed the employee may be able to argue that he has been unfairly dismissed.<br><br>
The Government propose to reduce that period from two years to one. The protection that exists at present for many people will therefore be much more limited in the number to whom it applies. In short, the Government are withdrawing a protection which exists at present from a possible large number of applicants. I do not know the numbers. Once again, the Government are narrowing and reducing the protections given by the Act. We should therefore resist that change.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The effect of clause 7(2) as it stands is relatively straightforward, which is a nice change. It restores the relationship established, when the concept of unfair dismissal was first introduced, between the qualifying period for making a complaint of unfair dismissal and the exemption from unfair dismissal in cases of non-renewal of what both parties recognise to be a genuine fixed-term contract.<br><br>
We are not changing the two-year limit to which the right hon. Gentleman has just referred on fixed-term contracts in which the right to a redundancy payment may be waived. This will remain in line with the provisions governing statutory redundancy payments which come into effect only after the employee has put in two years' service. This should make things much clearer for employers, as the waiver provisions for unfair dismissal and redundancy payments will now be in line with the qualifying period in each case. That will be of particular assistance to small businesses, as it is easier to grasp.<br><br>
We are not changing section 142 to exempt dismissals during the term of a fixed-term contract. The normal unfair dismissal provisions will continue to apply in such cases. Nor are we exempting dismissals where a fixed-term contract is not renewed if the employee has not agreed to waive his rights.<br><br>
Employers at the moment are reluctant to offer fixed-term contracts of between
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1010</span>
one and two years because they feel that they will face a complaint of unfair dismissal if they do not renew the contract when it expires. It is true, of course, that if the employer has no further need for somebody to do the job in question, he can defend himself by saying that the dismissal was fair because it was based on redundancy—one of the OK reasons, as we have called them. However, that does not save him from the worry, the inconvenience and the cost of a tribunal case, and makes him fight shy of creating some jobs where there could be genuine fixed-term contracts.<br><br>
It has been said that there is a risk that this change would be abused. It is claimed that employers would offer a succession of fixed-term contracts to people who would e forced to accept them in order to get jobs. But the Government do not think, on balance that that is likely. It has been said in several commentaries on the Bill that the waiver provisions are seldom used. What is more, it would require considerable administrative effort for employers to operate such a system.<br><br>
There is, more commonly, a genuine need in areas, such as the academic and research fields, to make use of the provision because, for instance, of uncertainties about research grants. I suppose there may be occasional instances of abuse; I do not deny that. We have looked extremely carefully at ways of limiting the waiver provisions to contracts which are for a fixed term for such genuine reasons and reducing the scope for abuse, but we have not been able to light upon a suitable answer.<br><br>
I think that abuse is unlikely to occur on a great scale. On balance, we think that it is better to encourage employers to create jobs where there is scope for genuine fixed-term contracts which are recognised as such by both parties than to deter them with the prospect of a complaint of unfair dismissal if they do not renew a contract when it expires. We have taken seriously into account what the Association of University Teachers was kind enough to tell us, and we think that it would not be right to accept the amendment, though we understand why it has been put forward.</span></p>

I am not at all familiar with all the complexity of this part of the law. But as I understand it, the tribunal already has</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1012</span>
<p><i>pursuant to Standing Order No.</i> 48 (<i>Debate on clause or schedule standing part</i>) <i>and Standing Order No.</i> 65 (<i>Procedure in Standing Committees</i>), That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 11, Noes 8.</p>
<p>adequate powers to deal with, and adjust compensation in relation to, any matter in which it is held that because of the complainant's misconduct there are just grounds for reducing the amount of compensation paid to him. I am wondering why we need this additional provision which, on the face of it, does no more than reiterate the law as it stands, except that the wording is so general that it lays itself open to different interpretations.</p>
<p>The very use of the term "conduct" rather than "misconduct" in one of the grouped amendments suggests that the tribunal could reduce the compensation because it did not like the behaviour of the complainant during the course of the tribunal's proceedings. Its members might take objection to his behaviour and might have good grounds for doing so. But his behaviour during the tribunal proceedings is not a matter which should influence what happened during his employment.</p>
<p>The provision that the tribunal can take into account
<br><blockquote><p>"conduct, whether before or after the dismissal"</p></blockquote>
is puzzling and most worrying. What is it that a man can do after he has been dismissed that gives the employer more justification that he otherwise would have had for dismissing the man when he did?</p>
<p>On 3Ist March, an employer says "Joe Bloggs' work and everything that he does is pretty poor, so I will dismiss him." Joe
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1045">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1013</span>
Bloggs complains. The decision that was made on that date took into account things that had happened up to and including 31st March. How on earth can the employer be more or less justified in the action that he took on 31st March by something that the complainant did on 10th April? It seems to be a licence for capricious judgment.<br><br>
I do not say that tribunals behave capriciously. But tribunals, like Standing Committees of this House, are made up of human beings, and human beings have natural instincts and nature reactions. I have known occupants of the Chair at our Committees who sometimes find it difficult to disguise their irritation with an hon. Member who, in the Chair's view, is not behaving reasonably or well. The same could happen to the chairman of a tribunal. But if that happens several months or weeks, or even three days, after the dismissal, it cannot by any means give greater, or less, justification for the act of dismissal and therefore, greater, or less, validity to a claim by a complainant. We would therefore like the hon. and learned Gentleman to tell the Committee what all this is about, because, on the face of it, it is slightly malodorous.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may help if I say a word or two about the basic award and the way in which clause 8 affects it. As the Committee will remember, compensation for unfair dismissal can be in three layers: compensation for the basic award, which is simply a mathematical calculation based on age and length of service; a compensatory award based on future loss of earnings; and an additional compensatory award if an order for compensation is not complied with. Those are the three layers of the cake. We are concerned only with the bottom layer, the basic award, which is calculated mathematically on a combination of age and length of service.<br><br>
The basic award is payable automatically upon any finding of unfair dismissal. The amount is calculated according to age and length of service. The basic award can be reduced, however, in cases where the tribunal finds that the complainant has contributed to his dismissal, but, currently, it cannot be reduced below two weeks' pay, nor can it be reduced if the employee has failed to mitigate his loss, or if misconduct on the part 6f the employee is discovered after dismissal.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1014</span>
As we said in our working paper, we do not think it right that an employee who is found to have been unfairly dismissed should automatically be paid a minimum of two weeks' pay, however heinous his misconduct, and however much he may have contributed to his own dismissal. We feel that the two weeks' pay—which in the case of the small employer, say a small shopkeeper in a village, for example, running the shop himself with all the difficulties that he now faces and with a single employee, as it may be—is a substantial burden. We do not see why a basic award of two weeks' pay should be payable in all instances after a finding of unfair dismissal. That is what clause 8 is designed to remedy.<br><br>
The amendment to section 73(3) of the 1978 Act is mainly technical. It corrects the mistake in the drafting of the formula for calculating the basic award. Under the present formula, only years of service during the whole of which the employee was either below or above 41 or 22 years of age, may be counted in the computation of his basic award. The effect of this is to deprive the employee of the credits of those years of service, which straddle his 41st or 22nd birthday and which are not, therefore, whole years during which he was either above or below 41 or 22. It is difficult to get hold of, but perhaps the Committee will be content to read what I have said and accept that this is a technical part of the amendment.<br><br>
Paragraph (<i>c</i>) also has the effect of providing for an employee who is below the age of 18 but above the age of 16 to receive an award calculated according to length of service. The position of this age group, curiously enough, is uncertain under the current provisions of the Act. It is unclear whether they are entitled to the two weeks' minimum provision that we are repealing. It seems sensible to clarify their position.<br><br>
To provide that employees under 18 could receive half a week's pay for each year of service seems appropriate in the light of the general principle that employees should receive a basic award dependent upon age and length of service. Those two issues are not controversial. I appreciate that they have not been touched on by the hon. Gentleman, though I thought it important to put on the record the reason for their inclusion in the clause.<br><br>
Subsections (4) and (5) of the clause deal with our main policy amendments to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1046">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1015</span>
the basic award provisions. They alter the conditions of entitlement to a full basic award and they do away with the irreducible minimum of two weeks. We are well aware of the justification for having a basic award for unfair dismissal. The unfairly dismissed employee should receive compensation for the loss of his job, just as the redundant employee does. We are not attacking that concept.<br><br>
Most employees will continue to receive their full basic award, but there are certain circumstances in which the employee's actions have been such that it is simply not right that his employer should have to pay him the full basic award. That is recognised in the current provision for deduction from the basic award where the employee is judged to have contributed to his dismissal.<br><br>
Therefore, we propose to cater for two further types of circumstances which will not arise very often, but which have arisen in the past and demonstrated that the current provision can produce an unfair result. In subsection (4) we provide for the reduction of the basic award by an amount that the tribunal considers just and equitable where the employee has unreasonably refused an offer of reinstatement.<br><br>
Somebody may have been unfairly dismissed, and, that finding having been made, he may immediately be offered reinstatement and a promise that bygones shall be bygones. If that offer is, in the opinion of the tribunal that ultimately hears the case, unreasonably rejected, we do not see any reason why the minimum should nonetheless be receivable by way of the basic award. We think that the employee has to some extent forfeited his right to compensation for loss of that job. Surely, it is not fair to expect his employer, who has tried to put matters right, to pay a full basic award. Tribunals may reduce the award only where there has been an unreasonable refusal and, if the employee had good grounds for refusing reinstatement, his entitlement would be unaffected.<br><br>
The second ground which we think should be added is the reduction where there has been misconduct, whether before or after the dismissal—I now come to the hon. Gentleman's point—other than conduct contributing to the dismissal.<br><br>
I am not in the least enchanted with that part of the clause which would enable the tribunal to take into account conduct of the complainant after he has had the sack.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1016</span>
My common law instincts are offended by that. Although I understand why it has been included, I certainly undertake to reconsider that part of the clause. Whereas it is perfectly proper for the tribunal to be able to take into account—adversely to the employee if necessary—evidence of misconduct that came to light after the dismissal, and which was not known to the employer at the time that he gave the employee the sack, a different situation arises when the tribunal is empowered to take into account misconduct that was committed after the dismissal. Therefore, I am very sympathetic to what the hon. Gentleman said in that regard. I hope that that is enough for me to say on that part of the clause.<br><br>
That deals with amendment No. 108, but it does not dispose of the group of amendments. It is important that it should be possible to take into account conduct not known to the employer at the time when he dismisses the employee but which comes to light subsequently. Amendment 109 is concerned with that subject.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman said that amendments Nos. 109 and 115 paved the way for the points that he wished to make. The effect of those amendments, however, is to remove from the tribunal its discretion to reduce the basic award and to take account of conduct other than the misconduct that contributed to the dismissal. The amendments nullify the whole of subsection (4), particularly the second paragraph.<br><br>
The primary purpose of the provision is to meet the criticisms of the present basic award provisions made by Lord Diplock in the well known case of Davis v. Atkins. That case drew attention to what must be regarded on all sides as an anomaly. When dealing with the case, Lord Diplock said that the anomaly amounted to a rogue's charter.<br><br>
It was alleged during the case that the employer discovered after the dismissal that the employee had been guilty of fraud. The House of Lords upheld the tribunal's ruling that that fraud could not be taken into account in assessing contributory fault because it was not known to the employer at the time of the dismissal. The basic award provisions were not yet in force, but Lord Diplock drew attention to the fact that if they had been the tribunal would still have had no choice but to make
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1047">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1017</span>
a full basic award. If this had taken place, Lord Diplock said, the unfair dismissal compensation provisions would have been converted into a vertiable rogue's charter.<br><br>
The clause therefore empowers the tribunal to reduce the basic award in such cases as the Davis case. It further empowers the tribunal to reduce the award where misconduct has taken place while the employee is under notice of dismissal, or after he has left the firm. On the latter point, I have already indicated that I am greatly in sympathy with the hon. Gentleman. I hope that I have adequately explained the purpose of the provisions which are the subject of the group of amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that we should be grateful for what the hon. and learned Gentleman has said about the amendment that deals with the proposed power of the tribunal to take into account an ex-employee's behaviour after his dismissal. However, I wonder whether the hon. and learned Gentleman would spell out a little more sharply the degree to which he has accepted my hon. Friend's argument and the amendment. I was interested by his reference to the well known Davis v. Atkins case.<br><br>
I make no apology for referring yet again in the Committee to the splendid briefing that we all get from the Industrial Relations Services bulletin. That makes reference to the Davis v. Atkins case as well. It describes that case in terms similar to those used by the hon. and learned Gentleman, and it goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government's Bill, however, would seem to go much further than dealing with the Davis v. Atkins situation."</p></blockquote>
The bulletin goes on to make clear that the Bill goes further in the respect to which I previously referred. Even the hon. and learned Gentleman said that that provision offends his common law sensibilities, or whatever. However, he stopped somewhat short of giving us a firm assurance, for which we are entitled to ask, about a change in that provision.<br><br>
To reinforce the point that has already been made, I shall quote what the Industrial Relations Service bulletin says next:
<br><blockquote><p>"The award may be reduced not just where conduct before dismissal comes to light after dismissal but in respect of conduct which actually takes place after the employee is dismissed. This is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1018</span>
a quite extraordinary proposition which appears to impose a duty of good behaviour on the ex-employee in relation to his former employer. It is totally out of keeping with the other principles relating to compensation"—</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It goes much wider than that. It does not, as the quotation implies, impose a duty on the man to behave properly only in relation to his former employer. It imposes on him an unqualified duty to behave properly. Nothing in the clause refers to conduct or misconduct in relation to the employer. It is very much wider than that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept what my hon. Friend says. However, I was quoting from the Industrial Relations Services bulletin, whose name I have invoked before. I assume that we all accept that that body is an independent, reliable, and authoritative source of impartial information to employers and others who are concerned with these matters and are professionally engaged in the field.<br><br>
Of course, my hon. Friend is quite right. Let us assume for a moment that someone has been dismissed because of some question of his integrity and has put in a claim that he has been unfairly dismissed. If those words remain in the Bill, one cannot rule out the possibility that he would have to beware of any behaviour in any respect that might cause further question or be used in evidence before the tribunal by the employer or his representatives. That would be hanging over him like the sword of Damocles. He would have to be constantly on his best behaviour so as not to give any opportunity for someone to whisper in the employer's ear about some misbehaviour that may perhaps be able to be used. That would be irrespective of whether the behaviour was in relation to the employer or even in the area of employment at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like a footballer who has been shown the yellow card.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The Industrial Relations Services bulletin goes on:
<br><blockquote><p>"For example, it is not at all clear that an employer is under any obligation to provide an employee with a reference after dismissal and the only way an employee could collect any compensation in respect of an employer's conduct after dismissal would be if he could establish actual financial loss resulting from that conduct."</p></blockquote>
That, too, goes rather beyond what we have been saying in support of the amend-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1048">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1019</span>
ment. I hope, therefore, that the hon. and learned Gentleman will give us a rather more concrete and specific commitment in response to the arguments put forward by my hon. Friend.<br><br>
I have one more point to make. Just before the hon. and learned Gentleman resumed his seat, he spoke about the passage in the Bill which would be affected by amendment No. 109. I am still rather puzzled about what that adds to section 73(7) of the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978. That provides:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where the tribunal finds that the dismissal was to any extent caused or contributed to by any action of the complainant it shall, except in a case where the dismissal was by reason of redundancy, reduce the amount of the basic award by such proportion as it considers just and equitable having regard to that finding."</p></blockquote>
I do not think that any of us would challenge that the tribunal should have that discretion and that that kind of conduct should be taken into account in determining compensation. I am at a loss to see how that provision is improved—or the degree to which it is changed or extended—by the provisions that our amendment seeks to fillet from the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I gladly give the right hon. Gentleman an assurance that I accept in principle amendment No. 108, which relates to conduct which occurred after dismissal. I accept that in principle. I should like to be able to accept it <i>in Toto,</i> but I cannot because there are certain</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 110, in page 9, leave out line 35.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 114, in page 10, line 18, leave out subsection (5).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These two amendments address themselves to the fact that the Government's legislation extinguishes altogether the basic award. What is the basic award? It is two weeks' pay.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1020</span>
<p>drafting deficiencies which make it unacceptable.</p>
<p>Amendment No. 109 is necessary because conduct before dismissal must relate to the job. It is most unlikely that a tribunal will take into account conduct unrelated to employment. It is therefore not sufficient to rely on the existing provisions in legislation. It is necessary that the clause should in this regard be drafted as we propose.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Over many years I have had too many experiences of Ministers' promises committing them to look at things between Committee and Report turning out to be pie-crust. But the way the hon. and learned Gentleman has treated the Committee gives one confidence that when he says something like that he means it. I am sure that he means it, and I am grateful to him. I do not think, however, that he has altogether met the points put to him by my right hon. Friend and me. I hope, therefore, that my right hon. and hon. Friends will join me in dividing the Committee on amendment No. 109. In the light of what the Under-Secretary has said, I shall not seek to press amendment No. 108. I look forward to hearing the result of his reconsideration.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i>—Ayes 7, Noes 11.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The minimum basic award.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The minimum basic award. We are concerned here with someone who has the traumatic experience of losing his job, for whatever reason, and who goes all through the tribunal procedure. His claim is upheld at the tribunal, yet he cannot get even the minimum two weeks' pay. Two weeks' pay is peanuts, but that is to be denied by the Government eve n if the complainant is found to have been unfairly dismissed.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1049">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1021</span>
That seems to conflict—to use the Under-Secretary's word—with the Government's concern for a man who loses his job through the closed shop.<br><br>
It is a fact that 73 percent. of the people who appealed to tribunals received only two weeks' pay, and 28 per cent. received less than £200. So we are not talking of large sums of money.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
It could be held that there was a balance of opinion about why a man was dismissed: the man could have contributed to his dismissal by his conduct, or there could be a contributory fault. But, as my right hon. Friend pointed out, the tribunals are already allowed to take account of that. Surely, however, it is not possible for anyone who has had an appeal for unfair dismissal upheld to be 100 per cent. at fault. If he was 100 per cent. at fault, his claim would not have been upheld by the tribunal. Therefore, we are not asking too much by saying that a man who has gone through the experience of losing his job, having been given the sack, and has gone to a tribunal, should get at least the minimum two weeks' pay.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The effect of the amendment is to delete from the clause that part which says that the minimum basic award can be whittled away. At present, whatever the conduct of the complainant or employee, once a finding of unfair dismissal has been made, the tribunal has no option but to award a minimum of two weeks' pay by way of basic award.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asks what we are talking about and says that the award is peanuts. It is not peanuts in terms of the number of times it is made. He gave a figure of 73 per cent. who received only the minimum of two weeks, but I have not checked the figure. That percentage receive the award on many occasions. But, as I indicated earlier, in these days when wages are, happily, so much higher than they used to be, two weeks' pay is a substantial amount. Consider my example on the last group of amendments of a small employer, a village shopkeeper. For such a person, to be faced with an award of two weeks' pay to an employee, bearing in mind the kind of margins on which these people so often have to operate, is a substantial burden.<br><br>
I have often had to consider cases in which the merits did not lie at all with the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1022</span>
complainant. It was deeply unjust. No doubt many of us in Committee have had similar examples.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asks how it can be that someone is wholly to blame. But there are cases, certainly at common law, where a person can contribute wholly to his own injury under the law of negligence. But it is now settled that under this jurisdiction of unfair dismissal under the Employment Protection Act, it is possible for there to be 100 per cent. contributory fault. It could happen, for example, where there was unfairness in the procedure leading to the dismissal but the tribunal considered that the employee's misconduct was so bad that, clearly, he would have been dismissed in any event and would be wholly to blame for such a dismissal.<br><br>
Therefore, it is important that where a tribunal considers it just and equitable that is the standard it has to apply right across the board—it should be possible to relieve the employer of having to pay two weeks' pay—or a part of it—in every case where a finding has been made.<br><br>
As I have shown, it is not unusual for a finding of unfair dismissal to be made solely on a technicality—on a breach of procedure, for example—but the court or tribunal wishes to mark its view of where justice and equity lie by refusing any compensation. There may not be many cases when the figure would be absolutely nil, but the amounts involved are not peanuts to those who are providing employment, albeit on a very small scale, in each of those cases. That is why I must advise the Committee to vote against the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman said that he had constituency cases in which the merits did not lie with the complainant. In that instance I should not have thought that the industrial tribunal would have sustained the complainant's case.<br><br>
We are talking about a man who wins his case and is given not even two weeks' pay—indeed, he receives virtually nothing. That is an absurdity, and I hope that it offends the common law susceptibilities of the right hon. and learned Gentleman that someone can win a case and not receive a penny. It reduces the law to absurdity.<br><br>
We recently talked about Members of the House who were dismissed—fairly—by the electorate. It was said that three

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1023</span>
months' pay was not enough: Indeed, the majority view was that six months' money would be justified. If the hon. and learned Gentleman were suddenly dismissed and his appeal were upheld—even though he had contributed to that dismissal a little by not observing the prior indications, or whether there had been a small or even a large contributory fault—and he did not receive at least two weeks' pay, he would</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 111, in page 9, line 36, leave out subsection (3).<br><br>
The subsection seems to me no more than a piece of petty meanness. As I read it, it reduces the compensation that can be awarded to young people. For the life of me, I do not see the logic in that, and especially in fixing the age of 22. Many people are married and even have the beginnings of a family at that age. I see no reason whatever why the damage that someone has suffered through a dismissal is any less before his 22nd birthday than it is after that.<br><br>
I was puzzled when I saw the provision, and I still am. I should like to ask the hon. and learned Gentleman—I put the point in interrogative form—to explain the provision to me and to state why on earth the Government want it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I gladly respond to that. As I stated, it is a technical amendment which takes account of a mistake that was made in the drafting of the formula for calculating the basic award in the 1975 Act which was consolidated into the 1978 Act. I must correct the hon. Gentleman's statements, which was more of an interrogatory, in which he asked whether the provision had the effect of reducing the amount of a young person's compensation. The matter is rather technical, but as I have been asked about it I think that I should let fly with the full explanation so that it is on record.<br><br>
Under section 73(3) of the 1978 Act, the</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1024</span>
<p>consider himself unfairly done by. I believe that this is a mean and petty attitude that pushes matters too far, and I should not like to see it written into our law.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 8, Noes 11.</p>
<p>basic award is calculated by reckoning the number of years of continuous employment falling within the specified period. It allows one and a half weeks' pay for each year of employment which consists wholly of weeks in which the employee was not below the age of 41, one week's pay for each year of employment which consists wholly of weeks in which the employee was below the age of 41 but not under 22—that is probably the category into which the hon. Gentleman falls—and half a week's pay for each year of employment which consists wholly of weeks in which the employee was below the age of 22 and not under 18.</p>
<p>That has been the formula since the Employment Protection Act of 1975. The effect is to exclude from the computation of the employee's years of service—and therefore to deprive him of the credit for them—the years straddling his 41st or his 22nd birthdays, as only years of service during the whole of which the employee was either above or below 41 or 22 should be counted.</p>
<p>The formula in schedule 4 to the Act for the calculation of redundancy payments—not for unfair dismissal—with which that for working out the basic was intended to be analagous is not defective in the same way. In other words, he does not lose out in respect of the years that straddle the relevant birthdays.</p>
<p>Schedule 4 provides that the amount of a redundancy payment is calculated by reckoning the number of years of continuous employment falling within the specified period and allowing one and a half weeks' pay, and so on. In other words,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1051">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1025</span>
the distinction is that of continuous employment.</p>
<p>Paragraph (<i>c</i>) has the effect of providing for employees below the age of 18 to receive an award calculated according to their length of service. As I have said, under existing law their position is uncertain. We are making completely certain that those between 16 and 18 have an entitlement for compensation when a finding of unfair dismissal is made in their favour.</p>
<p>The current position of those under 18 regarding the basic award is somewhat uncertain because they are not specifically provided for in the legislation. I shall not set out the various arguments on the matter because that would be tedious. But we seek to make it plain that they have an entitlement. I indicated earlier the basis for those calculations.</p>
<p>That is why the portion of the clause which is the subject of the amendment corrects a mistake in the drafting of the formula. Therefore, I believe that I was entitled to describe it as technical. I do not criticise the hon. Gentleman or anyone else who comes to the wrong conclusion on being faced with technical drafting of this nature and does not immediately twig the purpose of it. But I believe that it is set out in the explanatory notes, and I give the Committee my assurance that that is what it achieves.</p>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to the hon. and learned Gentleman. He is absolutely right in saying that I had not understood the technicalities. I doubt whether any other hon. Member did, and we must be grateful to him for spelling them out.<br><br>
I still think this is a petty meanness. If it is perpetuating something that has been done over the past few years, and which was brought in by a different Government, that does not alter the position. This Government might well have taken the opportunity of rectifying it. But I suppose that is too much to ask.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not fair to describe this as a petty meanness. The effect of the formula at the moment is that it excludes from the computation of the employee's years of service, and hence deprives him of the credit for them, the years straddling his 41st or his 42nd birthday. That is put right.

Instead of being mean about it, we are enabling him to get more credit for the computation of his basic award which is calculated on a combination of age and years of service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman is right so long as one has the two cut-off points of 41 and 22. Of course, the hon. and learned Gentleman is right in saying that that is not disadvantageous. When I said that we could have got rid of the petty meanness, I meant that we could have dispensed with the lower cut-off point altogether.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We cannot let this clause go by without comment. Let me first recall why the basic award was introduced in the 1975 Act. It was given, following a commitment to do so, during the passage of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974. At that time it reflected the then Government's concern at the generally low level of compensation awards made under the unfair dismissal provisions introduced in the Industrial Relations Act.<br><br>
At that time, in 1974, more than 60 per cent. of compensation awards were for less than £300. I do not know whether the position has changed significantly since then, or whether, making due allowance for inflation, the real value of such awards is the same. We envisaged then that the basic award would rest on two basic principles. First, the principle that an employee who had been unfairly dismissed should not receive less compensation than that to which he would, if eligible, have been entitled under the Redundancy Payments Act, if fairly selected for redundancy. Secondly, the principle that every employee who had been unfairly dismissed should receive a minimum of two weeks' pay as compensation for elements of loss which were not readily quantifiable, such as damage to his reputation or career.<br><br>
The point was well made by my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton). He described the absurdity of a man having a tribunal uphold his complaint of unfair dismissal yet coming away empty handed with nothing to mark the fact that he had succeeded in his claim.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1052">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1027</span>
We all know that there are many employers who still regard with some reserve and caution an employee who, notwithstanding the fact that he had won his case, had taken the trouble to go to a tribunal. It was from recognition that there are more things in life than are reflected in the pay packet at the end of the week that the basic award was introduced to ensure that even though a person might not have suffered financially, there would have been damage to his reputation or career.<br><br>
It is true that the Conservatives opposed it. They argued that it was rare in British law for compensation to be awarded for unquantifiable factors. But we argued that unfair dismissal was an extremely serious event in the life of an employee and that compensation for loss would in itself often be an inadequate remedy. I need not remind the Committee yet again of what the Royal Commission said about the impact of unfair dismissal on the life of a working man. It was described in many cases as a disaster.<br><br>
Therefore, the rationale of the compensation provisions of the employment protection legislation was that unfair dismissal was such a serious event that compensation based on financial loss was often an inadequate remedy, and that unquantifiable factors such as damage to reputation needed to be taken into account in any assessment of the damage suffered by an employee.<br><br>
The Bill starts to retreat from that understanding. It resiles from the proposition. One of my anxieties is that, having set off on this road, the Government will be tempted to go further and further along it. We have seen the salami tactics that the Government are already employing generally in this sphere. Having learned from the Industrial Relations Act, rather than introduce a comprehensive package, the step-by-step approach is preferred. Thus it is described by the Secretary of State. I often wonder where those steps are taking us. The step-by-step, salami tactics may be employed in the particular as in their general approach. That is what causes me anxiety.<br><br>
But more important is the fact that yet again we have a part of the Bill which was supposed to have been introduced to deal, first, with the problems of industrial relations and, secondly, with the repeated complaints of employers who own small businesses. But this part of the Bill seems to owe nothing to either of those considera-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1028</span>
tions. It does not extend any particular benefit to small employers. It seems to have nothing to do with industrial relations except that it will be one more little irritant that will not help the wheels of industry to turn any more smoothly. It is a little more grit in the mechanism where a little bit of oil might be more appropriate.<br><br>
It is for that reason I ask my hon. Friends to divide the Committee and oppose the inclusion of this clause in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was surprised to hear the right hon. Gentleman conclude his remarks by saying that there was nothing in this part of the Bill that offered any help to small employers. It is on the small employer that the liability to pay a minimum basic award of two weeks' pay weighs the heaviest. For the big employer, as the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) said, it could amount to peanuts. For the small employer, it is far from being peanuts. As we all know, there are many millions of people whose livelihoods depend upon having employment with small employers. The small business sector is enormously important, both numerically and in terms of the jobs which it maintains and its job creation potential.<br><br>
Every one of us in the Committee has learnt from constituents who are small business people that one of the deterrents, the sort of thing they have in their minds as an element of injustice, or evidence of the injustice of the employment protection legislation, is that no matter what the circumstances may be, if a person gets a finding of unfair dismissal in his favour one still has to pay a minimum of two weeks' pay.<br><br>
The basic award is calculated by a combination of age and length of service. Even though his length of service does not qualify him for that, he still gets two weeks' pay. It is that, coupled with other things, such as the belief that one is guilty until one proves oneself innocent—the burden of proof point—that builds up to a great disincentive to take on more people than is absolutely necessary, or to expand or to start new businesses. This crops up time and again in our postbags, in our surgeries and in our ordinary converse in our constituencies. The right hon. Gentleman says that there is nothing in this part of the Bill to benefit small businesses. Most unusually for him, that point was badly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1053">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1029</span>
taken. It is here, above all, that the need is greatest in the small business sector.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. and learned Gentleman is misrepresenting me, but I must insist on qualifying slightly what he has just attributed to me. I said that there was nothing that would help small firms "in particular".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are talking of people losing their employment and having appealed successfully to a tribunal on grounds of unfair dismissal. If somebody loses his job as a result of losing his union card—that is to say, by being expelled from a closed shop—does the hon. and learned Gentleman think that the same desiderata should apply, that there should be no minimum and that less than two weeks' pay would be all right in those circumstances?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In clause 3, which relates to that point, there is no parallel stipulation that there shall be a minimum award. The hon. Gentleman therefore makes the point himself. I believe that the criteria to be applied by the employment appeal tribunal are those of "just and equitable". The tribunal would certainly have the power to say "we see that you have your declaration and that you have not been taken back, but the question now is whether you have suffered any loss of earning capacity." By the time the case comes before the tribunal, the person may have found a better job and not be suffering any future loss. It would therefore be open to the tribunal to say that he is not entitled to anything, or to make a derisory award. The point is therefore made against the hon. Gentleman. If we were guilty of double standards, we should have put in some provision for a statutory minimum.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly agreed do.</i></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1030</span>
<p>I agree that the basis, which I thought was an all-party basis, for having a basic award was that where a person lost his job an element fell to be compensated other than strict loss of earnings. The whole point of the clause is that it is just and equitable, when an award has been made to somebody for unfair dismissal—perhaps on a technicality or some unfairness in the procedure leading up to his dismissal, as in the illustration I gave—when all the circumstances, including his conduct, are taken into account, he ought not to receive any money by way of compensation.</p>
<p>The award may be reduced to nil if a reasonable offer of reinstatement is refused. What is wrong with that? We have all come across cases where there is a sudden row on the shop floor and somebody is sacked. That is unfair dismissal. But tempers then cool, reason resumes its seat, as they said in the old cases, and matters are put right. The slate is wiped clean, and the person is invited to come back and to let bygones be bygones. If a reasonable offer of reinstatement is unreasonably rejected, why should there be an obligation to pay two weeks' wages as a basic award? That really defies reason.</p>
<p>I shall not weary the Committee with the point about which we have spent most of our time arguing, namely if the worker's conduct warrants it. Nor should we forget the provision which allows the years at work between the ages of 16 and 18 to count for the purposes of unfair dismissal. Nothing has been said about that part of the clause.</p>
<p>All in all, I believe that the principle of the clause is absolutely right and that it should stand part of the Bill. I hope that my hon. Friends will therefore vote accordingly.</p>

CONTRIBUTION IN RESPECT OF COMPENSATION</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 118, in page 10, line 26, after "person", insert "in his employment".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 119, in page 10, line 29, after "so", insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"other than a strike or other industrial action which did not involve any breach of the contracts of employment of the employees concerned ".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 121, in page 10, line 32, leave out from first "union" to end of line 32 and insert "whatsoever".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The first two of these amendments may reasonably be described as probing amendments. I notice that the paragraph on joinder in the consultative document was rather more limited than the clause as it eventually appeared. The consultative document said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Because in cases of dismissal in closed shops union pressures may cause the dismissal, there would seem to be a strong case for enabling the employer, if he chooses, to join a union in any case brought against him. It would then be open to the tribunal in such cases to apportion any compensation payable between the employer and the union as it thought appropriate."</p></blockquote>
The clause as it appears in the Bill goes wider than that and refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"a trade union or other person".</p></blockquote>
The first of the amendments seeks to probe the meaning and effect of "other person". I assume that it could include the individual trade union official—a lay or a full-time official—as well as the trade union itself.<br><br>
I assume that the clause as it now stands is intended to deal with secondary action. I am not quite clear about that, but that is how it appears. If that is the case, bearing in mind that it did not appear in that form in the consultative document, I am a little surprised that it appears here. I cannot help but wonder whether the provision would have been better left to a later date. We are told that in due course there is to be a Green Paper on immunities. Might that not have been a better context in which to introduce the idea?<br><br>
I seek clarification from the hon. and learned Gentleman on another matter. The question has been raised by the TUC.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1032</span>
Will the co-defendants, whoever they may be, have the right to appear before an industrial tribunal to argue that the dismissal in which they were involved was fair and reasonable? Will a right for them to appear be built in?<br><br>
Those questions flow from our first amendment, although I must admit that the wording of that is slightly at fault. If we were to persist with it, I think that the word "other" would have to come out of the clause as well. Otherwise we should be talking in terms of trade unions being employed by the employer. Of course, that is not what was intended. However, it would be a mere drafting alteration.<br><br>
The second amendment is largely self-explanatory. However, it could give rise to much discussion about when a strike, a work to rule or other action would actually be in breach of an employment contract. Trade unionists usually believe that there is no breach so long as notice is given, although in law that often tends not to be the case. It would be helpful to hear some wise words of explanation from the hon. and learned Gentleman on that.<br><br>
The third amendment is more substantial. It takes us back to the kind of arguments that we have had on earlier clauses. It would limit the liability of the union or its officials to cases where industrial action was aimed against non-unionists rather than against members of particular unions.<br><br>
If the clause stays in its present form industrial tribunals and appeal courts would inevitably have to judge the merits of unions' claims that particular workers should belong to union A rather than to union B. Again, we would submit that such matters are best dealt with by voluntary inter-union agreements. That takes us back to the TUC procedures, particularly the Bridlington disputes principles and procedures.<br><br>
The clause is yet another nail in the coffin of Bridlington. This process has been going on throughout our discussions in Committee as clause after clause has been approved by means of the Government's majority. Bridlington has been consistently undermined in that way. If our amendment is not made the operation of those procedures will be overtaken by a whole set of legal judgments about when it may be just or equitable for a union to put pressure on an employer to get rid of a worker who refuses to abide by inter-union resolution of disputes through existing procedures.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1055">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1033</span>
One suspects that good employers would generally tend to support an amendment of the kind that we have proposed. Good employers would feel that such an amendment would make for better, more tolerable industrial relations within their undertakings.<br><br>
I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman for explanation particularly on the points that I have raised on the first two amendments. I also stress that we are especially concerned about the third amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may help if I begin by explaining the function of the clause. Then I shall deal with the questions arising out of the amendments. The clause adds a new section, section 76A, to the unfair dismissal provisions of the 1978 Act. In the circumstances described, a union or an individual may be joined as a party by the employer in certain unfair dismissal cases.<br><br>
The guts of the new section are in subsection (1), which enables an employer defending an unfair dismissal claim to join as a party in the proceedings a trade union or other person whom he claims induced him to dismiss the employee by industrial pressure exercised because the employee was not a union member.<br><br>
Subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) defines such industrial pressure in the same terms as does section 63 of the 1978 Act, namely,
<br><blockquote><p>"calling, organising, procuring or financing…industrial action or threatening to do so".</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 118 would have the effect that an employer could join in proceedings only a trade union or other person in his employment. The hon. has fairly acknowledged that the drafting is defective; that is no matter. As drafted, the Bill would allow a trade union or any other person to be joined in proceedings.<br><br>
The first matter on which I was asked to comment was the contrast between the wording in the working paper, which made provision for an employer joining a union in any case brought against him, and the Bill, which specifies
<br><blockquote><p>"a trade union or other person".</p></blockquote>
I was asked to explain that. The reason for the change is that not every example of pressure being brought to bear by way of industrial action upon an employer to dismiss someone for not being a member of a union stems from official action. Where it is official action, the wording of the working paper would be sufficient.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1034</span>
However, where the action is unofficial the right to join a trade union that is not responsible for what is taking place would be of no avail to the employer.<br><br>
The important belief behind the clause is widely held. An employer may have got rid of someone against his will because, figuratively speaking, his arm has been twisted and he has been told "Look, we are going to bring your place to a halt unless you get rid of this person who refuses to join the union." The practicalities of economic life mean that often employers feel obliged to accede to such demands. Then, of course, they are taken to the cleaners for unfair dismissal.<br><br>
Justice requires that an employer should be able to say to the tribunal that he took the action only because the trade union forced him to. It is just that those responsible should be brought in to defend their part in the proceedings. At the end of the day, having heard all the evidence, the tribunal should have the opportunity to divide the responsibility as seems just and equitable.<br><br>
As the hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) will know, that is a direct parallel of the third-party proceedings in civil law. If one is made the defendant in an action for negligence because it is said that one has run into the plaintiff's motor car, one is entitled to say "I know that my car came into contact with his, but that was only because of the extraordinarily bad driving of a bus which forced me across the road. I want the bus driver, or the bus company, to be brought in as a third party." The court, hearing all the evidence at one and the same time, can make up its own mind where the responsibility lies, and in what proportion. That is what is behind the clause.<br><br>
6.45 pm<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asks, why put in "any other person". That is in order to deal with a case where industrial pressure has been brought to bear that is no less effective for being unofficial but is unofficial nevertheless. It is thought here that the right to join should extend to somebody who is responsible—a group of people perhaps, or a branch, but not the union itself. If the claim by the employer fails, so be it. The tribunal can make whatever order it thinks just. It is very hard to argue against that principle, and we think that it is abundantly clear.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman askes whether it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1056">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1035</span>
intended that the trade union or the other person should be able to turn up and defend himself at the tribunal. The answer is "Yes, of course", and in the same way as in a civil court. Someone who has been brought in as a third party has the same rights as the defendant to the action. It would be impossible if he or the trade union were not able in such circumstances to give their side of the story.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman assumed that this was intended only to deal with secondary action, but that is certainly not so. It is intended to deal with primary as well as secondary action. I would judge that it is much more likely to arise over primary action than over secondary action. It is intended to enable anyone who is obliged to get rid of somebody against whom he has no quarrel, who has served him in whatever capacity quite satisfactorily under the terms of his employment, because he has not joined a union, to have some redress so that he can say "Sort out the real merits of this case."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let us assume that pressure is brought on an employer to dismiss someone in these circumstances, the expelled member goes to an industrial tribunal, his appeal is upheld and the union accepts that but the people with whom he works say that, regardless of what the tribunal and the union said, they will not work with him. The employer still wishes his business to continue and decides, on balance, that he wants the 99.9 per cent. rather than the single individual. Who would then be responsible for damages?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is dangerous to answer examples definitely when they are just put across the table like that. In the circumstances the hon. Gentleman mentions, the workman already has his finding of unfair dismissal. He has been dismissed and has gone to the tribunal, which says that his dismissal was unfair, whereupon the union says "Oh, very well." I am not sure where that leaves us. He is still none the less dismissed, and he then has a claim for unfair dismissal against his employer. He is therefore immediately and automatically entitled to his basic compensation award on the basis of age and length of service. In such circumstances, plainly the employer would be entitled to join the union and say "I did this only because the union made me do it."<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1036</span>
The difficulty would arise over a compensatory award when it came to the question of how much loss of future earnings had been sustained. That would be a different matter and an interesting case, because the union would say "You cannot blame us because we have said that we are prepared to take him back, and the only reason he is not back at work is that other people have said that they will not wear it." I would guess that the union would have a good answer to a claim to be joined in a compensatory award—it would say what I have just indicated—but it would not have any answer if the employer said that it ought to pay its share—I should have thought that it would be 100 per cent.—of the basic award for that reason. But these are all matters that are sorted out by tribunals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. and learned Gentleman saying that even though the union has told its members that they should behave in accordance with the tribunal's decision and the members then say "No, we are not prepared to work with this chap", the union should still be responsible and have to pay compensation? There could be a dilemma if it had to be individual workers. Heaven knows how one levies compensation on a lot of people. Clearly, there is a practical difficulty. But, equally, it would seem extremely unjust if a union had done all that it could. It may even have taken disciplinary action but there is still a refusal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I prefer to look at it, as we are considering injustice, from the point of view of the man who has lost his job not because of anything he has done wrong in his job but because the union has said "We want that man out." If the union is going to cavil at the prospect of being made liable for compensation and for the basic award, it should think of that before taking the action.<br><br>
The basic award is an automatic consequence of having been unfairly dismissed. Who secured the dismissal? Answer: the trade union. Therefore, it is difficult to argue against making the trade union liable to pay the compensation of the basic award.<br><br>
When it comes to future loss of earnings, the tribunal has to ask: "What is the future for this man? will he get another job? Let us assume for the purposes of argument that he will not for a while.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1057">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1037</span>
Therefore, he will clock up loss of earnings for the next three or four months." The union would then probably be entitled to say "It is not our fault. It is the fault of these guys who are doing something that we told them not to do. Therefore, we ought to be relieved of any responsibility for the compensatory award as distinct from the basic award." That would probably be a quite reasonable line to take.<br><br>
It would be for the tribunal to decide whether the employer had to bear that on his own. He probably would. I do not know. It would not be realistic in practical terms to suggest that he then ought to join his employees who were taking the action. Nobody in real life would to that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So the chap does not get justice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is true. But one seldom get justice if one is sacked because one's employer's arm has been twisted by a union to which one does not belong and does not wish to belong. I hope that that will be borne in mind.<br><br>
No one can ever construct a system of law and tribunals which will provide an absolutely watertight bulwark against injustice. All one can do is try. It is because we are trying that since 1975 there has been a system of employment protection whereby somebody can get damages or compensation for losing his job over and above what the common law or his terms of his contract give him.<br><br>
But it has become apparent that that can work in an unjust way, in the circumstances we are discussing, where someone is unfairly dismissed not because the employer want to sack him but because the union has, in effect, made him do so. It is unjust if in those circumstances the employer is then taken to the cleaners for what may be a substantial amount of money by way of compensation for unfair dismissal.<br><br>
We come now to amendment No. 121. I have answered those probing amendments, having been enticed into some interesting paths, if not avenues, by the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton).<br><br>
Amendment No. 121 has the effect of excluding pressure to dismiss because an employee was not a member of a particular union rather than any union whatever. I must explain why the Government must
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1038</span>
reject the amendment. In many more cases, the pressure brought upon an employer is to dismiss the chap because he is not a member of a particular recognised union. It is not unheard of, obviously, but I would have thought it much more unusual for somebody to be pressed to dismiss his worker because he is not a member of any union than because he is not a member of the particular union which has massive representation in the factory and is recognised for collective bargaining purposes.<br><br>
To delete the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"of a particular trade union"</p></blockquote>
would give rise to the most glaring and unassailable anomaly and go far towards undermining the real benefit of the clause, which is to provide a measure of justice for an employer in the circumstances we are discussing. I hope that that deals with the points that have been raised. I invite my hon. Friends to vote against the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman said that he had been enticed up some interesting paths. I am afraid that when he reached the end of one of them he fell into a bog, and one of his own making. I put it to the hon. and learned Gentleman in all friendliness and I mean that—that he has travelled over dangerous ground in some of what he has said. I believe that some of that can be read as an incitement to unofficial action by workers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will all be unofficial.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend says, it will all be unofficial. The hon. and learned Gentleman used the phrase "The person concerned ought to be joined." He cited the example of when a union might say "We have no objection to this chap", but he may be working with 30 others who say with one voice that they do not care whether the union is prepared to admit him. Their attitude may be "The national executive committee do not know him as well as we do; it has not had to work with him and put up with his behaviour as we have. We will not work with him." Who is the person responsible? There is not one, but 30.<br><br>
As I have pointed out to the Committee before, we are dealing with life as it is really lived on this planet—that is, in factories and workshops, not in some

theoretical textbook produced by a Conservative Party study group and by people who have never been on a shop floor. How will the provision work?<br><br>
The employer may say "I want the trade union joined." I do not wish to anticipate our debate on the next set of amendments, but I must make this point; otherwise what I shall say will not be intelligible. The employer asks for the trade union to be joined.<br><br>
Under the terms of the clause, he has only to ask and that will be done. Nobody checks whether there is a <i>prima facie</i> case for saying that the dismissal was a result of pressure by a trade union. Instantly the union has to be joined. So the employer says "I did it only because of pressure from the XYZ union and that union is joined. That wastes everybody's time, because the union will say "We did not prevent the employer from taking on this chap. We are prepared to admit, readmit or retain him in membership." Time has been wasted. The union has been joined in the action merely because the employer asked for it without anyone establishing whether there was sufficient justification.<br><br>
It may then transpire that is was not the fault of the union at all but of the 30 others on the shop floor who refused to work with the thirty-first. Will the hon. and learned Gentleman tell us who is the person responsible? One of them cannot be picked out. They are equals; there is no <i>primus inter pares.</i> It is impossible to identify one or any number fewer than 30. Will they all be joined in the action at the employer's request and on his submission, without any check on the validity of that?<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman said that, even if the union is absolutely guiltless because it has not sought to take any action against the chap in question, it should still be responsible for part of the basic award but not for the compensatory element. He will not make that stick. If one starts from the presumption that a party is totally innocent, no tribunal can make him pay anything.<br><br>
What will be the practical effects of what the hon. and learned Gentleman proposes? The national officer of a trade union will simply say to the district officer "Under no circumstances put any pressure on the employer over Joe Bloggs. Let the matter ride, and the boys themselves will see to it. You will not be called on to do anything about it."<br><br>
That is the bog into which the hon. and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1040</span>
learned Gentleman has fallen. He has given a direct incitement to unofficial action. I am sure that his words will be heeded in every factory, and he may not like the consequences.</span></p>
<p>7 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I sense a feeling in the Committee that our proceedings today should shortly draw to a close. At the same time, I must say that the hon. and learned Gentleman has taken us into some wide interesting territory which deserves a lot more thorough investigation. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) said, to some extent we are anticipating and perhaps trespassing on the subject matter of later amendments.<br><br>
Therefore I assume that we shall have the opportunity to explore some of the issues that have been raised which are relevant to later parts of the Bill. I do not seek to press the hon. and learned Gentleman to reply now, but I give him notice that we shall want to pursue amendment No. 125, for example, in respect of the extent to which the other person or persons who may be joined will be notified about the opportunities that they will have and how they will be identified.<br><br>
Ny hon. Friend spoke of a workshop employing 30 people. He may recall that there were two cases in the 1960s and 1970s that acquired notoriety—those of Mr. Langston and Mr. Goad. What was at issue was a reluctance to be a member of a trade union, with consequent unofficial action that involved not 30 but hundreds of people.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman has plenty of time to think about the matter between now and next Tuesday. How does he envisage that such people will be identified for the purpose of an action? In relation to mass picketing, when the Attorney-General was asked how pickets would be identified, he suggested a bit of camera-work. I do not know whether he feels that that should apply in this instance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A bit of telephone tapping, perhaps.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am only giving the hon. and learned Gentleman notice. Perhaps he will reflect on the matter. I hope that he will tell us—perhaps I misunderstand the Bill—how he reconciles this clause with section 63 of the 1978 Act. It seems to me that one contradicts the other. It is not for

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1041</span>
me to tell him how to make his Bill more effective, but perhaps he will explain the matter in due course. As I have said, I am not pressing the hon. and learned Gentleman for an answer now because the Committee is anxious to reach a conclusion. Perhaps on Tuesday he will answer the points that have been put.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am more concerned at the moment to answer the points made by the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) on this set of amendments than to consider the answers I shall be giving on another set of amendments on Tuesday, if I am spared.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. and learned Gentleman expecting changes in his Department?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no unfair dismissal compensation in this game.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman has been labouring under a misapprehension. I understood him to say that instantly the union has to be joined, as though it were mandatory upon an employer, in the circumstances we are discussing, to join the union in the action. It is not. This clause gives him the power to join the union if he wants to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman misheard me. It is clear that the hon. and learned Gentleman is right in saying that the employer has the right, but does not have to. I said that if the employer does so, the tribunal automatically has to accept what the employer says.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. If that is the case, I apologise. If an application is made to join, that is so. The procedure will require the union to enter an appearance and the matter will then be tried altogether by the tribunal.<br><br>
Let me take the circumstances that the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow puts before us. What he appears to be saying is that here is a union not doing anything officially but giving a nod that is as good as a wink. I gather that that is the only sort of interpretation that we can put on what the hon. Gentleman said. He said, with some relish, that my words would be noted in every union in the land, and so on. I am flattered to think that may be the case.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1042</span>
But the hon. Gentleman is wrong if he supposes that his example will work. He said that the people on the shop floor would say "Never mind what the union is prepared to do. We know how he has behaved, we know about his conduct, the sort of chap he is, and we are not going to work with him." That was how it was put.<br><br>
That comes right outside the ambit of this clause. The clause is concerned only with pressure exercised because the employee was not a member of a trade union, or of any particular trade union. In the hon. Gentleman's example, the employee is being cold-shouldered and shoved out because his colleagues do not like him or the way he has behaved. Therefore, that does not affect the clause.<br><br>
But I do not want to ride it off on a narrow point. I will deal with where a group of people say "You must get rid of this man because he is not a member of the union." It will be for a tribunal to decide where the truth of the matter lies; whether a union is taking part and is behind it, whether a shop steward, branch chairman or someone similar is. Before that, the employer will have to decide whether he wants to join any other person.<br><br>
Speaking for myself, I see no reason why one should conceal one's view of the realities of life on these matters, or be concerned whether one's words will be reported elsewhere. It is not likely that an employer will take two or three of his own work force and join them in this sort of operation. If he was prepared to do that, I doubt whether he would have sacked the man in the first place.<br><br>
But we are really talking about unofficial action on a major scale. This ability to join whoever is really responsible for dismissal and for bringing pressure to bear should not be limited to joining a union but to joining some other person. Whether the employer wants to or not is a matter for his own judgment. It will be for the tribunals with their wide experience of industrial life to decide where the truth of the matter lies.<br><br>
Since the right hon. Gentleman has invited me to spend the weekend cogitating on what I shall say in response to the next group of amendments, I will invite him to pass the long hours of day and night in Doncaster over the weekend in determining his answer to this question. Where an employer has been obliged in practical terms to sack someone who has been a

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1043</span>
blameless worker solely because he is not a member of a trade union, which he does not wish to join, does the right hon. Gentleman believe that if the employer is taken to the cleaners for a substantial sum of compensation for unfair dismissal he ought not to be allowed to ask the tribunal to spread at least some of that liability upon the union that is to blame?</span></p>
