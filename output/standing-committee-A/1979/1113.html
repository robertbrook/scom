There is a doubt whether the payment up of a share, or payment for a share, includes payment of premium.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The main amendment, No. 56, is once again an amendment to the principal clause, in this case to clause 23(1). The other amendments simply serve to bring clauses 6 and 8-which deal with the re-registration as public limited companies of private companies and old public companies-into accord with the proposed drafting of the principal provision from which they are derived.<br><br>
The Committee has already discussed two groups of amendments, relating to clause 22(1) and its dependent provisions and clause 24(1) and its dependent provisions.<br><br>
In both groups of amendments, the motive was to simplify and improve the Bill, and in this case also that is the motive. There is a particularly close connection between the amendment to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0072">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 121</span>
clause 24(1) and the present amendment to clause 23(1).<br><br>
As in that case, we think it better to rely on the well understood and long-established concept of shares being in whole, or in part, paid up as to their nominal value and any premium by a consideration. I shall not go over the arguments which were advanced in detail on clause 24(1), for they apply equally here.<br><br>
Equally, in clause 24(1), it was explained why we wished to move away from the specific reference to a "non-cash asset" to the broader formulation of "a consideration other than cash ". Again the same arguments apply here. Therefore, in place of the present formulation in clause 23(1), amendment No. 56 proposes that
<br><blockquote><p>"A public company shall not allot shares as fully or partly paid up (as to their nominal value or any premium payable on them) otherwise than in cash if the consideration for the allotment is or includes an undertaking which is to be or may be performed more than five years after the date of the allotment."</p></blockquote>
As I said earlier, the other amendments, to clauses 6 and 8, merely bring the provisions of those clauses into line with the reformulation proposed for clause 23(1).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend used the phrase, which he used also in amendment No. 56,
<br><blockquote><p>"more than five years after the date of the allotment".</p></blockquote>
Can he tell me what the date of allotment is in the case of the original subscribers? I understand that in an old case in 1902, Lurgan's case, it was decided that there need be no allotment in the case of original subscribers. There is, therefore, a little doubt as to the commencement of the period of five years which is so important under this and later clauses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has raised a somewhat technical matter. I understand that the date of registration in the circumstances to which he has just referred is the date of registration of the memorandum. I hope that my right hon. Friend will find that information helpful.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i>That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask for a little more information about clause 6. It deals with private companies reregistering as public companies. I shall give a fanciful example to explain my difficulty.<br><br>
Let us assume that a private company has been formed to take over the unincorporated firm of Steptoe and Son. The wheels are coming off the Steptoe cart and the legs are coming off the horse. So Steptoe father gives an undertaking that he will buy a new cart for the new company, and Steptoe son gives an undertaking that he will buy a new horse for the company. Then they hear of this Companies Bill, and decide to go public—that is, re-register as a public company. But they cannot do so unless their undertakings were performed within five years of the allotment. That, I gather, would be the registration of the memorandum of association. They were subscribers, so one dates it from that date. Even if they beat the Act, and go public before this Bill is enacted, they are faced with the same problem.<br><br>
My example, of course, is only fanciful, but it might apply to much larger undertakings which have to meet with this difficulty that their undertakings for acquisition of assets must be performed within five years of the date of allotment of the shares in return for that undertaking.<br><br>
I cannot see why it is necessary to have this period of time. It may be a substantial asset being purchased by instalments or being purchased gradually for the purpose of the company. In my view, a five-year period is very rigid and gives no flexibility in the conversion of private companies into public companies. A decision must have been taken somewhere as to why it should be five years and why this period was inserted in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0073">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 123</span>
Bill. It would be valuable to have that information on record.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In reply to my right hon. Friend, I must emphasise that the basis of this provision is that the directive calls for equivalent safeguards. Applying that reasoning to the illustrative case developed by my right hon. Friend, he must agree that if the new cart or the new horse were not supplied within five years they would not have a business at all to transfer to a public company. So I hope that my right hon. Friend will accept that this is a proper and reasonable provision within the requirements of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask just one more question? I assume that the period of five years runs from the date of allotment, but that is not quite clear all the way through this clause and the later clauses which repeat it. In some cases it seems that it will be five years from the undertaking being given—it must be a five-year undertaking and completed within those five years. So if it were an undertaking given before the formation of the company—as an agreement, so to speak, to form a private company into a public company or a firm into an incorporated company—does the five years run from the time that the undertaking was given or from the actual formation of the company?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The strict answer to my right hon. Friend is that the period of five years runs from the special resolution to go public. In the circumstances that he has described, when an undertaking is given at an earlier date, I imagine that it would be possible for that undertaking to be renewed at the date that I mentioned, and therefore for the benefit of the five-year period to be made fully available.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 29, in clause 10, page 14, line 28, leave out subsection (8).</p>
<p>No. 36, in clause 12, page 16, line 43, leave out subsection (4).</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To say that these are technical amendments is rather superfluous, since it is a highly technical Bill and every amendment is a technical one.<br><br>
The effect of the first amendment is that after the end of the transitional period the references in part I of the Bill to "public company" will not include references to an old public company. As a consequence, two provisions in particular of part I, namely, clauses 10(8) and 12(4), which in those specific cases exclude old public companies from the references to public companies, may be removed, as their purpose is achieved by the first amendment.<br><br>
By the first amendment we make quite clear that old public companies are not included in the reference to public companies, and therefore there is no need to say so specifically in the two clauses that I have mentioned. In addition, there are other references in part I to public companies which after the end of the transitional period would, as clause 8 stands at present, seem to cover old public companies as well and which should not do so.<br><br>
The first amendment under discussion puts an end to that confusion by excluding from part I the presumption that, after the end of the transitional period, the term "public company" excludes old public companies. It may interest the Committee to know that by inserting those four words we remove two subsections from the Bill. I imagine that the Committee would like to congratulate my officials on their continuing search for brevity.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Stephen. We could discuss the next two amendments at the same time, provided that that is not inconvenient to my hon. Friends on the Front Bench. The amendments are all on much the same point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy for the Committee to discuss together as many amendments as possible.</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>Therefore, we may also take No. 171, in page 11, line 7, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>"not less than two directors"</p></blockquote></p>
<p>and insert "a director or the Secretary" and No. 172, in page 11, line 33, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>"not less than two directors"</p></blockquote>
and insert "a director or the Secretary".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have discussed this principle earlier in our debates. All the amendments are an effort to simplify the procedure for the registration of a company. In the first case it seems unnecessary, when there is a special resolution which can be printed—or even typed, I should have thought, or photocopied or reproduced in any other way—that tells the full story of the re-registration, to print the whole of the memorandum again. Perhaps that is not necessary, and I am reading too much into the words "printed" or "printed copy".<br><br>
However, I hope that removing the word "printed" will make it sufficient for the existing memorandum, plus a slip showing the special resolution, to be accepted by the registrar of companies. That is what happens when one alters the memorandum and articles in other cases. It is done by a slip and, when convenient, one can consolidate the whole memorandum and articles—if if there are many alterations—into a new print. It should not be reprinted for one special resolution.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
There is a further point concerning who should make the statutory declaration. Under some parts of the 1948 Act and under some parts of this Bill, it is quite sufficient for one director or the secretary to make the statutory declaration. Subsection (3) states that the application may be signed by "a director or secretary," but under subsection (5)
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 126</span>
the statutory declaration has to be made
<br><blockquote><p>"by not less than two directors of the company".</p></blockquote>
I think that one is sufficient, and I hope that we can adopt the practice throughout company law in future that applications in writing and even statutory declarations can be made by one director or the secretary.<br><br>
There is no great risk of one director defrauding a company by signing a statutory declaration because there is no other director to sign the document with him. The trouble involved in getting two to make a statutory declaration is not worth it. I hope that it will be accepted that we can rely on one director or the secretary making the statutory declarations—those included in clauses 8 and 10.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin Stevens</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be willing to support my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), subject to one comment. Most of us know that company secretaries are usually better informed on these highly technical matters than are company directors, although quite often the company secretary is also a director. However, I think that it would be generally unacceptable to boards to have statutory declarations made only by the company secretary who, in other cases, may not be a particularly senior person. I should have thought that, rather than specify two directors, one might specify one director and the company secretary, and not, as my right hon. Friend proposes
<br><blockquote><p>"a director or the Secretary".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I refer to amendments Nos. 170 and 174 first. The affect of these amendments is to remove the requirements in clauses 8 and 10 that the amended copy of the memorandum and articles delivered to the registrar should be printed. It is essentially a practical matter, which we touched upon at the end of the last sitting. I then made reference to the notes for guidance issued by the registrar of companies, in response to the arguments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page). He said that if one is altering the memorandum and articles in a normal way, it can be done by means of a printed slip, stating the resolution, attached to the existing copy. My right hon. Friend referred to that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0075">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 127</span>
aspect again this morning. He argued that, having regard to the present cost of printing, we ought not to throw any greater burden on a company changing from public to private. I entirely agree with that, both in the context of clause 5, which we discussed at the previous sitting, and of clauses 8 and 10 to which my right hon. Friend referred today.<br><br>
The Companies Acts require various documents to be printed, including articles of association—where the obligation dates from 1862—and amended articles and memorandum. In the notes for guidance of registered companies, it is stated that the registrar is prepared to regard the printing stipulations as satisfied by the following processes:
<br><blockquote><p>"Letterpress, gravure, lithography, stencil duplicative using waxed stencils and black ink. Offset lithography, 'office' type set, electrostatic photocopying, 'photostat' or similar processes properly processed and washed."</p></blockquote>
That offers a very wide range, but if one goes further one finds even more helpful advice on minor changes in memoranda and articles. I quote:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Registrar's present practice is to accept copies of the memorandum and articles amended in accordance with the following rules."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is fascinating stuff, but it is all available in the report of the Standing Committee on the 1976 Companies Bill. It would be helpful if this information could be abbreviated. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman does not require all this detail.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is entitled to his opinion, but, the matter having been raised in this Committee, it is necessary that I give a proper reply—not only for members of this Committee who may have served on a previous Committee but also for those outside who are interested in these proceedings. They may not have the knowledge of previous proceedings which is vested in the hon. Gentleman. I feel that I am under an obligation to give this information because it may be helpful to people concerned about this problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the hon. Gentleman is really overstating the view that the public outside will investigate in detail what is said in this Com-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 128</span>
mittee. This is a matter which the registrar can clear up, should there be any doubt. I am anxious to get on with the Bill so that we can come to the important discussions we shall be having in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's concern about making progress, and I share his desire. However, on this point which my right hon. Friend has raised, supported by my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Stevens), I maintain that I am under the obligation to give a proper reply. I assure the hon. Gentleman that I shall do that as briefly as possible.<br><br>
The guidance notes continue:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where the amendment is small in extent,—"</p></blockquote>
this includes the slip which I think my right hon. Friend had in mind—
<br><blockquote><p>"e.g. a change of name or a change in the nominal capital, a copy of the original document may be amended by rubber stamp, ' top copy' typing or in some other permanent manner (but not a manuscript amendment). An alteration of a few lines or a complete short paragraph may be similarly dealt with if the new version is satisfactorily permanently affixed to a copy of the original in such a way as to obscure the words to be amended. Where more substantial amendments are involved, the pages amended may be removed from a copy of the original, the amended text inserted and the pages securely collated. The inserted material must be 'printed' as defined above but need not be produced by the same process as the original.

I said at the beginning that we were facing a practical issue. It seems to me to he one which has, in present practice, a sensible practical answer to the point which my right hon. Friend raised. On this basis, I hope that he will feel that it is not necessary to press his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stevens</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State answers that point with great clarity. I am grateful that he did so because, although the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) said that the information was available to all of us, it certainly had not previously been available to me. Would it not be of assistance to the many thousands of people who will have to operate this Bill, and who may not be professional people in every case, if we incorporated at some place in the Bill when published a list of definitions—one

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate my hon. Friend's suggestion. As the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) said, it is for the registrar to give this helpful information. I shall ask that the point that my hon. Friend made is borne in mind by the registrar.<br><br>
I refer now to amendments Nos. 171 and 172. These amendments are concerned with the statutory declaration that has to be made under clause 8 for the re-registration of an old public company as a public company. The amendments propose that the necessary statutory declaration in the prescribed form stating whether the relevant conditions have been met should be made by
<br><blockquote><p>"a director or the Secretary"</p></blockquote>
rather than
<br><blockquote><p>"not less than two directors"</p></blockquote>
of the company.<br><br>
At our last sitting my right hon. Friend raised this question again in relation to private companies re-registering as public companies under clause 5. As I said then, I think that this point is a good one and we are therefore prepared to support the amendments. I am sure that that will please my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Stevens), who also supported this proposal. My right hon. Friend has taken away from us some of the chore of amending the Bill to meet his point.

FAILURE BY OLD PUBLIC COMPANY TO OBTAIN NEW CLASSIFICATION</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 25, in page 12, line 40, after "refused", insert "or withdrawn".<br><br>
The effect of the amendment is to reduce the scope of the defence in subsection 1(<i>a</i>) so that an old public company and any officer in default will be guilty of an offence under the subsection if, having applied for re-registration as a public company under clause 8, it has at that time withdrawn the application.<br><br>
Clause 9 is aimed at ensuring that old public companies take the necessary steps to determine their status under the new classification. Clause 8 provides a flexible system for doing this, but it is obviously important from the point of view of shareholders and creditors that companies should not remain in no-man's-land. Clause 9 therefore imposes criminal sanctions on companies which remain old public companies at the end of the re-registration period, unless they are in the process of becoming public or

private under the new classification. Paragraph (<i>a</i>)provides a defence when they are becoming public and paragraph (<i>b</i>)when they are becoming private.<br><br>
Paragraph (<i>a</i>), however, is considered to be too generous. It aims to identify companies which are in the process of seeking to become public and so excludes companies which, although they have applied, have had their application refused by the registrar. It ought also to exclude cases where a company applies but, before the matter is decided, withdraws the application. This is what the amendment achieves. It also brings paragraph (<i>a</i>)into line with paragraph (<i>b</i>), which contemplates the revocation of the special resolution, which is the equivalent of the withdrawal of the application under paragraph (<i>a</i>).</span></p>

<p>11.00 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 175, in page 14, line 1, leave out subsection (4).<br><br>
Clause 10 deals with the re-registration of public companies as private companies. Subsection 4 provides:
<br><blockquote><p>"If the company fails to make an application for re-registration under this section within the relevant period the company and any officer of the company who is in default shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding one-fifth of the statutory maximum or, on conviction after continued contravention, a default fine not exceeding one-fiftieth of the statutory maximum for each day until the application is made."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps I seemed tedious in reading that out, but it seems rather a Draconian measure for an idle director, if I may so put it.<br><br>
Does it really do any harm to the public
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 132</span>
if a public company remains silent, in limbo, moribund or whatever it may be—provided, of course, that it is not carrying on business under some name which it ought not to have? Does it really matter to the public if there is a delay in re-registration? Is this not an instance where the Secretary of State should be empowered to strike out the company, to put it into liquidation, or take out a petition against it, rather than make criminals of the directors, idle and at fault though they may have been? I cannot for the life of me see why we have to put subsection 4 into a clause of this kind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) has made a powerful point. The effect of the amendment is to remove the criminal sanctions from public companies and their directors when they do not forward to the registrar the application for a public company to be re-registered as private within the relevant period specified within subsection 3.<br><br>
We are concerned here with voluntary changes undertaken by public limited companies—what one might describe as new public companies. It is important to bear that in mind. It does not involve changes required by the directive because the company does not have sufficient share capital or because it is an old public company and should make up its mind which status it wishes to acquire.<br><br>
We have looked again at the need for criminal sanctions in the present case where the directors do not carry out the wishes of the shareholders who have agreed to change by special resolution. I hasten to make clear that we have looked at this solely because of the perspicacity of my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby, and what we have found is not very sensible.<br><br>
To the extent that the Bill proposes criminal sanctions when the directors do not do what the shareholders have agreed to, we go too far. Naturally, the change from public to private is important, but that does not justify criminal sanctions. There could be civil remedies available where the directors have flouted the wishes of the company, and, indeed, the much more powerful sanction of an ordinary resolution to remove the directors. Furthermore, there are no criminal sanctions when directors do not carry out the conversion of a private company to a public company under clause 5, even
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0078">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 133</span>
though the same degree of shareholder approval is required. Similarly, there are no criminal sanctions in the 1967 Act where unlimited companies wish to be reregistered as limited, and vice versa.<br><br>
But there is a convincing argument of public policy for sanctions in certain more limited circumstances. I agree that such sanctions are unnecessary when the company does not do what it is authorised to do. However, such sanctions are appropriate to ensure that, where the appropriate resolution for re-registration has been passed under the clause, the company does not seek re-registration before the time allowed for minority shareholders to apply to the court for relief.<br><br>
The possibility of such relief is an important safeguard for the shareholders, who could be prejudiced by a change from public to private status. For this protection to have any value, people must have the 28 days envisaged in clause 11 (4) in which to apply to the court for relief. Equally, once the company knows that the court is seized of the matter, it should not apply for re-registration until the court has confirmed the resolution or until the application is withdrawn. I hope that my right hon. Friend will agree that criminal sanctions are appropriate in such cases to protect the rights provided to minority shareholders.<br><br>
The upshot of all this is that subsections (3) and (4) will need to be redrafted. The Government will bring forward appropriate amendments on Report. In the light of my assurance, I wonder whether my right hon. Friend will be prepared to withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that explanation of the position, which was far better than the explanation I gave when I moved the amendment, and for saying that the two subsections will be redrafted.

<p><i>Question proposed,</i>That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (5) deals with the application for cancellation made under subsection (2). It places on the company the duty
<br><blockquote><p>"give notice in the prescribed form"</p></blockquote>
to the registrar that the application has been made. Surely the right person to give the notice is the applicant himself. He is the man who is taking the initiative. It seems rather unfortunate that it should be the company which has the duty to register with the registrar of companies something which has been initiated by the shareholder who is taking action against that company.<br><br>
It follows from that—we touched on this matter on the last amendment debated—that, if the company does not give notice, the company and its officers become criminals. I can see that there should be some assurance that the registrar is notified, but I would have thought that the duty should fall on the applicant. I am surprised that this burden should be put on the company.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend raises a very technical point. I think it may help him if I tell him that the rules of the court provide for notice to the company, which would be given by the applicant, and therefore that aspect is not provided for in the Bill.<br><br>
That does not fully answer my right hon. Friend's question as to why there should be an obligation upon the company. I take my right hon. Friend's point, and we wish to ease burdens. Nevertheless, in view of the involved nature of the pro-

SHARES AND DEBENTURES OF PRIVATE COMPANY NOT TO BE OFFERED TO PUBLIC</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 114, in page 20, line 20, leave out "limited".<br><br>
The word "limited" appears in the first phrase of clause 15, which applies clause 15 to "a private limited company". I do not think that anywhere else in the Bill is the word "1limited" used in talking about a private company. Why is it inserted here? Does it hold any significance? Cannot we be consistent throughout the Bill in referring to public companies or private companies, or indeed, old public companies, to which phrase I suppose we shall become used, in due course? But why is "private limited company" used in this case? This is merely a probing amendment and I should like the Minister's explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The effect of my right hon. Friend's amendment would be to apply the provisions of clause 15 to all private companies other than companies limited by guarantee and not having share capital, instead of only to private limited companies with the same exception. This is not a simple issue and I am glad that my
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 136</span>
right hon. Friend has raised the question. I am glad, too, to hear that his amendment is moved on a probing basis.<br><br>
The question was also raised by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators in comments which the institute submitted to my Department. The exclusion of unlimited companies from these provisions was, in fact, no accident. It was a deliberate choice for reasons which I should like to set out.<br><br>
Unlimited companies, whether or not they have a share capital, are excluded from the scope of the second directive. Such companies will, by virtue of clause 1, be private companies and will not be able to become public companies. This is not in dispute, and, so far as I know, no one wishes it to be disputed. The Committee has, indeed, already approved the relevant clause, which is clause 1. We have the position, therefore, that if we applied clause 15 to all private companies other than those limited by guarantee without a share capital, unlimited companies would be prohibited from offering shares for debentures to the public.<br><br>
Such a prohibition is, as I have said—and this is an important point—not required by the directive, and we therefore have to ask whether we none the less wish to make such a prohibition. The idea of shares in unlimited companies being offered to the public is in some respects an odd one, as the shares carry with them, of course, limited liability for the company's debts. However, we consider that it would be unduly onerous to prevent companies from making such offers even though the case for such an offer may appear somewhat unusual. The case of an unlimited company wanting to offer debentures to the public may be more readily imagined.<br><br>
The answer proposed by the Bill in this respect is one in which it follows the previous Bill, and it is a pragmatic answer. It does not seek to box a limited company's ears but allows the matter to be decided by the company's own constitution. I do not think that anyone is objecting to this proposal. It seems to be a reasonable and sensible answer in all the circumstances, and I hope that in the light of my explanation of the deliberate policy undertaken in the provision, my right hon. Friend will not press his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to my hon. Friend for that explanation, which was not clear from the text of the

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 137</span>
Bill itself. It is as well to have it on record so that at least those who do read our Committee proceedings will understand why the word "limited" is inserted. My hon. Friend explained perfectly well why the word is in the Bill in clause 15, and I accept it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i>That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the clause which prevents private companies offering shares and debentures for sale to the public. I am sure that members of the Committee will have received representations from many outside bodies. The clause, especially subsection (1), is too restrictive. If it is taken literally, it will prevent private companies obtaining the finance they need. In the course of raising that finance they can do no harm to their other shareholders or to the public.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
Government amendments which may solve this problem have appeared on the Order Paper over the weekend. 1 do not wish to let clause 15 go by without raising the matter. However, if I am assured that my point will be fully dealt with when we come to those amendments, it would be silly to debate the point twice. May I briefly say what I hope that those amendments will eventually do but clause 15 does not do at the moment. It does not make it clear that a private company can offer shares and debentures, first, to all existing members or debenture holders, and second, to anyone to whom they renounce their entitlement to those shares, provided that the renouncee is within the terms of those who can take transfers of shares under the memorandum and articles of the company.<br><br>
I do not think that the later amendments entirely cover that point. I know that clause 15 does not. Clause 15 must be extended beyond its present rather tight provision. Otherwise, we shall be harming the private company that quite reasonably wishes to raise capital. Could my hon. Friend deal with that point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Archer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise only to set down a marker. We, too, had it in mind to raise the matter. I do not wish to take up the time of the Committee. Like the right
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 138</span>
hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), I should be content to leave the matter if it is to be dealt with later. We are somewhat concerned that the effect of the existing drafting is that criminal sanctions appear to attach to an offence which is somewhat loosely defined. I rise simply to say that we, too, should wish to pursue the point now if it is not to be pursued later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) for having raised this important question at this stage. I am grateful also to the Law Society of England and Wales and the Law Society of Scotland, which raised similar points in the course of consultation and comment on the Bill. I also appreciate the intervention of the right hon. and learned Member for Warley, West (Mr. Archer). I believe that my reply will satisfy him on the matter.<br><br>
The Government fully accept that the Bill needs improvement in this area. We have therefore put down an amendment to schedule 3. The matter is complex, and I am anxious not to take too much of the Committee's time on a detailed examination of it at this stage. On the other hand, it is right that I should outline to the Committee the effect of that proposed amendment, which would have a significant impact on this important clause. I also assure the Committee that if, after discussion on the,proposed amendment to schedule 3, it then appears that an amendment to this clause is required, we shall be willing to look at that in time for Report.<br><br>
Clause 15 prohibits a private company from offering shares or debentures to the public. The definition of an offer to the public for the purposes of the Companies Act 1948 is in section 55 of that Act. The Government are convinced that we should have the same definition for the present purpose.<br><br>
Clause, 56 (3) of the Bill achieves that intention, which is not at issue here. It has, however, been pointed out to us that, now that the shareholding in private companies may, with the repeal of section 28 of the 1948 Act, be much more widely spread, and now that it will be a criminal offence for a private company to make an offer to the public, it is desirable to relax the provisions of section 55 so that it does not unreasonably restrict the power of private companies to raise money by the issue of securities in an entirely legitimate way.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0081">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 139</span>
Paragraph 11 of schedule 3 seeks to do this by providing a presumption that where a private company offers shares or debentures to the existing members or debenture holders or offers shares to be held under an employees' share scheme, this is to be presumed to be an offer which is not calculated to result as mentioned in section 55(2). In other words, it is not calculated to result directly or indirectly in the shares or debentures becoming available for subscription or purchase by persons other than those receiving the offer.<br><br>
The effect of this is that although section 55(1) requires offers to a section of the public to be treated as offers to the public as a result of section 55(2), an offer of this kind will be presumed not to be required by section 55(1) to be treated as an offer to the public.<br><br>
I should emphasise that the Bill merely creates a presumption in favour of an offer of this kind. The Government do not believe that it would be right to provide a blanket exemption for all offers by private companies to existing members or debenture holders or for employee share schemes. This would mean that even if there was a full indication that the offer was calculated to result in the general public having access to the shares, no offence would have been committed and the protections in the 1948 Act as to the prospectuses and so on would not apply.<br><br>
While it has been suggested that a blanket exemption of this kind is what is needed, we are not convinced of that. On the other hand, the effect of the existing paragraph may well be that if the company offers securities to members, debenture holders or employees on terms that the offer may be renounced in favour of other members, debenture holders or employees or some permutation of all these, this in itself would be evidence which rebutted the presumption that the offer is only calculated to result in the securities becoming available for subscription or purchase by the persons to whom the offer is addressed. Renounceable offers, in fact, would not have the benefit of the presumption.<br><br>
We agree that there is at least a doubt about this. We also believe that paragraph 11 is drafted too narrowly in two other respects. It should extend to the families of members as well as to the members themselves. As the paragraph stands the reference to
<br><blockquote><p>"the existing members or debenture holders"</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 140</span>
may imply that an offer to some and not all of such persons would not qualify. My right hon. Friend's Amendment No. 112 deals with this last point. Therefore, we have brought forward an amendment to schedule 3 which would provide a presumption that an offer to any members or their families, to employees or their families, to debenture holders or to any of those persons on terms that the offer is renounceable in favour of any of them is a matter of domestic concern to the company and, therefore, not an offer to the public.<br><br>
I repeat my earlier assurance that when the amendments to schedule 3 have been considered by the Committee, if any consequential amendments are called for to clause 15 we shall, of course, bring forward the necessary amendments on Report or support other right hon. and hon. Members in so doing. On the basis of what I believe to be a very strong assurance, I hope that my right hon. Friend will agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.</span></p>

PRE-EMPTION RIGHTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 120, in page 21, line 38, after "a", insert "public".<br><br>
The amendment looks fairly simple—merely inserting the word "public" after "a" in the first line—but, of course, this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0082">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 141</span>
affects the whole principle of the clause. Clause 17 deals with pre-emption rights and it is a very complicated clause—and complicated in order to protect the public. My amendment seeks to apply the clause to a public company only and not to put a private company to all the complications and difficulties of the clause.<br><br>
It is clear that clause 17 is for the protection not only of the shareholders and debenture holders of the company but also of the public, and it seems to relate far more to public companies than to private companies.<br><br>
As I read the directive, we are not obliged to apply the pre-emption rights restrictions to private companies, and it would be permissible under the directive to restrict the clause to public companies. Without going through the clause in detail, I foresee considerable difficulties for a private company to keep within the provisions of the clause. I therefore propose that the clause be applied only to public companies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The effect of the amendment moved by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) is to restrict clause 17, which establishes certain pre-emptive rights for existing shareholders in public and private companies, to shareholders in public companies only. Before turning to the substance of my right hon. Friend's case, it may assist the Committee if I sketch briefly the immediate background to this proposal.<br><br>
The starting point is the second directive. That requires pre-emptive rights for shareholders in public companies. It does not apply to private companies. However, in the consultative and explanatory note published by the Department of Trade on the implementation of the second directive, it was proposed to apply the pre-emption provisions to private as well as to public companies. When the Bill was eventually published, representations were received from a number of bodies, many of which raised issues on what are now clauses 17 to 19. They included the Law Society of England and Wales, the Law Society of Scotland, the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, the Association of British Chambers of Commerce and the London Chamber of Commerce and industry.<br><br>
Of all those that commented, only the Law Society of England and Wales argued
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 142</span>
that what is now clause 17 should not apply to private companies. On the previous Bill, I understand that the view of the Law Society was somewhat tentatively expressed, but in its latest comments on the present Bill it appears to be much firmer. I emphasise to the Committee the importance that the Department attaches to careful consideration of all the detailed representations made by those learned bodies in considering complicated legislative matters of this kind. We appreciate the assistance that we receive from them.<br><br>
I turn to the substance of the provision. Should clause 17 apply to private companies in the way that is proposed in the Bill, or should they be excluded?<br><br>
For exclusion, there is the argument that rights of pre-emption are a matter for agreement between the shareholders and should not be laid down by statute. There is a further argument that to apply these provisions to private companies would be to add to the complexities which private companies face. Those are serious, weighty arguments and we have considered them with care. Hon. Members will be in no doubt as to the determination of the Government to free small companies from the burden of new and existing legislation where no good case can be made out for a provision and where we cannot demonstrate that the clear advantages strongly outweigh the disadvantages. We recognise that the burden of proof is upon us in this case to justify the proposal.<br><br>
I now look at the effect of clauses 17 to 19 upon private companies. Clause 17 establishes the basic right of pre-emption. Clause 18 then permits companies, by special resolution of the shareholders in general meeting, to restrict or withdraw those rights for periods of up to five years.<br><br>
Clause 19 deals with transitional measures and saves certain existing arrangements which are inconsistent with those proposed by clause 17—in other words, protection for vested rights.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
These rules apply to public and private companies in almost exactly the same way. The differences are minor. If the matter rested on that basis, there would be considerable force in the objections raised to applying these clauses to private companies.<br><br>
However, there is a further and most important provision which applies exclusively to private companies. It is to be found in clause 17(7), and its essence is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0083">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 143</span>
contained in the first half of the sub-section:
<br><blockquote><p>"Subsection (1), (4) or (5) above may, in its application in relation to allotments by a private company of equity securities or to such allotments of a particular description, be excluded by a provision contained in the memorandum or articles of that company."</p></blockquote>
I repeat the important words:
<br><blockquote><p>"be excluded by a provision contained in the memorandum or articles of that company".</p></blockquote>
To put it simply, private companies can, by a special resolution altering their articles, exclude completely the operation of clause 17 and remove any right of pre-emption. There is no time limit—as in the case of public companies—confining the exclusion to a five-year maximum period. A provision in a private company's articles can run for ever. Therefore, in the case of private companies, we have established a presumption in favour of rights of pre-emption. But we have provided an easy avenue for the share- holders to give up their rights. I suggest that that is not a particularly heavy burden.<br><br>
What, on the other side of the scale, are the advantages? Those who have experience of private companies know only too well that problems and disputes do arise within small companies and shareholders do fall out. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) and the right hon. and learned Member for Warley, West (Mr. Archer) have experience of the way in which people can fall out in companies. It is a fact of life.<br><br>
People should look after their own interests and should not expect the Government to take over this role. They should be free to arrange their affairs as they wish and as they agree between themselves. But what happens if there is no agreement at all, if the constitution of the company neither excludes nor includes any reference to rights of pre-emption? Should minority shareholders have no right to maintain their proportionate stake in the company when further shares are issued for cash? Is it not reasonable to say that in the absence of contrary arrange- ments, shareholders should have such rights?<br><br>
The Government's view is that there is a clear balance of advantage in providing such a presumption in favour of pre-emption to deal with this specific problem. Of course, clause 47 of the Bill contains a general provision intended to permit the court to protect shareholders' interests
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 144</span>
which are being unfairly prejudiced. But that must operate less effectively in the clearly defined set of circumstances that we are presently considering than in the specific measure of protection which we have in mind under that clause.<br><br>
We must not burden small companies with needless legislative requirements but, in resisting undesirable measures, we must not lose sight of the complex and sometimes diverse interests which exist in private companies. In this instance—I say this with great respect for all the work that it does—the Law Society of England and Wales has got the balance wrong. To some extent, I take comfort in the fact that it alone has raised the matter.<br><br>
In my view, the Bill forms a valuable measure of protection to shareholders in small companies—a fair starting point from which they are perfectly free to make other arrangements in the ways that I have described. I hope that, in the light of my explanation, my right hon. Friend will not press the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to my hon. Friend for that explanation, and particularly for calling attention to subsection (7) of clause 17, which gives a private company the power to make provision in its memorandum or articles for excluding the application of clause 17 itself. Only subsections (1), (4) and (5) are specified but, generally speaking, the missing subsections apply to subsection (1) and so are wiped out. Subsections (2) and (3) apply to subsection (1), so there is no real gap.<br><br>
Of course, one must pay attention to points put forward by the Law Societies. The Law Societies put this point forward twice. After thinking about the matter after the first Bill, they came forward on the present Bill with a forceful argument that private companies should be entirely excluded from these clauses. But I must agree with my hon. Friend that it was naive of the learned societies to say that the shareholders of private companies ought to be able to reach agreement between themselves about the pre-emption rights and how they should be exercised. Very often, shareholders squabble far more in private companies than in public companies. I do not think that that argument was strong enough.<br><br>
I think that the possibility of the exclusion of private companies might have been spelt out more clearly in clause 17,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0084">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 145</span>
but nevertheless I am satisfied with my hon. Friend's point that the subsections may be excluded in the memorandum and articles. On that basis, I beg to_ ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The principal amendment in this group is amendment No. 41. The other amendments are simply drafting ame
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 146</span>
ments consequential on amendment No. 41.<br><br>
the purpose of amendment no. 41 is to replace subsection (2) of clause 17 with a provision which more clearly establishes the right of a shareholder who has received a pre-emptive offer of shares under the subsection to renounce validly his rights to the shares on offer in favour of another person.<br><br>
Clause 17 is concerned, in broad nontechnical terms, with the rights of existing shareholders to have a right of first refusal to shares which the company proposes to issue for cash. The normal rule set out in subsection (1) is that all holders of relevant shares have such a right in proportion to the shareholding in the total equity capital. However, subsection (2) takes advantage of a derogation in the directive which permits special treatment for cases where a company has more than one class of relevant, shares, and proposes to issue for cash securities of one of those classes.<br><br>
The policy underlying the directive, the present draft and the amendment is that in such cases the company may, instead of making the pre-emptive offer to all holders of relevant shares, as subsection (1) would require, make a first pre-emptive offer to the holders of relevant shares of that class, and only afterwards in the manner called for by subsection (1). The effect of this is to maintain a degree of priority for shareholders of that particular class, if that is provided for in the memorandum or articles.<br><br>
Where the two drafts differ is in whether a holder of relevant shares of the particular class may, when he receives the first preemptive offer, sell those rights to some other person. It is clearly desirable that he should be able to do so. It mirrors present practice, and, of course, not to do that would simply penalise those who could not afford to take up their rights. They would lose the value of the rights and be worse off as the result of a provision aimed at shareholders' protection, which would be a curious result, to say the least.<br><br>
It might be argued that the Bill as drafted permits such renunciations in favour of third parties, because those third parties would accept, and thus t he shares on offer would not have to be offered under subsection (1) to shareholders generally. However, I am advised that there is real doubt about whether the Bill as drafted achieves that. Such doubt is undesirable, and therefore Amendment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0085">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 147</span>
No. 41 seeks to put the matter beyond doubt. Hon. Members will see that, as a matter of drafting, what was subsection (2) has now been split into two subsections. I believe that that helps in understanding a complex provision.<br><br>
The other amendments that we are considering are all purely drafting changes that follow from the redrafting of subsection (2). I hope that right hon. and hon. Members will accept these worthwhile amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I tried to follow my hon. Friend's argument but was not sufficiently clever to do so. I have not entirely grasped the purpose of the amendments. It may be that they have covered an amendment of mine that I hoped you would call next, Sir Stephen. If so, I may be relieved of the need to propose it.<br><br>
I doubted whether the clause made any provision for issues of rights to different classes of shareholder—whether such an issue could be made to one class and not to another, or whether the issue could be made on different terms as regards the different classes. The use of the phrase "relevant class" in clause 17(1)(<i>a</i>) seems to me to make no provision for different rights being offered to different classes.<br><br>
I understood my hon. Friend to say he considers that the clause already provides for that, by using the term "relevant shares". If that is so, we move on to what my hon. Friend is trying to do in Amendment No. 41, which I understand is intended to provide for what happens when some of the rights are not taken up. Do they revert to the company, for the company to spread them among the shareholders, or can they be sold by the shareholders to whom they have been offered?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if my right hon. Friend would consider this point. The amendments do not include Amendment No. 121, which deals with the point about the word "class". I believe that that is what my right hon. Friend has in mind. If he were able to accept our amendments, I think he would find that we can discuss in detail the problems that concern him when we come to the next amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to my hon. friend. In that case, I shall restrict my remarks to what I understand my hon. Friend to say with reference to Amend-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 148</span>
ment No. 41. I am not quite clear, either from the wording of the amendment or from what he said, whether the company will eventually be entitled to distribute the rights that are not taken up among other shareholders, whether those rights can be sold by the original shareholder to whom they were offered, or exactly what happens to them.<br><br>
I may have been particularly stupid in failing to understand what my hon. Friend said, but the whole purpose of his amendment is not clear to me. I do not wish to lengthen the Committee's proceedings, but could he summarise his answers to those two questions, or perhaps one of them, namely, what happens to the rights which a shareholder does not want or cannot take up?</span></p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are in some difficulty in considering the amendments to clause 17. Because of the way they have been grouped, there is bound to be a certain degree of overlapping.<br><br>
In my remarks on the amendments, particularly Amendment No. 4], I described in detail the situation applying specifically with regard to certain rather limited circumstances. The point raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) has some relevance to other amendments. If he will be prepared to take this by stages, I am sure that all will become clear to him. It would certainly help me and perhaps other. Members of the Committee if we could take the subject by stages.<br><br>
Naturally, I shall be glad to listen to, and try hard to take account of, any points that my right hon. Friend has outstanding at the end of the process. I hope that he will bear with me on these amendments, which fit into a larger pattern which will gradually reveal itself as we, move through the debate. I shall give close attention, in particular, to the amendments tabled by my right hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to adjust to this discussion the title of a song which, I believe, is nearly top of the pops—"One Day at a Time"—and say "one amendment at a time". I am obliged to my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 121, in page 21, line 42,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0086">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 149</span>
after first "shares", insert "of the same class".<br><br>
On a previous amendment, I had the opportunity of explaining the purpose of Amendment No. 121, which is to make certain that it is possible for the company to offer different rights for different classes of shares. In the drafting of the clause there is the power to offer different rights to the ordinary shareholder as compared with the employee, and, indeed, if that were not so, many of the very important schemes that have from time to time been offered by companies for employees would not be possible under the clause. It is clear that that must be so. Employees could be offered rights different from those offered to shareholders.<br><br>
I am not sure whether the ordinary and preferred shareholder could be offered different rights under the clause as it stands, or even, if there were ordinary shares of class A and class B having different rights under the articles, whether one could offer them different rights under clause 17. In order, I would hope, to make it clear, I have inserted after "relevant shares" the words "of the same class", which, if they were accepted, would allow the company to offer different rights to different classes of shareholder.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The effect of this amendment would be that in those cases where a company has more than one class of equity security the right of pre-emption when shares in one of those classes was issued for cash would be restricted to the holders of shares of that class. Holders of shares of any other class of equity securities would have no rights of pre-emption.<br><br>
I fear that I have to make clear that the Government must resist the amendment as it is contrary to the requirements of the directive. I hasten to clarify what that means. The directive establishes certain basic rights of shareholders, with scope for member States to derogate, if they so wish, from the full statement of the general principle. As I shall explain, we have taken full advantage of those derogations. However, the directive goes on to provide shareholders with a wide power to withdraw or remove those basic rights—subject to a maximum five-year limit, although of course such shareholder resolutions may be renewed.<br><br>
The amendment is concerned with the basic statutory duty and goes beyond what
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 150</span>
the directive permits, even taking into account the possible derogations which the directive allows and which we have utilised. However, that is not the end of the matter. If a company wishes to achieve the position that the amendment seeks to achieve, it can put before its shareholders appropriate resolutions at regular intervals to modify the basic statutory rights. I emphasise to my right hon. Friend that that flexibility remains. But the basic statutory rights must comply with the directive. That is our obligation.<br><br>
I will explain why the amendment is contrary to the directive. The relevant provision is article 29 of the directive. We are concerned here only with the first two paragraphs. Paragraph 1, which establishes the basic right, reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"Whenever the capital is increased by consideration in cash, the shares must be offered on a pre-emptive basis to shareholders in proportion to the capital represented by their shares."</p></blockquote>
That is the basic rule. It refers to "shareholders". It does not distinguish between shareholders of different classes. All must have the same right. That is the starting point.<br><br>
Under paragraph 2, however, which permits member States to limit that general principle, there are two derogations. Paragraph 2(<i>a</i>) permits the exclusion of what we call preference shares. In clause 17 of the Bill, preference shares are excluded from the right of pre-emption by the definition of "relevant shares" in subsection (9). That is in line with United Kingdom practice and was, I understand, something which we achieved during negotiations on the directive. So preference shares are outside clause 17. But other shares are within it. So far, therefore, there is no basis for restricting the right of preemption to shareholders of the class involved.<br><br>
Paragraph 2(<i>b</i>), however, provides a limited derogation where companies have different classes of shares. It concerns cases in which the subscribed capital of a company is formed of several classes of shares carrying different rights with regard to voting, or participation either in a distribution within the meaning of article 15, which means dividends, or in a liquidation—in other words, where a company has certain sorts of classes of share capital.<br><br>
The directive, by paragraph 2(<i>b</i>), empowers member States to permit, where
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0087">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 151</span>
the subscribed capital of the companies
<br><blockquote><p>"is increased by issuing new shares in only one of those classes, the right of pre-emption of shareholders of other classes to be exercised only after the exercise of this right by the shareholders of the class in which the new shares are being issued."</p></blockquote>
In other words, the first pre-emptive right accrues to the shareholders of the class involved, but, after that, the shareholders generally have the second right of pre-emption. The rights of the shareholders generally are postponed to the limited extent necessary to make a first pre-emptive offer to shareholders of the particular class.<br><br>
I must emphasise that there is no authority here or anywhere else in the directive for member States to go beyond this and to remove the rights of shareholders generally to a pre-emptive offer. Subsection (2) sets out the mechanism for the limited derogation permitted by paragraph 2(<i>b</i>) of article 29. But that is quite different from the amendment. I hope that my right hon. Friend will accept that.<br><br>
I fully recognise that the basic statutory rules required by the directive differ in a number of important respects from the practice which companies presently follow. One is particularly relevant in the present case. Suppose that a company has two classes of equity—for instance, ordinary and deferred shares—and is considering a rights issue. At present, the company may offer ordinary shares to ordinary shareholders, and deferred shares to deferred shareholders. Under the basic rules that will no longer be possible. Both classes of shares must be offered to all shareholders. Of course, the company may wish to take advantage of the provisions of subsection (2) to make the preliminary pre-emptive offer of ordinary shares to ordinary shareholders, and only subsequently make the general preemptive offer. That also applies to deferred shares. But if there are shares which have not been taken up on the first pre-emptive offer, they must then be offered to shareholders generally.<br><br>
This, indeed, is another difference from present practice, since, where such shares are not taken up on the first offer, the company will allow shareholders of that class to apply for any shares left over. Once again, that is not within paragraph 2(<i>b</i>), because, once share-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 152</span>
holders of that class have received the first pre-emptive offer, the next one must be made to the shareholders generally.<br><br>
Such practices now conflict with the basic statutory rules, but, as I said earlier, if companies wish to continue present practices they have the possibility of seeking, at regular intervals, the consent of their shareholders to a modification of basic statutory rules. Many may wish to do so, and the directive and the Bill permit it.<br><br>
In the light of these circumstances, and the flexibility which is introduced to permit the company to match its own needs, I hope that my right hon. Friend will not press the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that explanation. I wish that it was written into the Bill so that we could all read it at any time and therefore now how to deal with these cases. However, the Minister's later statement that the choice can be made by alteration to the memorandum and articles is very important.<br><br>
I am sorry that the Bill makes this provision. I shall not go through it again, as my hon. Friend has explained perfectly well. But this is one occasion on which I shall not ask leave to withdraw the amendment, because I wish to show my distaste at this provision.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 122, in page 22, line 7,at end add:
<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that any person entitled to receive an offer or be given a notice under the preceding provisions of this subsection may waive that entitlement in writing to the company".</p></blockquote>
The amendment adds words to the end of Clause 17(1)(<i>b</i>). That paragraph provides that the company
<br><blockquote><p>"shall not allot any of those securities"—</p></blockquote>
which are referred to in the subsection 1(<i>a</i>)—
<br><blockquote><p>"to any person unless the period during which any such offer may be accepted has expired or the company has received notice of the acceptance or refusal of every offer so made."</p></blockquote>
It seems to me that it is not necessary that the company should wait that long if the person to whom the offer has been made waives his Tight to think about it for that period of time. There is no reason why, if a man has considered an offer for a day and decided on the way
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0088">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 153</span>
he wants to act, he should not so inform the company, if it is perfectly clear and the information is given in writing.<br><br>
I therefore wish to add to the end of subsection 1(<i>b</i>)the proviso that anyone entitled to receive an offer or to be given a notice under the preceding provisions of the subsection may waive that entitlement in writing to the company—in other words do anything that will simplify the proceedings and let the company get on with the job.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I am in sympathy with my right hon. Friend's desire for simplification. The effect of the amendment would be to make express provision that any person entitled to receive a pre-emptive offer under clause 17(1) would be able to waive his right by writing to the company. This has also been suggested by the Law Society.<br><br>
I entirely agree with my right hon. Friend that it is desirable that a person should be able to waive such a right, as that could well save time and expense for companies. I am advised, as the Law Society suggested in its paper, that such waiving of rights would be possible without an express provision to this effect. I believe that it can already be done. However, whereas the Law Society considered that such a provision might serve to remove any doubts that this is possible, we would be somewhat concerned about stating it because that would imply that it was necessary to state it. That would have ramifications for other civil rights which can be waived. I am sure that my right hon. Friend would not welcome, any more than I, such a prospect. It would introduce a fresh complication. Therefore I hope that he will not press the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed by the latter comments made by my hon. Friend. It had not occurred to me that there would be such an implication from a provision of this nature. Obviously, I should like to look at the matter again. I thought that it was eminently sensible and logical for a man to waive his entitlement and for the company to accept that waiver and not have to wait for a period of time to see whether the

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (4), to which this is an amendment, provides, in effect, that a shareholder with a registered address, for example, outside the United Kingdom, who is not given a United Kingdom address, may receive the order only by notice in the <i>Gazette.</i>We are familiar with provisions about notices in the <i>Gazette</i>at which no one ever looks and we are familiar with the implication that a person knows about such notices. However, I think that in

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 155</span>
this case the notice should be sent by post to the shareholder's registered address. That would happen if the amendment were made.<br><br>
The provision that the offer
<br><blockquote><p>"shall be made by serving it … in the manner in which notices are authorised to be given by regulation 131 "—</p></blockquote>
that is the only regulation mentioned in the subsection at the moment—with the omission of any reference to regulation 132, would require an offer to be served, for example, on each of the joint holders. That is not so now. Thus, by leaving out any mention of regulation 132 in the subsection we are altering the method of service on joint holders. The offer has to be served on both—it is not sufficient to serve one. That is certainly contrary to practice. I think it will give rise to difficulty where the offer is in the form of, for example, a renounceable provisional allotment letter, which when renounced, may pass by delivery—a frequent practice in a rights offer, and where there are renounceable allotment letters.<br><br>
The inclusion of the provisions of regulation 132 would simplify subsection (4).<br><br>
The inclusion of regulation 133 would make clear how an offer is to be made where a member has died or become bankrupt or that such an offer be treated as an offer to the holder for the purposes of subsection (1).<br><br>
This is a purely practical matter. I do not apologise for raising practical points of this sort. They are points which should be within the regulations, and indeed, they are within the regulations, quite outside the statute. Let us apply the whole of the process set out in the regulations and not, by the mention of one, exclude the others.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These two amendments are both concerned with the manner in which a pre-emptive offer under clause 17 may be notified to the relevant shareholders. The Law Society has also suggested that these are points which need consideration and I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for putting them forward.<br><br>
As presently drafted, subsection (4) provides that offers should be made by serving them
<br><blockquote><p>"<i>in</i>the manner in which notices are authorised to be given by regulation 131 of Table A".</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 156</span>
In the case of holders of share warrants, or in certain other circumstances—as set out in regulation 134 of Table A—such as the persons having no registered address in the United Kingdom and having provided no other address in the United Kingdom, the offer can instead be made by means of a notice in the <i>London Gazette.</i><br><br>
On amendment No. 123, my right hon. Friend rightly pointed out that we need also to refer to regulation 132, which provides that a notice may be given by the company to the joint holders of a share by giving notice to the joint holder first named in the register of members in respect of the share. If we did not refer to regulation 132, an offer under clause 17 would have to be served on each of the joint holders. The Law Society has pointed out that this would be contrary to usual practice and could give rise to difficulties. We therefore accept that we should incorporate in subsection (4) the provisions of regulation 132.<br><br>
Amendment No. 123 also refers to regulation "134 "—I think that should be regulation "133"</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. I ask, Sir Stephen, that you accept regulation "134" as being regulation "133" in the amendment. I referred to regulation 133 in my opening remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is that for the general convenience of the Committee? I am relieved, because I have been looking for regulation 133 and could not find it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 17 is concerned with pre-emptive offers. We have already made clear in earlier subsections which people are entitled to receive such offers. On the other hand, regulation 133 is concerned with the way offers are to be made when the relevant shareholder has died or become bankrupt. We agree that, as the Law Society suggests in its paper, we should also refer in subsection (4) to this regulation to make clear the position in such cases.<br><br>
I hope that my right hon. Friend agrees that amendment No. 123 should refer to regulation 131, 132 and 133, for the reasons I have just given. We agree that such an amendment is necessary and I should be happy to undertake to introduce an amendment on Report, in regard to regulation 133—or to support
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0090">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 157</span>
my right hon. Friend in so doing—or to accept amendment No. 123 now and propose an appropriate amendment to it on Report, unless you, Sir Stephen, would consider in this case that a manuscript amendment to my right hon. Friend's amendment would be in order. I suggest this merely to put right this slight clerical aspect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has already agreed to that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Sir Stephen, for accepting that position. On that basis I can accept the amendment.<br><br>
I turn to amendment No. 125 which provides in certain instances—in the case of a holder of a share warrant or when regulation 134 of table A applies—that the person would not be entitled to receive notice of meetings. Instead of allowing companies to make the offer by means of publication in the <i>London Gazette,</i> companies would be required to send the offer by post to the registered address of the person. Companies would still be allowed alternatively to make the offer in the manner in which notices are authorised to be given by regulation 131 of table A. Under the relevant part of regulation 134, the circumstances in which a person would not be entitled to receive notices of meetings are when the person does not have a registered address in the United Kingdom and does not supply an address within the United Kingdom for the giving of notices.<br><br>
It is reasonable to allow companies in these instances to make the offer by publication in the <i>London Gazette.</i>We think that it is feasible, and we do not want to add to the burden on companies in fulfilling the obligation. It is not clear whether a requirement that a notice to be sent to a registered address abroad would require the notice only to be regarded as sent when it would have been delivered in the ordinary course of posting. That is the position for regulation 131 notices. If this were the case it would clearly impose severe burdens on companies. The way of making offers in these circumstances is permitted by the directive under article 29 and in cases where there is no address in the United Kingdom it seems a sensible idea.<br><br>
We also consider that it is reasonable in the case of owners of share warrants.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 158</span>
Bearer shares are rare in this country but under section 83 of the Companies Act 1948 a company limited by shares can, if so authorised by its articles, issue a warrant stating that bearer is entitled to a stated number of fully paid-up shares, and we therefore need to make provision for them.<br><br>
I cannot, therefore, support amendment No. 125, as we consider that it would place an unnecessary burden on companies. I hope that on the basis of my explanation, my right hon. Friend will not press amendment No. 125.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept what my hon. Friend says about amendment No. 125 and I shall not seek to press the matter further. May I put right the wording of amendment No. 123? I suggest, Sir Stephen, that the Committee agree to amendment No. 123 in the following form: leave out "regulation 131" and insert "regulations 131, 132 and 133".</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are drafting amendments which permit a simplification in other parts of the clause. Amendment No. 46 provides a definition of allotment of equity securities of a particular class, as well as the existing definition of allot-

ment of equity securities. In both cases, where we speak of allotment when convertible securities and so on are concerned, it is taken to mean the grant of a right to convert or subscribe, and not the occasion subsequently when the right is exercised and shares are allotted upon conversion or subscription.<br><br>
The subsection already establishes this with a definition of allotment of equity securities, but it does not, as the clause stands, do the same for allotment of equity securities of a particular class. It is sensible and desirable for the drafting of the Bill that it should, hence the amendment.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 47 and 48 relate to the definition of a class of shares at lines 3 to 7 on page 24 of the Bill at the end of subsection (9). The definition is defective. It purports to define a class of relevant shares but does so in terms of either relevant shares or relevant employee shares, which are two mutually exclusive categories. What is needed is a definition of class of both kinds of shares. The easiest and most straightforward way of achieving this is to remove the references to "relevant" or "levant employee" and refer simply to "shares". That is what the amendment does.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 126, in page 24, line 8, leave out subsection (10) and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"(10) Where a company is prohibited by any enactment, or by any provision of a foreign law, from offering any equity security to any person as required by the clause, or from allotting any such security pursuant to any such offer (or is so prohibited except subject to the satisfaction of conditions which, in the opinion of the company, it would be unduly burdensome to comply with). it shall be entitled. if and to the extent that such enactment or law permits-
<br><blockquote><p>(<i>a</i>)where the prohibition or conditions relate to the way in which an offer is made, to make the offer in such way as it thinks fit, or"</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
This is to re-write subsection (10) of clause 17. The present subsection (10) deals with the case of a shareholder who
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 160</span>
is prevented by any enactment from receiving the shares allotted to him. Subsection (10) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"This section is without prejudice to any enactment "—</p></blockquote>
I stress the word "enactment"—
<br><blockquote><p>"by virtue of which a company is prohibited (whether generally or in specified circumstances) from offering or allotting equity securities to any person; and, where a company cannot by virtue of any such enactment offer or allot equity securities to a holder of relevant shares or relevant employee shares, this section shall have effect as if the shares held by that holder were not relevant shares or relevant employee shares."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, the holder can never receive those shares.<br><br>
That is contrary to present practice if we understand "enactment" to include any enactment of foreign law, of law outside this country. I do not know whether it happens, but it may be that an American State forbids its citizens to hold shares in a United Kingdom company. This is hypothetical, but it could happen. In such a case, what is done at present is to put those shares into trust with a nominee who, according to our law, is entitled to them but to whom, according to foreign law, the company cannot offer them. That seems a very fair way of dealing with the matter. The company would be prevented from doing so under the Bill as it stands, and would, as I understand it, be obliged to offer those shares to the remaining shareholders of the company.<br><br>
The amendment provides that where a company is prohibited in this way by any enactment
<br><blockquote><p>"or by any provision of a foreign law"</p></blockquote>
—I have expressed it specifically there rather than left it for the courts to decide what is meant by the word "enactment"—
<br><blockquote><p>"from offering any equity security to any person as required by the clause"</p></blockquote>
—that should read "section" rather than "clause" because it will be a section when the Bill becomes an Act—
<br><blockquote><p>"or from allotting any such security pursuant to any such offer (or is so prohibited except subject to the satisfaction of conditions which, in the opinion of the company, it would he unduly burdensome to comply with), it shall be entitled"</p></blockquote>
—I shall not quote the clause but instead summarise it—to hold the shares in trust for the shareholder who is precluded in this way from receiving them.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0092">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 161</span>
That seems a fair way of dealing with the unfortunate position of the shareholder who is precluded by some provision of law from receiving those shares to which he is clearly entitled.<br><br>
As subsection (10) stands, it seems to take away and confiscate a right which is quite validly vested in some shareholder. I would like to put that right by the amendment, which I hope will be acceptable to the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The effect of my right hon. Friend's amendment is to replace subsection (10) with a much broader provision. The Law Society of England and Wales proposed exactly such a provision for a number of reasons, and I wish to deal first with the most important one, namely, the present practice of selling rights to new shares where foreign legislation makes such offers of rights difficult.<br><br>
Considerable attention has been paid to the question of how the provisions of the Bill will affect the practice presently adopted by public companies which have certain foreign shareholders. The issue is mainly discussed in terms of the United States of America, but it is not necessarily confined to America. The problem is that the laws of these foreign countries lay down stringent or onerous requirements which the companies have to comply with before they can offer their shares to residents or citizens of those countries. So, if companies are required by United Kingdom law to make pre-emptive offers to all their shareholders, regardless of nationality or residence, we may be forcing them into very considerable expense and diversion of management effort because they will necessarily have to comply with foreign requirements before they can make the offers to shareholders in those countries that we require.<br><br>
That is the problem, and it is a very real one. The American Securities and Exchange Commission's filing and disclosure requirements for equity securities are very strict and onerous and are not above criticism from American companies. Compliance with them could cost hundreds of thousands of pounds and involve disclosure of information on a scale far in excess of anything known in this country. The calls on senior management time can be imagined.<br><br>
In present circumstances, there is no
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 162</span>
statutory requirement to make preemptive offers to all shareholders, but the Stock Exchange has a similar requirement, and it is undoubtedly recognised as only fair and reasonable that existing shareholders should have such rights.<br><br>
How, then, does one avoid the problems involved in making offers to foreign shareholders? I understand that in, say, a rights issue, the company will set aside the proportion of shares to which foreign shareholders would otherwise be entitled, and instead of offering them at the rights issue paid, with its usual built-in discount, the company will sell the rights to those shares in the market and pay the proceeds to the foreign shareholders. In turn, they can, if they wish to maintain their proportionate stake in the company, use those proceeds to offset the cost of a purchase in the market. They should be no worse off than shareholders who are able to subscribe at the preferential rate, as the proceeds of the sale of the rights should equal the difference between the market price and the rights issue price.<br><br>
It seems to me that this is a satisfactory and fair way of reconciling the conflicting interests in these cases. It does, of course, turn on the availability of a market in the shares and in the rights.<br><br>
We come now to the key issue. How far does the Bill and, behind the Bill, the directive permit such a 'practice to continue? In brief, both the directive and the Bill allow companies to continue such a practice, provided that the company gets the agreement of its shareholders by a special resolution.<br><br>
For the longer answer, the starting point is the directive, article 29, paragraph 1. This establishes the pre-emptive rights of shareholders generally, and does not distinguish between foreign and domestic shareholders. They all have the same rights. However, the directive, having laid down this general rule, permits member States to provide for major derogations. The two in question are provided by paragraphs 4 and 5 of article 29, and permit complete or partial derogation from the general rule if the derogation is approved by the shareholders in general meeting. A special majority is required, and in these cases by article 40(1), namely, two-thirds of the votes represented at the meeting.<br><br>
In the Bill, the general rule is em-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0093">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 163</span>
bodied in clause 17, which does not distinguish between United Kingdom and foreign shareholders. However, in clause 18 full provision is made for the derogations permitted by the directive, with the qualified majority being translated into a special majority requiring a three-quarters majority of those present and voting.<br><br>
The effect of all this is that if companies wish to substitute a cash sum for foreign shareholders instead of an offer, on a pre-emptive basis, of shares being offered to other shareholders, subject to obtaining shareholder consent they will be able to do so. Shareholder consent can last for a maximum of five years under the Bill and the directive, and so annual resolutions at the general meeting will not be necessary.<br><br>
If one looks at the position under the directive and the Bill, it is hard to fault. Shareholders have the same rights, whether residents or citizens of this country, the Community or elsewhere. Subject to clear shareholder consent, this general rule may be modified in any way known, whether to exclude foreign shareholders or whatever. The provision is aimed at protecting shareholder rights unless the shareholders agree clearly to some other arrangements. There is therefore nothing in the Bill to prevent the continuation of the present practice of offering cash to foreign shareholders instead of shares.<br><br>
I now turn to the effect of the proposed amendment in this case. The amendment would give directors the right in extreme cases to sell the rights for the benefit of the foreign shareholders, rather than offering them the shares. There is a short reply to this point. It is not consistent with the directive. If shareholders' rights of preemption are to be withheld, shareholders must agree. It is not for the directors to withdraw those rights.<br><br>
That is the heart of the matter. The Law Society proposal would allow directors to override the rights of shareholders, and the directive rules that out. That does not mean that the present practice will have to stop, only that it requires clear shareholder consent to modify the basic statutory rules. But those basic statutory rules must meet the demands of the directive.<br><br>
I do hope that that provides a full answer to the main point that lies behind
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 164</span>
the amendment. However, a number of other points have been raised and I should like to deal briefly with those.<br><br>
First, there is the question of selling rights and paying the proceeds into blocked accounts, when, for example, exchange control prevents the offer being made. With the almost complete removal of exchange control, the point has lost some of its significance. But there remains, at least for the immediate future, the case of Rhodesia, though I hope that that shortly will also be resolved.<br><br>
The effect of the clause is that in such cases the basic statutory rules do not permit the sale of rights and the crediting of the proceeds to blocked accounts, but once again it would be open to the company's shareholders to agree to such an arrangement. The alternative is to lay down a basic statutory rule requiring directors to do that, but I think that it is more natural to leave the choice of whether to have such a discretion to the company itself.<br><br>
Finally, the Law Society has asked what the position will be if the prohibition is imposed or lifted after the date of the offer and before it closes. This involves a large number of assumptions about the form in which the other statutory enactment containing the prohibition is drafted. The interrelationship between the two is a matter of statutory construction, and in the absence of one of the statutes that construction cannot be straightforward. However, let me set out the main principles as they are contained in the Bill.<br><br>
When another prohibition is lifted, the critical time is when the company makes the pre-emptive offer. If at that time the prohibition is in force, it will not make the offer to the people covered by it. Having made the offer, the company is then free, after that offer has been accepted or rejected, or after a certain amount of time has elapsed, to allot any shares which have not been taken up.<br><br>
The critical time is the making of the offer, as it is that making of the offer that eventually frees the company to make other offers. As for the other case, unless a prohibition is imposed after the offer is made, the case turns on the terms of the prohibition. It may well be that the prohibition prevents the company from going on with any allotment to the people who are covered.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0094">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 165</span>
Any contract would be frustrated by supervening illegality, but that has little to do with the present provision and much more to do with the terms of the prohibitions.<br><br>
I hope that that explanation answers the point, at least in principle, and will be of help to my right hon. Friend and to the Law Society.<br><br>
I fear that I have spoken at length, but a number of separate complex and important issues have been raised which I felt should be dealt with fully, particularly as the amendment is not consistent with the directive. In those circumstances, and in the light of what I have said, I hope that my right hon. Friend will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my hon. Friend's explanation, but I am afraid that it does not clear up a number of matters which arise on subsection (10) as drafted.<br><br>
Subsection (10) has two parts, both of which my amendment seeks to remedy. The first part, up to the semi-colon, reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"This section is without prejudice to any enactment by virtue of which a company is prohibited … from offering or allotting equity securities to any person".</p></blockquote>
What is meant by "enactment" is not clear. My hon. Friend has treated it as applying to foreign law as well as to the law of this country, but that is not at all certain, if one looks up the definition of "enactment". Normally, it is considered to mean either primary or secondary legislation of this country. If it is to apply to foreign law, that should be made perfectly clear in the subsection.<br><br>
The meaning is thrown into greater doubt by the fact that the following words are:
<br><blockquote><p>"by virtue of which a company is prohibited from"</p></blockquote>
doing something. Is a company in this country prohibited from doing something by the laws of a foreign country? The implication here seems to be that there must be an effective prohibition on a company from taking such action by an enactment of this country. If we are to deal with the matter on the basis that a foreign law is preventing the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 166</span>
company from doing what it wishes to do, that should be made perfectly clear in the subsection.<br><br>
I call attention again to the fact that the subsection deals with what the company is prohibited from doing—not what the shareholder is unable to do by reason of the law applying to him in some foreign country.<br><br>
I gather, then, that it is without prejudice to any enactment that the company can treat the shares held by this foreign shareholder as relevant shares. If the subsection is without prejudice to any foreign enactment, the company can disregard that foreign enactment—if I understand the first part of the subsection correctly.<br><br>
The subsection then says, in the second half, that
<br><blockquote><p>"where a company cannot by virtue of any such enactment offer or allot equity securities to a holder of relevant shares or relevant emnlovee shares, this section shall have effect as if the shares held by that holder were not relevant shares".</p></blockquote>
If I read that correctly, that means that the rights issue need not be offered to the holder of those shares because they can be treated as irrelevant shares—they are not relevant shares. The principle of offering every relevant shareholder the same does not then apply.<br><br>
Does this really mean that if the company looks down its list and finds that a shareholder is living in California—I nick California because it is the most likely State to have restrictions of this kind—that shareholder will not be offered those pre-emption rights, and he will be treated as a non-shareholder for that purpose? That is what subsection (10) says quite clearly:
<br><blockquote><p>"this section shall have effect as if the shares held by that holder were not relevant shares or relevant employee shares".</p></blockquote>
I do not think that the matter can be left like that. It is possible that it could be cleared up by an appropriate resolution under clause 18, which, after all, will last far only five years. But it is a little oppressive to expect someone who wishes to purchase shares in a company, or even to be an original subscriber to the company or to take up a previous issue—not a rights issue—by the company, to examine the records of the company to see whether there is a special resolution of this sort and whether it was passed less than five years ago. We seem
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0095">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 167</span>
to be placing a burden on those who wish to make investments.<br><br>
Under the present practice, any shareholder of a company can rely on having the proceeds of his shares at least kept for him if the value of those shares increases by a rights issue. While I do not say that the drafting of amendment No. 126 is by any means perfect, I think it resolves many of the problems. Certainly, I do not think that subsection (10) can remain as it stands without becoming an invitation to litigation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has considerable experience in these matters, and, as he knows, I am always prepared to listen very carefully to all the points he raises.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend's first point was about the word "enactment". I am advised that this word has an accepted meaning in United Kingdom law and that its use here does not raise any difficulties. I hope that my right hon. Friend will accept that assurance. I emphasise that subsection (10) applies only to United Kingdom enactments. We say nothing of foreign enactments which prohibit such offers.<br><br>
On the more general question of the prohibition of an offer by foreign law, I know of no example of a foreign prohibition. I am also unwilling to accept that a foreign law can legitimately prohibit a British company from doing something of this kind which is required under the law of this country.<br><br>
I have already explained why it is not possible to accept amendment No. 126. However, I appreciate how complicated these matters are, and I am prepared to consider further the necessity of bringing forward an amendment to relieve companies of the obligation to make an offer under clause 17 to a shareholder where the law applicable to him prohibits such an offer. I am not convinced of the necessity or wisdom of such an amendment, but I promise to give careful consideration to this matter and to other points my right hon. Friend has raised. On that basis, I hope that he will not press his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could press my hon. Friend an inch further. I am grateful to him for saying that he will reconsider the matter and consider whether subsection (10) could be usefully
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 168</span>
amended. But may I ask his assurance that, if he is unable to do anything about the matter on Report, he will let the members of the Committee, rather than just the one Member who has made the proposal, know in time for them to consider whether they themselves wish to raise the matter again on Report by means of an appropriate amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am, naturally, anxious to please my right hon. Friend, who is making a great contribution to the work of the Committee. The point is of considerable complexity. I undertake that, should I not be able to bring forward an amendment such as I have described on Report, I should certainly let my right hon. Friend know, probably in some detail, and I should also let other members of the Committee know.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very obliged to my hon. Friend. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The key amendments are the first two; the others follow from them. Clauses 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24 make various provisions concerning payment for share capital. In each case where a company allots shares in contravention of the provisions there may be a liability on the allottee to pay certain sums to the company.<br><br>
The purpose of amendment No. 131 is to restate the present provision of clause 20(4) in such a way that it can apply also in clauses 21, 22, 23 and 24. Hence, amendments Nos. 133, 135, 139 and 156, in each of those clauses, merely refer back to the new subsection (4) of clause 20 proposed by amendment No. 131.<br><br>
I hope that the considerable skill of the draftsman in finding an appropriate formulation will be welcomed. Practitioners will therefore have to refer to and grapple with only one provision instead of five, each with a minor but real difference.<br><br>
I now turn to amendment No. 132, which is an entirely new provision. In the past, doubts were expressed about the exact meaning of "holder" of shares, particularly in clause 20 but also in clauses 21 to 24. The point is that when they reach the position of difficulty they should be liable, in exactly the same way as any other member, in respect of shares not properly allotted or paid up. That they have not been finally entered on the register of members is no reason why they should escape liability if all the other conditions are met.<br><br>
Therefore, the new subsection extends the definition to such people. In both cases the people involved are in substance the owners of the shares, and it is right that they should not be exempted from liability for shares that have not been properly paid up. Amendment No. 131 seeks to close that gap.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i>That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had almost lapsed into my normal somnolence, Sir Stephen, but the expedition with which you dealt with the proceedings has brought me to my feet.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0099">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 175</span>
There is one matter which puzzles me—in fact, I am doubly puzzled—relating to subsection (4) which requires the valuation mentioned in the clause for non-cash assets to be carried out by an independent person. An independent person is defined as
<br><blockquote><p>"a person qualified at the time of the report to be appointed or continue to be auditor".</p></blockquote>
There may be independent persons who are not qualified to be auditors. They may lack the professional qualifications. I assume that what the draftsmen had in mind was section 161 of the 1948 Act. But that contains two kinds of qualification—the professional qualifications and other qualifications relating to independence.<br><br>
Equally, I imagine that there might be persons qualified to be auditors who cannot be said to be independent. That would depend upon the circumstances of each case.<br><br>
Presumably, the criterion of independence is whether the person concerned has any interest which conflicts or might conflict with his duty to report fairly. I should have thought that the intention was that there should be a person who was both qualified to be an auditor and independent who would make the valuation. Therefore, that was the first matter that puzzled me.<br><br>
However, I am doubly puzzled because I notice that the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), with his usual assiduity, has been through the memorandum prepared by the Law Society and the Senate and has duly tabled an amendment on almost all the points which they made up to this stage, but, unless I am being more than unduly obtuse, I do not believe that he has tabled an amendment on this point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am quite prepared to accept that criticism. The fact is that the Committee stage is going so well that I have not caught up with that, but I am saving it for Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My puzzlement is resolved, because I could not believe that the right hon. Gentleman had overlooked this point—it would have been totally out of character—and I thought that he must have some good reason for disagreeing with it. However, that explains the position.<br><br>
Therefore, on the other point,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 176</span>
wonder whether my curiosity arises from ignorance, although—this comforts me—it is a curiosity obviously shared by the Law Society and the Senate, and I should be grateful if the Minister would resolve it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to refer to the points raised by the right hon. and learned Member for Warley, West (Mr. Archer). The Law Society has suggested that the reference in subsection (4), to which the right hon. and learned Gentleman referred, to
<br><blockquote><p>"an independent person, that is to say, a person qualified at the time of the report to be appointed or continue to be auditor of the company"</p></blockquote>
is unsatisfactory, because there are independent persons who are not qualified to be auditors and there may be persons qualified to be auditors who are not independent. I believe that that was the main point raised by the right hon. and learned Gentleman.<br><br>
I should stress that the word "independent" is only a label, albeit one that is important. It is certainly not intended to imply that a person qualified to be auditor of the company is the only sort of person who could be independent. However, we are satisfied that the phrase as drafted does not carry this implication. On the other hand, it does carry some meaning.<br><br>
Section 161 of the 1948 Act sets out various provisions about the appointment of people as auditors. For example, as well as setting out the necessary professional qualifications that must have been obtained—again, this was a point raised by the right hon. and learned Gentleman—the section states that
<br><blockquote><p>"an officer or servant of the company"</p></blockquote>
and such like cannot be appointed as auditor. Auditors have to be independent and, essentially, that is what the label "independent" in subsection (4) refers to.<br><br>
The most important activity for the protection of shareholders or creditors is, surely, the auditing of accounts. It cannot seriously be suggested that we need greater safeguards for valuations under clause 24 than we do for the auditing of accounts. As I have pointed out, auditors have to be members of certain professional bodies and such bodies have their own codes of conduct. Therefore, I am quite sure that the pro-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0100">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 177</span>
vision in subsection (4) that the valuation report be made by a person
<br><blockquote><p>"qualified … to be appointed or continue to be an auditor of the company"</p></blockquote>
would sufficiently ensure the independence of the values and does not call for further qualifications as the Law Society has suggested.<br><br>
The Law Society has also made the point that, as drafted, an auditor of the company would be able to make the valuation and report required by clause 24 but not to act as a sub-valuer. We accept that this is an anomaly and have brought forward amendment No. 61 to meet the point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am still not wholly convinced that one might not have a person who was qualified to be an auditor who was, nevertheless, not independent in the sense in which most of us in everyday life use that term and as we would expect it to be used in the Bill. However, I accept that that would be a criticism of section 161 and of the qualifications for auditors rather than for values. Therefore, for the present at least, I am content to leave the matter there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I suggest to the right hon. and learned Gentleman that the difficulty arises from the words "that is to say".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not think that that is totally where the difficulty arises. I think that, in any event, some of us might have wished to provide a double qualification—first someone qualified to be an auditor and, secondly, someone who is independent. A situation could
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 178</span>
arise in which there is a person who is not an officer or servant of the company and who is not in the employment of an officer or servant of the company, who may yet, in ordinary language and as a matter of merit, not be said to be independent. But that, again, is not something that I wish to pursue today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend said that amendment No. 61 solved the problem about the sub-values. Amendment No. 61 merely adds a little to subsection (11), whereas the problem raised is why, if an auditor is qualified to make the valuation and the report he is not qualified to act as a sub-values. I cannot see how amendment No. 6 solves that problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eyre</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I realise from the remarks made by my right hon. Friend and by the right hon. and learned Member for Warley, West (Mr. Archer) that we need to look at subsection (4) carefully and consider all the points that have been made. We shall do so, having in mind the desire to achieve some improvement if that is at all possible. If it proves possible to deal with these points and to produce a better situation, I shall see that proposals to that effect are brought forward at a later stage.</span></p>
<p><i>Clause 24, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p><i>Clause 25 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p>Further consideration adjourned.—[<i>Mr. Parkinson.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Adjourned accordingly at three minutes to One o'clock till Thursday 15 November 1979 at half-past Ten o'clock.</i></p>
