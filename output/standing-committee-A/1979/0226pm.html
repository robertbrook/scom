</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Happily, the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) has saved the Committee a long speech from
	<span class='label label-info column'>700</span>
me because he has covered more than half of the points that I should have made. He has done so cogently, persuasively and reasonably. The arguments are not only irrefutable but impeccable, and the Committee should be grateful for the service that the hon. Gentleman has rendered in all those respects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the hon. Gentleman's amendments rather than my own in some ways, because they are more comprehensive. Not only do they establish the right of a person not to belong to a trade union but they also achieve what mine do not. They protect those rights from being circumvented by contractual arrangements. That is highly desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment confines itself to establishing the right of an individual not to belong to a union "on any grounds whatsoever". That principle is enshrined in amendment No. 30. Amendment No. 31 is consequential in that it seeks to omit the new subsections (3B), (3C) and (3D). These are not necessary if an employee cannot be dismissed fairly for not belonging to a union. Subsection (3) should e taken out because that is unnecessary for the same reason. If an employee is not covered by a union membership agreement, he will not take part in the ballot because he will not be entitled to vote, he will not be a member, and therefore that subsection is not necessary. The remaining three amendments are consequential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim of these amendments, whether mine or those put down by the hon. Member for Rochdale, is the same. All seek to undermine and eventually to abolish the closed shop. There is no doubt about that. The justification for seeking to achieve that aim has been aired so often that it is unnecessary to go further than to summarise the arguments that arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Foremost is the opportunity that exists for abuse in closed shops. Closed shops constitute a coercive power in the hands of trade union officials. That coercive power enables officials to threaten an individual with the loss of his job and therefore his livelihood; and it is also open to misuse. The power is considerable yet it is not essential—if it is argued that it is—for the maintenance of control and discipline over members. It is not a necessary power; nor is it necessary for furtherance of the commercial prospects of an undertaking. On the other hand, in the wrong hands, the temptation exists
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0879">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>701</span>
to use that power for political, racial or even corrupt purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A second justification for abolishing the closed shop is that it forces men to join what has hitherto been a voluntary association. It is a proud claim of the trade union movement that it has always been a voluntary association. I understand that, as the hon. Member for Rochdale said, there is an argument that one should contribute to the costs of a body that provides benefits that one enjoys. But some of those benefits are questionable in the minds of many people who belong to trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Specifically, there are at least 16 trade unions, covering approximately half of all trade union members, which have rules that pledge them to some form of Socialism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member says "Good". But at least a third of the electorate at the last general election said "Bad", and voted accordingly. It is difficult to understand why that third should be forced to support trade unions in a closed shop situation, if there is one, if they have rules of that sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to sidetrack for a moment to ram the point home. It is interesting to see the extent and speed with which union membership agreements have grown in recent years. In the mid-1960s 3/4; million people were in such arrangements. At present, according to the 	<i>Employment Gazette</i> that came out in January, the number has grown to 5.2 million. Those who have recently conducted research on the subject say that that figure is probably considerably underestimated because, if one adds unwritten agreements, the figure is more likely to be between 7 million and 9 million. Therefore, some 30 per cent. to 40 per cent. of the 22 million who form the work force of this country are now forced to belong to closed shops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Returning to the argument against closed shops, I add that they deny employees certain basic rights—not least, the right to belong to a union of their own choice. But there are other arguments. Closed shops create a monopoly in the supply of labour. They deny a trade union member the opportunity to leave if he is dissatisfied with the union of which he has been forced to become
	<span class='label label-info column'>702</span>
member or if he disagrees with the way that the union is run.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose, for example, that the union increases subscriptions. That is not fanciful. In February 1979, when a closed shop arrangement was made by the Strathclyde region council, membership subscriptions increased to about £70,000 in that year. I can understand that a member of NALGO in that situation might say "This is a high price for me to have to pay for the alleged benefits that I am offered. Why should I not resign and get out?" But he cannot if he wishes to continue to work in that particular job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should not a trade unionist resign if he feels that the union is inefficient or is inadequately run? It can be argued that he has his democratic right to remove the leadership. But perhaps he cannot do that. Why should he not have the option of resigning? Perhaps he feels that the leadership has been arbitrary or misguided. There can be any one of a number of reasons. But he cannot work elsewhere without his union card, and he therefore loses his way of earning his living.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are some of the political, libertarian and economic objections which give cause for disposing of the closed shop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in some difficulty, and I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman could assist the Committee. He has indicated that he fully supports the arguments put forward by the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) this morning. The hon. Member for Rochdale indicated that he wished us to move towards making the closed shop illegal. Yet, on the other hand, he indicated that he had no objection to a closed shop if everyone in the shop wanted that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek to ascertain whether there is unanimity between the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) and the hon. Member for Rochdale on that difficult point. I cannot grasp how we can have voluntary closed shop agreements, where everyone wants to be in the union, and, on the other hand, outlaw the closed shop. If the hon. Gentleman will tell me where he stands, I shall be in a better position to judge how much unanimity there is between the two hon. Gentlemen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can answer that very easily by saying that there is no difference of opinion between the hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0880">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>703</span>
Member for Rochdale and myself. The hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) does not correctly represent what the hon. Member for Rochdale said. As I understood the latter, he said that he had no objection to 100 per cent. membership if 100 per cent. of the members wanted it. But that would not necessarily exclude anyone from leaving the union at some stage so that membership was 99 per cent or 98 per cent. If that is correct I see the hon. Member for Rochdale nodding—I am entirely in agreement with him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest respect what has been suggested is impossible. One cannot outlaw the closed shop by making it illegal and then allow closed shops to exist. I am sure that the Under-Secretary will help us all with his great knowledge of law and tell us how, if something is illegal in some situations, it can then be made legal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cyril Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I said this morning was exactly as stated by the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst). I said that I believed that the closed shop was incompatible with individual liberty and should be made illegal. I then said—and I say it again now—that if 100 per cent. of a work force wish to belong to a union, so be it. That is their business. I do not object to that. Making the closed shop illegal does not prevent that happening. But it is for them to decide whether they wish to join, and therefore I would outlaw the closed shop and allow workers to please themselves whether they are members of a union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand foursquare with the hon. Member for Rochdale. I do not believe that I can improve on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must press the hon. Gentleman to tell the Committee how something that is made illegal can be brought into legality because someone says that he does not mind that happening. If Parliament declares something illegal, then, surely, the hon. Gentleman must accept that it is illegal and that no special cases can be made simply because a group may want to do so. We could give plenty of examples in other areas where people appearing before a court would like to present such an argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the best way to answer the hon. Gentleman is to draw his
	<span class='label label-info column'>704</span>
attention to the fact that it is made "illegal" by the clause only in the sense that, if somebody loses his job as a result of not being a member of a closed shop, the dismissal will be found to have been unfair only if he was dismissed.
	<br><blockquote><p>"on grounds of conscience or other deeply-held personal conviction",</p></blockquote>
whereas the hon. Member for Rochdale and I say that people will be a unfairly dismissed if they are not members on any grounds whatsoever. That is the distinction between the hon. Member's standpoint and mine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not clear up the dilemma. The hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) says that it is OK provided that it is voluntary. He is nodding his head in agreement. The hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) wants it illegal. If something is illegal—I think that is what he said—it is no defence in law to say "I have done something illegally but I did it voluntarily".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take an extreme example, there is no statute which says that murder is illegal, but it tends to be illegal under the common law. It is no defence to say "I committed murder, but I did it quite voluntarily". There is a dichotomy between the two hon. Members, and I think that that ought to be cleared up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that there is no dichotomy. The interpretation of the word "illegal" is not quite what I said in my opening remarks. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman had then returned to the Committee, but I said that my aim—which I thought was also the aim of the hon. Member for Rochdale—was both to undermine and to abolish by giving certain rights to individuals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cyril Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems that we are bandying words. Certain members of the Committee are trying to twist an argument between two principles. One is a closed shop. Our amendment says that it should be illegal to force a man to join a union against his will. If one accepted that amendment, a closed shop would not be possible. 100 per cent. membership of a union within a shop does not mean that that is a closed shop. It simply means that 100 per cent. of the employees are members of a union. That is not the same thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0881">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>705</span>
My amendment seeks to ensure that workers can please themselves whether they join the union. Only if they exercise their right in favour of being in a union would there be not a closed shop but 100 per cent, membership of the union in a shop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member. I hope that now makes the matter as clear as daylight to Opposition Members who are puzzling with this semantic problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I address myself for a moment to the Government's answer to this problem. As I understand it, the Government have certain objections to the closed shop in principle, but in practice it is more expedient to move in a more gentle fashion and to "see how we go". I do not believe that this is a correct attitude. The Government's palliative—their solution—effectively says to an individual who is allegedly unfairly dismissed that he must go to an industrial tribunal and bare his heart and soul in front of lawyers, trade union officials and representatives of the management for whom he works, and that if he can convince them that he has deeply-held grounds of conscience, he will be found to have been improperly dismissed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Giles Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, those are very wide exemptions. The objection of the Opposition to the clause is that they are so wide that it is very easy to get through. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman raises the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will not be quite so surprised when I say why I raise this point. My reason is that I have always thought that it is axiomatic in our history that we do not expect individuals to be badgered to prove their religious beliefs. Now, on top of the legislation which was passed by the previous Government, which confined grounds for exemption to religious beliefs, a man must present himself before industrial tribunals, and that will be extended. He has not only perhaps to consider the defence of his religious beliefs, but he has also to show that he has profound convictions and deep beliefs. I believe that it is alien to the proper respect for the individual that we should introduce this factor into the examination of a man's conduct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>706</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that really true? In times of war and conscription, did we not do precisely that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept that there is an analogy here between what the nation requires for its survival and what a trade union may require, if that is the case, for its survival. As I shall say in a moment, I do not accept that that is the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Needham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the point is slightly different. Conscientious or religious objection in time of war is no defence whatsoever. Here, however, the whole question is that conscientious or religious objection will be a defence. The point surely is that the cases are not parallel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what my hon. Friend says. There is no parallel, but I go further and say that, even if there were a parallel, this should not be required of an individual in times of peace, anyhow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I address myself for a moment to the international factors. I hope that when my right hon. Friend replies to this debate, he will have something to say on what the European Convention on Human Rights will say on this matter. I appreciate that under the existing rules, the Government are not allowed to reveal any knowledge that they may have. But if the judgment comes down in favour of there being a right not to belong to a trade union, will we then require further legislation, or has my right hon. Friend grounds for saying that freedom of thought, conscience, expression and association are properly and adequately protected within what will be the European understanding of those concepts?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the findings make it clear that unionists and non-unionists will be treated alike in a way that will satisfy the European court? I take it that we do not want a second round of legislation dealing with the rights of individuals as they are affected by the closed shop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned in an intervention in the speech of the hon. Member for Rochdale that the European Commission had made a declaration on 3 February 1970. I hope that perhaps my right hon. Friend will say something about the implications of that declaration. Even if it was not a binding declaration in the sense that the case being heard in Strasbourg no doubt will be if the Strasbourg finding is con-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0882">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>707</span>
sistent with that declaration, it will not be consistent with this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members are happy to make references to the need for closed shops and to the respectable nature of closed shops, but the Committee ought to take on board the fact that it has not always been so, I should have thought that in the early days of the Labour movement the closed shop as a concept was something of an embarrassment and that trade union leaders such as Arthur Deakin would have much preferred to see the phrase "100 per cent. trade union membership" in the way in which the hon. Member for Rochdale used and discussed it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I doubt whether I have heard any of my hon. Friends raise the issue of the closed shop. I think that it is the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) who have referred to closed shops. The legislation which we are seeking to amend refers to union membership agreements, which are a very different matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the right hon. Gentleman, that is not a distinction without a difference. He is making a semantic point. The fact that in the early days of the trade union movement the expression used was "100 per cent. trade union membership" reflected an unease, because in those days people were well aware of the fact that if anything beyond that—a union membership agreement, if the right hon. Gentleman prefers that phrase—had come into existence, it would very likely have been forbidden. It is important to consider the motives of people in those days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those were days when some people were less well advantaged. Indeed many, in industrial terms, were deprived, financially weak and socially disadvantaged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that "exploited" is the word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exploited—I thank the hon. Gentleman very much. They were exploited, and no one in those days, if he had any sense or decency, wanted to support that exploitation. But that former harsh world where power lay with employers to exploit has not existed in this country for at least two generations. I should have thought that no one on either side of the Committee would regret its
	<span class='label label-info column'>708</span>
passing, but it passed—it did not continue—without the creation of closed shops or union membership agreements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman concede that the passing of exploitation—although I doubt whether it has passed entirely—was primarily the result of the activities of the trade unions, particularly in those areas where they achieved, if not 100 per cent. trade union membership, majority trade union membership?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I concede that happily. I do not think that there can be any doubt about it. I should have regarded that as common ground between us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But exploitation passed without closed shops. Therefore, one must ask oneself what the purpose is of having such arrangements now, since they were not required in the days when the trade union movement was fighting hard for the interests of its members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may give the hon. Gentleman an example from last year under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act. I attended a pilot course run by the TUC for the printing industry, and I became the health and safety representative. We had the problem on our newspaper that plates were breaking up at speed on the run. These lead plates would fly off like shrapnel. We said that the unit on the press where this was happening would not run until we had a report from our technical director. We used to have meetings with him, and he said to me "Whenever that happens, you say that the unit does not run until I have inspected it", and he was the technical expert. We did that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The management did not accept our explanation. There was an article in 	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> about it, and it developed into an industrial dispute. The management on that night said "If you don't run that press, we will shut down the publication", which it did. We carried on producing the newspaper. For three days we produced that newspaper unofficially, without any management. The management said "We are in dispute. We do not want you to touch the newspaper", but we printed it for three days, and 	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> article said "We cannot understand why these people are in dispute. They are not asking for more money". In its

	<span class='label label-info column'>709</span>
view, the only reason for industrial action was a demand for more money. We were in dispute for reasons of health and safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was an example last year where, if we had had no organisation, a firm would have victimized us for reasons of health and safety. We need the strength of that trade union organisation even now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can well understand the hon. Gentleman arguing that the closed shop performed a useful purpose in a particular situation. Equally, I can well understand that some employers will argue that it is a convenient arrangement. But that in no way overcomes the objections against it in principle of the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) and myself. There need to be alternative ways of achieving the result which, clearly, was a beneficial one in the example given by the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth is that clause 6 sanctions a practice which ought not to be sanctioned. The justifications whatever they may be—expediency, convenience, usage—are still not sufficient because the price is that a member of a trade union is placed in the power of trade union officials thereby losing his freedom and liberty to do many of the things that he wishes to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a closed shop, the situation is simple. The employer has responsibility without power and the trade unionist has power without responsibility. The one last argument that I feel it necessary to refute is that put forward by the CBI in a document which no doubt many hon. Members on both sides have read. It can be summed up as the argument that the closed shop is here, that it is useful, and that what is useful we should accept because it is here; or—in the CBI's own words—
	<br><blockquote><p>"A closed shop is an established feature of the industrial relations' practice in some areas of employment.".</p></blockquote>
I may say in parentheses that it is-odd-that the CBI should say that to members of this Committee when it voted by a majority at its conference last year to get rid of the closed shop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figures for that vote in favour of a member not to belong to a trade union were 387 against 321. The result was almost even-Steven, and under the rules of the CBI the motion was not
	<span class='label label-info column'>710</span>
carried because a substantial majority is needed to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Eighty per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not 80 per cent. It does not go to those ridiculous extremes—the CBI is a sensible organisation and does not deal with absurdities—but, because the majority was so slim, the matter was referred to its steering committee to look at again and to bring forward another report in December.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a secret ballot?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, on a secret ballot. But the idea that the CBI came down with a thunderous majority at its conference is untrue—the result was 387 to 321.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cyril Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may care to comment on simple majorities at a certain Labour Party conference last year, and what those meant to the Labour movement. Apparently those are binding while those of the CBI are not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that assistance, particularly for the assistance with regard to the nature of the majority at the CBI's conference, but it does not alter the comment that I am about to make. Whether the majority was in favour or against, the argument that it is becoming an established feature of industrial relations practice is not one that I regard as acceptable in the first place. So was the slave trade in the nineteenth centruy an accepted practice, but that is no reason why it should have been tolerated. The slave trade was wrong. It exploited human beings who should have been free.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They had no unions. That is why it was tolerated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The more one changes, the more one finds oneself in the same position, might be the answer to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely the same applies to the closed shop situation. The answer to slave labour is not, as the Government have it in the clause, that one should provide for compensatory damages. Nor is the answer—nor can it be—a code of practice, because abolition of the code of practice itself is required. Voluntary association

	<span class='label label-info column'>711</span>
of 50 per cent or 100 per cent of the work force is acceptable, but compulsory association is slavery in the twentieth century.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) have put forward some interesting arguments, and the hon. Gentleman has spoken at length about the rights of the individual. I consider his argument to be perverted, but I respect his right to make it. Nevertheless, will he address himself briefly to one point which always seems to escape people like him? He has extolled the rights of the individual not to belong. Will he now express the rights of trade union members not to work with those who are not members? Does he accept that the majority have some rights, one of which is to be free to exercise their wish not to work with a non-trade unionist?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept entirely that an individual has a right to withdraw his labour for whatever reason he chooses. But I do not think that that undermines my argument. There are rights for majorities and there are rights for minorities, and it will be a sad day for the House of Commons when we do not respect both rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Gentleman would take that point a little further before finishing his speech. What he finally said appears to be a contradiction to his amendment No. 75, which seeks to insert a new subsection (1B) stating:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be unlawful for any person, company or trade union to bring pressure on any employer with a view to influencing that employer to require employees or potential employees to become members of a union."</p></blockquote>
Yet the hon. Gentleman just said that he accepts entirely the right of any individual to withdraw his labour. What happens, therefore, when employees withdraw their labour in an attempt to bring pressure on the employer with a view to influencing that employer to require employees or potential employees to become members of a union? His proposed subsection seeks to make that unlawful. Clearly, it is intended to put pressure on the employer. Yet if the amendment making the closed shop unlawful, were accepted, that would undoubtedly happen. It would certainly
	<span class='label label-info column'>712</span>
not stop my colleagues in the trade union movement withdrawing their labour in an attempt to retain the closed shop that they have enjoyed for many years. Are those people acting unlawfully?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not see why it is fair to expect other people's minority rights to be affected in this way. No doubt the hon. Member for Rochdale has a better reason.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to intervene, partly because I think this is rather empty debate but principally because I thought I could leave it to the hon. and learned Gentleman to correct the mover and supporter—perhaps, later, supporters—of the amendment and teach them the error of their ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am induced to intervene by something said by the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) about the movement of power between employers, workers and trade unions over recent years. That important subject is at the heart of all industrial relations legislation and is a part of the motivation behind the Bill before us. It is a subject on which there is a great deal of misunderstanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I do not agree with the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith), and although I agreed with some but not all of what he said this morning, I recognise that the hon. Gentleman has the best of credentials for putting forward an amendment which—rightly or wrongly—seeks to protect the freedom of individuals because the hon. Gentleman has a commendable record in that regard. When the hon. Member for Hendon, North talks about protecting the rights of individuals, it is a piece of such nauseating hypocrisy that it makes my stomach to round like a windmill. It was he, more than anyone, who defended an employer who sacked his workers for the crime of joining a trade union. For exercising their freedom to join a union, they were sacked, and the hon. Gentleman, if the adjective does not give him the better of the argument, threw his cap in the air with delight. He has no credentials at all to indulge in such a peroration about individual rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's aspersions would carry some weight if his facts were right, but unfortunately for him his facts are incorrect. He is incorrect
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0885">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>713</span>
in asserting—many people have made this assertion, but it is untrue—that anyone was sacked for seeking to join a trade union. The facts are that the people who left Grunwick were not members of a trade union and had not sought to belong to a trade union. Only after they left their place of work and were dismissed did they seek to join a trade union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those facts undermine the whole basis of the hon. Gentleman's argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They do not. We do not want to go over the whole long and sad Grunwick story, which has been retold many times. There is a good book about it which the hon. Gentleman should read, although it does not support what he has just said. The plain fact of the matter is that those workers sought to get away from abject conditions—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Slavery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, modern slavery. That is what he was talking about in such high-faultin' language. They wanted to get away from abject conditions, tried to carry out the functions of a trade union, and were sacked for trying to do so. They did not have any expertise and, when they sought to get some behind them, they were told that it was not on. The plain fact of the matter is that those who wanted to be members of a trade union ate not in the employment of that company and those who did not, are. If that is not interference with individual liberty, I do not know what is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that his case would be more convincing if he stuck to the argument that I have been putting forward rather than trying to cast aspersions on matters in which we do not even agree on the facts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has repeated his curtain lecture, but without adducing any more substance behind him. I am quite content to let the facts about Grunwick speak for themselves, because if the hon. Gentleman thinks that his part in the affair entitles him to go preaching to others about protecting the rights of the individual, he will not carry many people with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will have to bear that scar for the rest of his days—he and
	<span class='label label-info column'>714</span>
his National Association for whatever it is that begins with "F". It is not really "freedom", but it might be something else that begins with "F".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a theme of which we have heard a great deal in recent years from certain quarters, and it was echoed by the hon. Member for Hendon, North. The theme is "True, years ago employers had virtually unlimited autocratic power. True, they did not always exercise it very wisely or very fairly". Though I am bound to say that predecessors of hon. Gentlemen opposite never said that at the time and still defended those autocratic employers, now they say "Let us not go back through history". In history it is true that there was autocratic power and the worker was powerless and his institutions had very little power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now they say "The boot is on the other foot. The employer is powerless, and the worker and his union have all the power. The pendulum has swung too far in the other direction, and all this is due to the closed shop."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the argument, and it brings us to the clause before us today. All anti-closed shop activities are based on the idea that getting rid of the closed shop gets rid of the instrument by which the unions have snatched power out of the hands of the employers and made the pendulum swing too far in the opposite direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That argument is far from reality. First, it is not at all true that the pendulum has swung to the other end of its arc. It varies from industry to industry, but it is even doubtful in some industries whether it has swung back as far as the middle of the arc—whether it has moved half way from total employer power to total union power. There is no industry in which it has swung to the other end of the arc. Were that so, we would have 100 per cent. trade union membership, and we are far from that. If that were so, we would not have so many defeats for trade unions. I am not saying that it should be so, however. I do not want to see absolute power on one side of the table or the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, firstly, it is not true that the union is now all powerful and that the poor little employer has no friends, no power, no instruments, no ammunition and no weaponry. That is a load of nonsense. But there has been a swing, and a very welcome one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0886">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>715</span>
My second point is that in so far as there has been a swing, it is not due to the closed shop or to any of the activities of unions to any great extent. It is due a bit to their activity in recruiting more members and a bit to the improvement in their organisation and staffing, because that has been taking place over the last decade or two. But that is not the big factor which has changed the power relationship between employers and employees. The big factor is something that employers have done and for a very good reason. Technological advance has carried the economic division of labour further and further. In a situation in which the operative process is broken down to a larger and larger number of smaller and smaller operations, any one of which is essential, or any one of most which is essential, to the whole operation, cutting one link of the chain destroys the chain altogether. At that stage, of course, great vulnerability is created on the part of the employer. We have reached the stage when two men sitting at a console can stop a whole power station putting out many megawatts of power, or when 20, 30, 40—perhaps the hon. and learned Gentleman knows the number—data programmers in the Post Office can rob the Post Office temporarily of hundreds of millions of pounds in telephone bills. That is where the vulnerability comes in. The vulnerability of employers does not come from the closed shop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As industries have become more and more capital-intensive so that any plant standing idle is so much more costly per day to the employer than it ever was, the stage is reached at which a handful of people at a key point can stop the whole operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that stage power has moved to the shop floor. It is wrong to argue, as hon. Members do, that power has moved to the head office of the trade unions. It has not. It has moved to the shop floor. Some union officials are becoming very conscious of that, because shop floors—there have been examples of this in recent times—defy their union board room as readily as they defy their employer's boardroom, and there is nothing they can do about it. It is entirely because of the switch of power to the shop floor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that everybody in the trade union movement has realised that. If they had, a whole factory would not be called out on strike. If I wanted to
	<span class='label label-info column'>716</span>
organise an industrial dispute in a car factory, I would not call out 7,000 chaps and make them lose their wages. I would call out a dozen tool grinders and let all the rest go to work. My right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Fletcher) could tell us a great deal more about this matter than any of the rest of us could. If one calls out the tool grinders, all the other chaps can work for a while until all the tools in the machine shops start to get blunted and need regrinding. Gradually, one by one, the machines stop. A day or so after the machine shop is shut down the sub-assembly is shut down, and so on. That is a dozen people in a factory of 7,000. That situation can be duplicated over and again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I have said is by no means irrelevant to what we are discussing. I am trying to get hon. Gentlemen to understand that if they are right in wanting to halt union power, they should not bemuse themselves into thinking that if they wave a magic wand and get rid of the closed shop, they have achieved the operation. They have not achieved the operation unless at the same time as getting rid of the closed shop they also get rid of the electronic controls and all the other sophisticated elements in modern industry which put power on to the shop floor—not, I repeat, into the union boardroom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen may advance different reasons for wanting to get rid of the closed shop, as did the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith). That is fair enough, and we can argue about that. But those who seek to abolish the closed shop in order to put power back, as they think, into the hands of the employers, are chasing a will-o'-the-wisp, and a most illusive will-o'-the-wisp.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not too eager to rise in the first place, but now I am even less eager after the highly persuasive and instructive speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo). But there is one matter which I want to raise, and I think that this clause is the appropriate opportunity. I had intended to raise it later, but if I do so now it may economise on time later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am prompted to intervene because the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) referred to the cases currently before the European Commission on Human Rights. I am as sharply aware of those cases as he is, for reasons which he will understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0887">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>717</span>
I put a parliamentary question recently asking that the United Kingdom submissions should be placed in the Library so that Members of Parliament could see what was being said by the United Kingdom representatives in Strasbourg on our behalf. I was astonished to receive the reply that we could not have those submissions, nor have sight of them, because the Commission's proceedings are in confidence and any submissions are therefore held to be confidential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is outrageous that we in this sovereign Parliament should be told that what our representatives are saying elsewhere is secret and denied to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked that question because I was aware of what the previous Government had submitted in the particular case—submitted, I might say, without guidance from the Department of Employment. That case could be relevant to our discussions. Although I had not been consulted, nor had I, in my role as a former Minister with some responsibility in the matter, sought to influence our submissions, I was anxious to know whether there had been any change in the submissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The submissions were those which had been prepared by the lawyers acting on behalf of the Government and presented on behalf of the Government. I shall not inflict on the Committee the whole of this lengthy document, but I think that the Committee should be aware of some of the arguments put by the United Kingdom Government's lawyers about a particular case at Strasbourg and what they had to say generally about the United Kingdom, the closed shop and the law relating to the closed shop. If I am selective in my quotations, I hope the Committee will realise that I am being selective not in order to bend the argument but merely to economise on time and to avoid having to through the whole document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want, first, to mention the very interesting appendix to the submission. It says, on the subject of employment legislation and the closed shop:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Parliament has over the years (and particularly since 1963) enacted a series of measures designed both to extend the rights of workers and to improve industrial relations in the United Kingdom. These measures have in particular added substantially to the contractual rights which employees had under their contracts of employment. They have inter alia imposed minimum periods of notice, and granted rights to redundancy payments, and remedies for unfair dismissal. The remedies
	<span class='label label-info column'>718</span>
for unfair dismissal, introduced for the first time in the Industrial Relations Act 1971, included the power to recommend reinstatement of a dismissed worker but only if such re-employment would be practicable, and there was no statutory power to compel such reinstatement. That Act expressly recognised the post-entry closed shop subject to various safeguards. The Courts found (see e.g. 	<i>Langston v. A.U.E.W.</i>(1974) I.C.R. 510, 524) that in practice it would not be practicable to reengage a worker in a closed shop where he had been dismissed for refusing to join a union, even though the Act itself gave workers in general the right not to join a union. In short, even under that Act a worker in a closed shop had to choose between joining the union or seeking other employment. The legislation since 1971 has recognised the practical limitations which must be imposed on remedies for dismissal if industrial relations are not to be gravely disrupted by the enforcement of such remedies. Since the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 (as amended), remedies available for unfair dismissal have included a recommendation or order for reinstatement where reinstatement is practicable. If an order for reinstatement is made and not complied with, the Industrial Tribunal 	<i>must</i> make a basic award of compensation payable by the employer to the employee and may in addition make various other awards which can amount in all to £14,700."</p></blockquote>
That has been since increased.
	<br><blockquote><p>"But to make these provisions applicable to a worker in a closed shop dismissed for refusing to join a union would open the gates to applications by individuals who wished to put their employers in the position of having to compensate them for the consequences of their refusal to join a trade union."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah! What was the date of that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This was the submission made by the lawyers. It must have been a couple of years ago. It goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Accordingly, the amended 1974 Act qualified the right to claim the remedies for unfair dismissal where the reason for the dismissal was that the worker refused to join a trade union in spite of a union membership agreement to that effect and notwithstanding the absence of any genuine religious objection on his part to belonging to trade unions.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Limitations on the power of an employer to employ and dismiss particular workers on the one hand and good industrial relations on the other are closely linked. In the United Kingdom all political parties have recognised this. The question has been not whether an employer should be obliged to employ a non union member in a closed shop but what should happen when an employee seeks to insist on remaining a non-union member whilst at the same time remaining an employee in what would otherwise be a closed shop. The existing legislation represents the latest attempt by a democratically elected Parliament to answer this by balancing the competing con-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0888">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>719</span>
siderations in this difficult and delicate area. The legislation retains the right to remedies for unfair dismissal, but qualifies that right to take account of industrial relations realities. Such a qualification is necessary, for without some qualification, the rights arising out of unfair dismissal could not exist, consistently with good industrial relations.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is important to remember too that in this field an individual employer may be placed in an impossible situation if he is obliged by law to employ non-union labour. He may find that by doing so not only is he exposed to industrial action by the other employees of his own business, but also his suppliers and his customers."</p></blockquote>
I turn now to another part of the submission. Counsel set out the functions of the closed shop. He said that they can be summarised as follows—and this is the summary made by the lawyers, not by me—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(i) There is inherent in any capitalist society (and perhaps in any society) an inequality of bargaining power between employer and employee.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(ii) Effective collective bargaining, usually through trade unions, reduces or may even remove this inequality in two ways: by increasing the bargaining strength of the employee and, sometimes, by limiting the employer's opportunity to offer a job to another when the first offence refused to accept its terms.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(iii) In certain circumstances, which cannot objectively be prescribed at least in the United Kingdom, bargaining can only be effective to reduce or remove the inequality of bargaining power if there is a closed shop.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(iv) Therefore it is both socially desirable and necessary if bargaining is always to be as fair as possible that a closed shop should be permitted where through their elected representatives the majority of the employees in a particular work place agree with the employer to introduce and maintain one.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"This argument, the logic of which the United Kingdom Government submits is indefeasible. is dependent upon the premise that in our society there is an inherent inequality of bargaining power."</p></blockquote>
It goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government also respectfully draws the attention of the Commission, with equal emphasis, to the fact that under English law a contracting party has in principle a legal right to be protected from unfairly onerous obligations which are attributable to an inequality of bargaining power."</p></blockquote>
I draw this difficult and complex passage in particular to the attention of the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) and the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst). The hon. and learned Gentleman the Under-Secretary is not here at the moment, but doubtless it will be drawn to his attention when he returns. There has been an assumption
	<span class='label label-info column'>720</span>
running through all our discussions on this matter that, apart from the statutory remedies, an individual in the situation that has been described as the subject of our debates has no redress in the civil courts. That is what this passage goes on to discuss. Referring to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the fact that under English law a contracting party has in principle a legal right to be protected from unfairly onerous obligations which are attributable to an inequality of bargaining power"</p></blockquote>
it goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In its present form the doctrine is of fairly recent origin, to be seen only in 	<i>A. Schroeder Music Publishing Co. Ltd. v. Macaulay (formerly Instone)</i> [1974] 1 WLR, 1308, 	<i>Lloyds Bank Ltd. v. Bundy</i> [1974] 3 WLR, 501, and 	<i>Clifford Davis Management Ltd. v. W.E.A. Records Ltd.</i> [1975] 1 WLR, 61.

God forbid that I should ever have to invoke him in aid—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Lord Denning in the last mentioned case at page 64, where he paraphrases the speech of Lord Diplock in 	<i>Macaulay's</i> case in the following terms:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'Lord Diplock, at pages 1315–1316, urged the Courts to be vigilant. They should look into the provenance of such agreements. He made it clear that if one party uses "his superior bargaining power" so as "to exact" terms that are "unfairly onerous" or "to drive an unconscionable bargain", then the Courts will relieve the other party of his legal duty to fulfil it. He gave this pertinent example: A strong concern prepares a new standard form containing terms which are most unfair—and dictates to the customer, "Take it or leave it." The customer is in a weak position. He has no real option but to accept. The Courts may decline to enforce it or, at any rate, may decline to enforce any term which is unfair to the customer, such as an exemption clause."</p></blockquote>
The submission goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This doctrine could, in principle, be applied to a contract of employment in a free market, where no collective bargaining exists. Suppose, for instance, that an employer in conditions of high unemployment and no social benefits were to offer to a potential employee a job on unfairly onerous terms (£25 per week for 50 hours work per week with 6 months' notice on the employee's side) saying: ' Take it or leave it—if you do not accept it I will soon find some poor beggar who will ', and suppose that the offence accepts it but later wants to give one week's notice to determine the contract: in those (albeit improbable) circumstances there could be little doubt but that a Court would apply the doctrine and relieve the employee of the obligation to give 6 months' notice.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not reading from a judgment. This is the case of Mr. Ronald Roger Webster v. the United Kingdom Government. Mr. Webster was formerly an employee of British Rail, which, if I remember correctly, had a closed shop before the Industrial Relations Act. When the Act was introduced, the closed shop was relaxed and various employees went out of the appropriate union. On the repeal of the Industrial Relations Act, the closed shop was reinstated. This individual and one or two others refused to rejoin and are now taking their case to the European Commission for Human Rights as a preparatory step to going to the European Court.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. James Prior)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We ought to get this straight. It was, of course, prepared by the Attorney-General as the Law Officer of the Crown of the Labour Government. Naturally, he put it all in the context of what his Government believed the law to be, or what they wanted the law to be. He was building the law around section 58 of the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act, and that is what one would have expected him to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>722</span>
To say that this was prepared by independent lawyers is rather like saying that when a lawyer goes to court to defend a defendant he puts an impartial case. He puts the best possible case he can for his own side. There is nothing wrong with that, but to say that it was prepared by independent lawyers is nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be delighted if the right hon. Gentleman would let the Committee see, if there is any revision, what has subsequently been submitted to the Commission. I am giving the Committee the benefit of the gist of what was submitted by the Government of the day in the name of the United Kingdom to the European Commission for Human Rights. Presumably, the Commission is making its decisions on that basis. If there has been any significant shift in the policy expressed here, the Commission will find it most extraordinary that one day the United Kingdom is arguing one case and perhaps the next arguing a different case. If the right hon. Gentleman is suggesting that this was politically slanted, let us look at the political slant that he now has.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman complains that the details have not been put in the Library.

Presumably, Re did not put them there because he did not think it was either right or necessary to do so. He is telling us about these submissions now. If it is right that they should be put in the Library, it was right that they should have been put in the Library when he was in office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difference is this. No one asked when we were in office that they should be put in the Library.

I should not have accepted that.

I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for what he has now said about being prepared to look at the possibility of putting the documents in the Library,

	<br><blockquote><p>"The need for the availability of a closed shop is founded on a premise which is not only economically valid but which potentially imports, or brings into existence, certain fundamental rights on the part of those in or entering into employment. Those rights can be shortly described as the right to a fair bargain."</p></blockquote>
The conclusions are as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every potential employee has a right to a fair contract of employment, made in circumstances in which his inherent inferiority of bargaining power is reduced as much as possible. In order to realise that right, he has an inherent right to participate in or to be protected by collective bargaining, a right which is indirectly protected by the Convention.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"That right, to collective bargaining, would be valueless unless it were a right to effective collective bargaining.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"In some circumstances, which it is difficult or even impossible to prescribe, at least in the United Kingdom, collective bargaining can only be effective if there is a closed shop.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Therefore the potential workforce as a whole has an inherent right to the availability of a closed shop.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"No doubt, it is for these reasons that millions of people in the United Kingdom work in closed shops, and that millions in the United Kingdom (about 8 million in 1964) favour them."</p></blockquote>

It will relieve you to know, Mr. Goodhew, that I do not intend to quote
	<span class='label label-info column'>724</span>
further from the document although there are many other passages that would be of enormous interest to the Committee. I could easily have paraphrased those passages and put them into what I might have pretended to be and presented as a speech of my own, but I thought it right that the Committee should know that those were not my views. In some degree, I think perhaps they are a little stronger than the views that I should express, but they are the views submitted on behalf of the United Kingdom Government in, presumably, a submission that was carefully crawled over by the Law Officers at the time. If the right hon. Gentleman seeks to attribute that submission to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin), it reflects an eloquence and understanding of these matters which is a tribute to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intended to seek your guidance, Mr. Goodhew, about the possibility of perhaps the House—Back-Bench Members of Parliament do not have any resources of their own—having this document copied so that it could be available to every member of the Committee. If the right hon. Gentleman will do what he has half-promised to do—I very much hope that he will present us with the up-to-date submission so that we can see whether there had been any changes of substance and significance—that will be much appreciated by the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I ought to put it a little stronger than that. The hon. Member for Hendon, North has reminded the Committee that there may be, dependent upon the decision of the Commission and the subsequent judicial proceedings, a necessity to look yet again at the state of statute law in the United Kingdom. The Committee would need to know what the United Kingdom Government are arguing at Strasbourg so that it can make a clearer and fairer judgment about the issues which are not only before us at the moment but which will be coming before us in the next few weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will give the Committee a firm assurance that will seek to bring forward the up-to-date copy of that document for the purposes I have mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Wolfson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take this opportunity to make a brief contribution
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0891">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>725</span>
on this subject. I appreciate that, when I say "brief", it may be taken as brief in comparison with some of the speeches made in the Committee, but I hope that mine will be brief by any standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speak from an understanding of and a feeling for the importance and significance of the contribution that trade unions have made to social progress in this country over the past 100 years. There is no doubt in my mind that that is true and that the trade unions have made a major contribution to that progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate, too, the importance of the closed shop to the individual men and women who are members of trade unions in many cases, and why they regard the closed shop as an important part of their structure and ability to bring pressure to bear on employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I look at this question now from a different viewpoint—not the viewpoint of management and not the viewpoint of the trade union but the viewpoint of a Member of Parliament elected to give due significance and importance to the interests of individuals. I am increasingly worried that the closed shop provides opportunity for abuse and provides a weapon of fear and concern to individuals who do not go along with its necessity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that it is becoming increasingly unacceptable that trade unions in their current position in Britain should have to use what can only be described in some circumstances as pressgang methods to achieve recruitment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening to the hon. Gentleman with great interest. He is very worried, obviously, about these closed shops and about the rights of the individual, as are we all. He talks of abuse. Instead of generalising, will he give us some examples of closed shops where these abuses have taken place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wolfson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had discussion of this previously in the Committee. I am delighted to be able to bear down on two instances that have been brought to my notice since I was elected to Parliament. One was not a constituent of mine but was the wife of one of those who suffered under the Transport
	<span class='label label-info column'>726</span>
Salaried Staffs Association closed shop agreements. The husband lost his job and has not been able to achieve employment since. His wife wrote to me explaining the circumstances and the situation which had arisen as a result of those individuals not being prepared to submit to union membership, having worked for many years in that industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other example is of a constituent of mine who was dismissed from his job as a result of being unprepared to join not a trade union, because he had been a trade union member for many years, but the particular union which that company had agreed under a closed shop agreement to recognise as the union to which all its employees must now belong. This individual had a conflict of loyalty, not about joining a union but about joining a particular union. His views were such that he was prepared to give up his job as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In both those cases—on whatever side of the Committee we sit—we should be concerned and bothered by that kind of abuse. I also feel that it would be helpful to the present unhappy image of trade unions in Britain if they did not require closed shop agreements to exist in the way that they do now. People would be far more prepared to accept and realise the undoubted contribution that trade unions can and do make in so many cases to good industrial relations and to effective production, productivity and results in many companies. But all the time in the current situation we come up against people's concern that there is power there which overrides the individual and power which is somehow alien to the origins of the trade unions and the Labour movement. That is in sharp contrast to what both those movements set out to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now we have the example in the headlines today and last night of the expulsion of 600 members of the ISTC at Sheerness. It is the union's right to do that. But, in a closed shop, should those people wish to move and work elsewhere, they would be denied the right to work. Yet they are people who had no quarrel with their own employer and who have taken the view that their jobs, the support of their families, the success of that business and its ability to go on paying them their wages, were more important than obeying the instruction of their union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0892">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>727</span>
I accept of course that it is a matter of political judgment whether it is right, within the Bill, in the national interest to go for abolition of the closed shop in the way that the amendment requests. I want to make it clear that I abhor the necessity for unions to require a closed shop. I await with interest to hear what my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Employment has to say about how he proposes, in summarising the Bill, to deal with the concerns that I have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cyril Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the interchange took place asking for examples, I sorted through my papers. I think it would help the hon. Member if I read a letter that I received in a lady's own handwriting, so there is nothing sponsored about it. Her address is 33a Ormond Road, Hythe, Kent. She says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I would like to bring to your attention the tremendous hardship my husband and I have suffered since 25 September 1976. For over 24 years my husband was employed by British Transport Hotels Limited in the wages department and he held the highest post open to him outside the management staff. Throughout his service he asked frequently both verbally and in writing for the full subscriptions to the TSSA to be deducted from his salary as he had no desire to be a free rider. However, this was refused by the TSSA unless he signed an undertaking that he would use every endeavour to promote the objects and interests of the association. He had to refuse as that would have been untrue. When the management entered into a closed shop agreement with the unions in 1976 he explained the situation once more to the head of personnel and asked for help and advice in solving the problem. None was offered and he was told to sign or go. He was dismissed in September of that year and the only reason for his dismissal was his honesty in refusing to sign the union agreement. At the time of my husband's dismissal we had a flat in Black-heath. We had to give this up and for the past three years, four months and four days we have moved around from one lot of furnished accommodation to another. Furnished accommodation is insecure. We have sold our furniture and personal possessions over these past three years to assist the situation in which we find ourselves. My husband is unable to get a job. We thought we lived in a democracy, but the belief is sadly wrong. There is no justice. My husband thought in 1939 to 1945 that he was fighting for just that."</p></blockquote>
The letter goes on. That is the misery caused to a family by a closed shop where the man was willing to have his union dues not paid to the union but taken from his salary but could not sign a form saying that he would uphold the
	<span class='label label-info column'>728</span>
objects of the union. That is the consequence to him and his family.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wolfson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) for giving us that detailed example of exactly the problem to which I wish to draw the Committee's attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was impressed by the patent sincerity of the speech we have just heard from the hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Wolfson). Nevertheless I feel that his genuinely expressed concern is unnecessary. I accept that hard cases may be quoted. Indeed, that quoted by the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) is a hard case. But I do not understand why anyone can be quite so obstinate as to put himself out of work—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—as to put himself out of work for four years and to sell up his home rather than accept membership of a trade union which is there to protect his interests in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A scrounger?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It certainly leads to certain suspicions. It may be that the Secretary of State for Social Services ought to send some of his inspectors round to see how this man has been living all this time while he ought to have been working.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wolfson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked how anybody could be so obstinate, but the point was that that man was not prepared to join that particular association because he would have had to accept all its aims and objects. The aims and objects of many trade unions are not concerned merely with the welfare of the individual at work; they are very much wider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And do his best to further them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may well be. I do not know to what objects of the TSSA that individual objected. The hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0893">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>729</span>
Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) did not tell us which particular aims were the cause of the abjection. Who knows what they were? Nevertheless, I will accept that there are difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend also contemplate the fact that my constituent to whom I referred this morning, who had been dismissed for his trade union activities, may well be out of work for a long time, particularly if he has the same experience that I had when I was sacked for trade union activities and was blacklisted. Conservative Members have not shown a crumb of sympathy for such people. If my constituent is unemployed in four years' time, I am pretty sure that Conservative right hon. and hon. Members will brand him a scrounger.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely right. I was about to come to that point. There are undoubtedly many more people in this country who have been put out of work for being trade unionists than have ever been put out of work for not being trade unionists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the printers in Dundee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. There is no question about that. While I accept the sincerity of the concern expressed by the hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Wolfson), I think he might also direct his concern sometimes to those who have been victimised for being trade unionists, especially those who were victimised by the company associated with his hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst), whose speech, frankly, was really weird.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman painted a fanciful picture of millions of trade unionists being oppressed by what he called "the union"—of people bound and shackled and subjected to tyranny by the union. But the union consists of its members; they are the union. How can they be oppressed by the union when there is no union without them? The hon. Gentleman expressed grave worry about the power of trade union officials. The trade union officials have precisely as much power as the members give them, and no more. If the members
	<span class='label label-info column'>730</span>
feel that they are abusing their power, they take that power away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cyril Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am willing to be corrected, but I understand that the general secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union, Mr. Moss Evans, is appointed for life. If the members of T&GWU, for example, object to the way in which the general secretary is using his powers, can they—in the hon. Gentleman's phrase—get rid of him, or do something about it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a lay executive of the Transport and General Workers Union, as there is of nearly all trade unions. Certainly that is within the power of the members of any trade union. Every union has a rule which allows machinery to be operated to get rid of a full-time official, right up to the top and including the general secretary, if he does not do his job to the satisfaction of the members. There is no doubt that in any trade union there is power to remove a trade union official who is abusing his power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hendon, North told us that 30 to 40 per cent. of trade unionists were being forced to belong to closed shops. The closed shops are only there because that 30 to 40 per cent.—if the hon. Gentleman's figure is right—have demanded them. Nobody sits on the top of Mount Olympus and determines where there shall be closed shops. They happen because people on the ground—on the shop floor, in the office or in the factory—demand that there shall be a closed shop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman telling the Committee that, whatever the percentage may be, all those people have voted for a closed shop? My understanding is that very often closed shops have been negotiated without a vote being taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying not that they have all voted for them but that the vast majority of them have. Most closed shops have been brought about as the result not necessarily of the postal ballot to which the Government are addicted but certainly of a genuine democratic vote in a meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be glad to know whether the hon. Gentleman
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0894">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>731</span>
would agree that it ought to be the principle of any closed shop that it should be sustained only by a democratic vote and that from time to time the views of members should be tested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no doubt at all that, in any factory where a closed shop exists, if the majority of the members there did not want a closed shop it would disappear overnight. It is as simple as that. Conservative Members do not understand how trade unionism operates. It exists only because of trade unionists. It does not exist in an objective sort of way. Trade unionism is there because trade unionists are there. Closed shops are there because the trade unionists want them. If the trade unionists decide that they do not want the closed shop, it will disappear from the scene very quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Needham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree that that is not true in the case of pre-entry closed shops. In the printing industry, for example—as the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) knows perfectly well—it would be quite unthinkable for even those who wanted to get out of the union to do so. Were they to do so they would have no chance on the card system of getting another job. The hon. Gentleman's claim does not apply to those in pre-entry closed shops—perhaps a million people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) will deal with this point. He is a member of a printing trade union. I shall simply say in passing that I believe that the great majority of pre-entry closed shops have been brought into existence primarily to guard craft standards—to preserve the traditional standards which have been maintained for centuries within a particular craft. But that point is not relevant to this amendment. Although there is no reference to the closed shop, the aim of this amendment is to outlaw a type of agreement which provides for 100 per cent. union membership. That is nothing to do with pre-entry closed shops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hendon, North referred to the "questionable benefits" of trade union membership, and sug
	<span class='label label-info column'>732</span>
gested that people did not really want to take advantage of those benefits, because they were not worth having. I wonder whether he can tell me how many people refuse to accept the wage increase which the trade union negotiates for them. I have never come across any people who have refused such a wage increase. How many people insist on going into work during the works holidays negotiated by the trade union? I do not see people queuing up at the factory gates during holiday weeks demanding to be allowed to work for nothing because they object to the trade union which has negotiated their holidays for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The benefits are very far from questionable. They are very solid, indeed. Most people—even if they do not like the trade union, and even if they are not members of it—manage to benefit from the results of union negotiation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wolfson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give due deference to greater experience. I accept fully the benefits the hon. Gentleman has just described. Of course, they are real benefits, and of course, everybody accepts them. Those who are not in a union can indeed benefit from the level of wages established by the unions. However, the doubtful benefit, in the present state of the economy, is that the unions are holding back the opportunities that could exist for greater effectiveness in industrial production and marketability. That is where the operations of the unions come into doubt. How much further forward could we be if it had not been for some of the disruptive activities of trade unions in this country in the past 10 years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a totally different issue and bears no relation to the amendment. I should be happy to pursue that point, because, far from damaging the economy, the existence of trade unions and sensible agreements between unions and employers have greatly benefited industrial advance in this country, especially technological advance. There is no possible doubt about that. But elaborating on that would not be keeping to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was unable to obtain a reply from the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) to my question about the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0895">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>733</span>
contradiction between his amendment and what he actually said. It is important that he or the hon. Member for Rochdale answers my question. As one of them has already declined to do so, perhaps the hon. Member for Rochdale will deal with it. Do they intend to put people in a position of acting unlawfully if they withdraw their labour in support of a closed shop? That needs to be clarified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is clear enough. It would make that provision. But the hon. Member for Hendon, North said that he did not seek to do that. He defended the right of every trade unionist to withdraw his labour for whatever reason. Does the hon. Member for Rochdale take the same view? If so, he had better withdraw his amendment. It clearly makes it unlawful for trade unionists to withdraw their labour in order to put pressure on their employers—which is the only purpose of withdrawing labour at any time—with a view to influencing them to require potential employees to become members of a union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that that would happen many times all over the country. Those who have gained the advantage of a closed shop will not give it up lightly, whatever the House may say. That is the practical reality of industrial life. They will down tools to defend their position, their bargaining rights and the benefits that they have gained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee needs to know whether the hon. Member for Rochdale wants to see trade unionists being hauled off to court because they have withdrawn their labour in those circumstances. No penalty is provided for in the amendment or in the proposed now subsection, so presumably we are talking only about a civil action for tort. Will the prospective employee take the union members to court? Who will be the injured party—the person applying for the job who is refused because he will not join the union? Will he obtain an injunction against the striking employees? If they then decline to obey the injunction, they will be hauled off to prison for contempt of court. Once again we shall be back in the position that the Government have been trying to get out of and which they created in their original Industrial Relations Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>734</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is on that mythical roundabout mentioned earlier by my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary. If the hon. Gentleman reads the amendment, he will see that any contract that requires
	<br><blockquote><p>"a person to belong to a trade union is declared void."</p></blockquote>
In other words, it will not be valid in law. He is making very heavy weather of the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot escape from the consequences of the proposed subsection (1B) by quoting proposed subsection (1C). I am referring to subsection (1B).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cyril Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole of the hon. Gentleman's argument is based on one assumption. It is that if Members of Parliament, democratically elected, pass a law, the trade union movement has a right to say "We will not obey that law". The whole of his argument is based on the assumption that they will refuse to obey the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not talking about whether they have a right to refuse to obey the law. I am saying that they would refuse to obey the law in a case such as this, where the law is manifestly unjust and seeks to take away rights that trade unionists have won over many years of hard struggle. That is the reality of life in the trade union movement. It is time that some hon. Gentlemen understood it. The hon. Member for Rochdale knows as well as I that if this provision became law, that law would, in certain places, be broken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been assured throughout the proceedings—I hope that we shall be reassured—that the Government's main desire is to create a consensus. They have not succeeded so far. I am looking forward to hearing their view of the amendment, which I am sure that they cannot accept. There is no doubt that we shall be opening the gates once again to the kind of conflict that resulted in the famous Pentonville Five whom the Official Solicitor had to get out of prison. That sort of thing would occur again if the amendment were passed. It does not do for an hon. Gentleman who claims to be a Liberal to say that he would be prepared to see the kind of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0896">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>735</span>
harsh law enacted that would virtually compel people to break it in order to defend their rights, liberties and the benefits that they had gained from hard struggles in the trade union world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cyril Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no question of the provisions of the amendment interfering with the liberty of a man to join a union. The existing law interferes with a man's liberty to refuse to join a union. Therefore, I fail to understand the logic of the hon. Gentleman's argument that the amendment would in some way interfere with the rights or liberties of trade unionists. It does not seek to do that, but it would defend the rights of those who did not wish to be trade unionists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would defend the minority at the expense of the rights and liberties of the majority who have worked and fought for a closed shop to defend their own interests. The amendment would take away those rights to defend their interests, which are presently protected by a union membership agreement. That is what I say that the unions will not accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like other members of the Committee—probably all other members—I agree with the basic right of a person to withhold his or her labour. But there is an even more basic right in a free society—the right to work where a job exists. I am the first to agree that in the past, trade unions have been of great value, and still are, in improving the share of wealth and the working conditions of wage earners in this country. But one must accept that the present situation is not leading in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
General work and wage conditions in this country are appalling when measured on an international scale. We have virtually the poorest work force in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that trade unions in the past have done a good job. I think that they can and should stand on their past record, and allow it to recruit membership. Members of a free society should be free to join and free to leave a trade union, as they wish. At no time should a member of our community be legally subject to threat—the fear of losing his living or the fundamental right to work
	<span class='label label-info column'>736</span>
by the threat of withdrawal of union membership in a closed shop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right to work as a free citizen is basic to a free society. It is the clear duty of the Government and the House to protect men and women from the fear of losing that basic right. Furthermore, I believe that many people who voted so convincingly at the last election are looking to us for action to protect the basic principles of the right to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore fully support the ideals behind the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will you vote for it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me finish. However, I believe that we must look at our industrial relations as a dynamic area of activity—an area which we as a nation have got sadly wrong. As I said before, we now have some of the lowest productivity in the industrialised world—just the industrialised world—not to mention the technological world of Japan, Germany, the United States and Switzerland. We also, of course, have one of the poorest paid work forces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, what overrides my strong personal feelings on the details of the clause is our main aim, the aim of restoring sanity to our industrial relations, that sanity which alone can restore long-term profitability, long-term job security, and a long-term improvement in the standard of living for us all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that, to restore that sanity, instead of with coercion, a Bill must be enacted that is generally acceptable to trade union leaders, their members, to men and women who are working but who are not members of trades unions, to employers and to the Government in their role of maintaining law and order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Bill is generally fair, constructive and acceptable. If I am correct and the Bill proves to be acceptable, and therefore effective as an Act, we shall have achieved a major, enlightened and practical step forward in our industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in that hope that I shall maintain my support for the Government, despite my personal feelings on the details of this clause and my sympathy with the amendment—an amendment that I feel, if it is pushed and becomes part of the Act, may ruin the acceptability of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0897">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>737</span>
Act. That is the crucial criterion. I. urge my lion. Friend the Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) and the hon. Member for Rochdale to bear that in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I intervene at this stage to give the Government's view on these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1974, 1975 and 1976 we had long and passionate debates on the whole question of the closed shop. Since then this matter has continued to dominate a great deal of the debate in Parliament on industrial relations—as it did during the passage of the 1971 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the greatest speeches made in the House since the war was the one by Mr. Brian Walden in Committee cm that Bill on the Floor of the House. I have had cause since then to ask him whether he still holds to the views that he expressed at that time. He was seeking to explain to the Conservative Government that on the matter of the closed shop he felt that we were failing to understand the enormous emotions which working alongside someone who was not a member of (the union could create.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have met that attitude on a number of occasions—as, I suspect, have nearly all hon. Members on the Committee—when a group of miners, for example, say that they will not go down the cage with someone who is not a member of the union. I recognise that it calls forth enormous emotions on both sides. I suspect that it is right that it should, except that it is absolutely wrong that it should do so in terms of industrial relations. What one needs to do in industrial relations is to keep down the temperature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have taken part in debates on these matters when I have felt passionately that the imposition of the closed shop as it has been interpreted—for example, in the British Rail case of 1976—was absolutely intolerable and was a disgrace to a civilised society. I have never believed that it was necessary for trade unions to exact the price of the last member—or the job of the last employee—to carry out their duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Strangely, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) pointed out, there were about 3 million members of trade unions in closed shops until the early or mid-1950s. There has
	<span class='label label-info column'>738</span>
been a dramatic growth in the last few years. In part, that was due, first, to the 1971 Act effectively banning the closed shop. Second, the abolition of the 1971 Act as a result of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 pushed a lot more people into the closed shop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I approach this matter as a person who, by instinct and upbringing—I have to accept that—is much against the closed shop. I should never wish to be a party to a closed shop agreement because I think that there ought to be better ways for trade unions to attract their members. I believe that there always ought to be some exemptions made for those who have deeply held personal convictions against joining a union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the approach that we have sought to adopt. It is a different approach from that of 1970–71, partly because it did not work. Whatever our views may have been at that time, the fact of the matter is that it did not work. I have asked countless employers what they did about the closed shop following the passage of the 1971 Act. They look at one rather sheepishly and say "We never actually got round to getting rid of it".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is another reason why I want to be careful this time that what we do we can actually enforce. I think that that is really the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Winchester (Mr. Browne). I suspect that it is a point that most of my hon. Friends would make. We need at least to see that there is proper provision for the individual who has good grounds for not joining. At one time we thought in terms of "reasonable" grounds. I think that that was the wording we used on the 1974 Act in the famous Lever amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Madel) will remember it well. Those were the sort of grounds that we felt we should seek to protect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always believed that we should seek to underwrite union membership agreements within the law in such a way that it would lead to the acceptance of voluntary union membership agreements which included the conditions that we regard as being the very least that are necessary to protect individual rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always looked upon the clause as not being so much a penalty clause and a clause stipulating what has to be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0898">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>739</span>
done by law, as a voluntary clause which enables good voluntary practice to work. In other words, only if one does not obey good voluntary practice does one begin to run foul of the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why the existing work force, the conscience clause and the ballot were all matters that we felt were reasonable and right. If a union membership agreement contained those, there was no question of dismissal and, therefore, no question of compensation having to be paid. It was only if a union membership agreement did not contain those terms, or had not had a ballot beforehand, that compensation would, of course, be paid out for unfair dismissal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was fortified in that by a number of other factors, and by what appeared in "In Place of Strife". Unfortunately, I cannot put my hand on the relevant passage at the moment. Instead, let me go through the TUC guidance on the operation of the closed shop, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it should be recognised that for many years, unions voluntarily and without any legal requirement, have made provision for conscientious objectors to be excluded from the closed shop provision, but in some cases on the understanding that they make an equivalent payment to charity. Some union membership agreements also provide that certain categories of workers need not join the union or unions signified in the agreement …The closed shop need not be a rigid arrangement. Its scope can be as flexible as the parties concerned wish it to be and unions might bear this firmly in mind".</p></blockquote>
That is what the clause seeks to do. It will protect the rights of individuals in those sorts of circumstances laid down in the clause. I am certain that that is the best possible voluntary approach, because then these agreements can be drawn up where it suits both employer and trade union, and there can be very little argument about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I could, first, return to the right hon. Gentleman's point about the expansion of closed shop agreements, would the Secretary of State agree that as the University of Warwick survey showed, much of that was employer-inspired and not so much due to the changes in the Act?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, his Department's survey of closed shop agreements shows a marked I
	<span class='label label-info column'>740</span>
expansion of written agreements and of all sorts of exemptions, so, in fact, the voluntary system is working. It is no good the Secretary of State calling this a voluntary system. The clauses arc not voluntary. They are substituting a new system of law for a voluntary system which was increasingly showing itself able to work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difficulty about last point raised by the hon. Gentleman is that there have been a number of glaring instances where the voluntary system has not worked. I believe that once this provision is enacted, we will see those glaring cases removed, because the voluntary system will look after it. But I think that it needs the underpinning effect of the law for that to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know of a number of examples where people have been grossly unfairly treated. The hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) mentioned one, but there are countless others. We also know of quite a large number of people who feel very strongly about the issue but who, in order to preserve their jobs, have forgotten their conscience and joined the union rather than lose their jobs. We want to be careful about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister addressing himself to the amendments or to the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I was addressing myself to the amendment. On the question again, of the conscience proposals, Donovan said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is the responsibility of the employer in concluding a closed shop agreement to bear in mind the interests of existing employees who are not in the union and ensure that they are adequately safeguarded."</p></blockquote>
"In Place of Strife" went even further. The 1969 White Paper said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Before agreeing to a closed shop, employers should seek to obtain suitable protection for people who refused to join trade unions on conscience grounds".</p></blockquote>
In saying that I do not think we want to go as far as the amendments, we are seeking to do what is practical and reasonable, and to accept in spirit the sort of difficulties that the hon. Member for Rochdale, and my hon. Friends the Members for Hendon, North, Sevenoaks (Mr. Wolfson), Winchester, and all my
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0899">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>741</span>
other hon. Friends, feel about this important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Radice) says that the experience of the research carried out by Warwick university is that employers have wanted and have been, as it were, the front runners in union membership agreements. I think that, up to a point, that has been true in the Engineering Employers' Federation, but I do not believe it has been true in many other industries. There are a good many employers who bitterly regret that they allowed themselves to be talked into union membership agreements as easily as they were. I do not believe that they have led to industrial peace in the way that they thought they would.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has fairly set out his position and that of the Government. He is seeking ground that is practical and reasonable, and he believes that the line should, therefore, be drawn at matters of conviction and conscience. But can he explain and justify why it is neither practical nor reasonable or, if it is practical, why it is not reasonable for people who do not wish to belong to a trade union in a closed shop not to do so on grounds of just preferring not to or being disenchanted with the way that the union is running and giving instructions to him or being in mere disagreement with it? What is impracticable and unreasonable about those circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the case of the existing work force, when a union membership agreement comes in, I am certain that the members of the existing work force should not have to join. I see no reason why they should be pushed into joining a union, as my hon. Friend says, for whatever reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When it is in existence, it is much harder for that person to argue that, having been a member of the union, he should withdraw from it. That is why we have drawn the conscience clause as we have, and I think to draw it wider would land one straight away in the sort of industrial problems which my hon. Friend the Member for Winchester recognises and deplores, although he thinks that to go further at this stage would lead to industrial anarchy, would
	<span class='label label-info column'>742</span>
not work, and would not achieve his objective. I may return to my hon. Friend's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CBI, in a letter to us in January commenting on the Bill, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The CBI recognise that the closed shop is an established feature of industrial relations practice in some areas of employment. We do not therefore feel that the time has yet come to make union membership agreements unenforceable. None the less, we are most concerned that the law should provide comprehensive safeguards to protect the rights of the individual."</p></blockquote>
Quite fairly, that is what we are seeking to do. I beg all members of the Committee to see this legislation, as the Government do, as giving the necessary degree of protection to the individual. This is the approach that we promised the electorate and the approach on which we consulted last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have listened to an enormous number of people in drawing up our proposals. Experience has shown that if we do not frame the law in a way which will accommodate the principle of the closed shop, where it is the overwhelming wish of employees and management to have one, it will simply be ineffective. To outlaw the closed shop in the way suggested by the amendments would drive many of these agreements underground again and would not achieve the objective which the hon. Member for Rochdale seeks to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the hon. Gentleman's point of view, but I am a little disappointed, because he has changed his mind a bit since 1974. I looked up his speeches at that time, because I am concerned to carry the hon. Gentleman wherever I can—metaphorically not literally. At that time he was saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In other words, I am prepared to accept the principle of the closed shop and of the pre-entry closed shop. Therefore, I shall vote against the amendment which voids them and which seems to contribute nothing to the discussion."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 21 May 1974; c. 125.]</p></blockquote>
Then, in December 1974, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The position is quite simple. Although we are opposed to closed shops in principle, we realise that where they exist, one has to accept them."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 3 December 1974; Vol. 882, c. 1412.]</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cyril Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must confess that the Minister has done what I have not done and looked up what I said in 1974. Nothing that he has just quoted alters my point of view, but perhaps I would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0900">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>743</span>
be prepared to alter it, and indeed go back to my 1974 position, if he can give the Committee an assurance that the trade union movement is prepared to accept in the spirit in which he is now speaking the sort of amendments to the Act that the Government are proposing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been reading in the press about great demonstrations and marches in May or some time this year. Trade unions over the country have been asked to come and demonstrate in London against the Bill. If we could have an indication that the reasonableness of his approach was accepted and understood by the trade union movement and that therefore in the interests of good industrial relations it would accept the amendments to the Act that the Bill proposed, I might say, in the interests of good industrial relations, so be it. But can he give us such an assurance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that I could give those assurances. It would be of enormous benefit to industrial relations generally if I could, because it is a reasonable position to have reached. I hope that, as time goes on, provided we seek to get a reasonable balance, although I could not for one moment expect the TUC to say so, it will perhaps acquiesce in what we seek to do because it understands that it is reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I went as far as the hon. Gentleman seeks to go in his amendment, I am certain that we should be set once more not just on a course of collision, because that is a matter of judgment, but on a course which would drive the closed shop underground again, and would certainly not achieve for many individuals the sort of freedoms which Government supporters and the hon. Member for Rochdale wish to support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the last two or three minutes the right hon. Gentleman has twice talked of the closed shop being "driven underground". Would the right hon. Gentleman withdraw that phrase? Will he accept and acknowledge that after the passing of the 1971 Act in which the principle was enshrined, trade unionists and employers up and down the country decided that under no circumstances would they accept the outlawing of the closed shop, and they
	<span class='label label-info column'>744</span>
carried an with no recourse to the 1971 Act? They were not driven underground. They carried on exactly as if nothing had happened, notwithstanding the 1971 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an even more serious situation, because they were defying the law. The House should not put itself in the position where it makes laws which are defied. Both employers and trade unions defied the law, That is absolutely wrong. Certainly no one in the Committee should wish to pass legislation which could lead to that happening again. So that is why I am so determined—in what I am told is an obstinate manner on occasions—to try to get the legislation as nearly right as we can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not pretend that the legislation will solve all our industrial relations problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or any of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we are to get that sort of spirit in the country, we probably shall not solve any of them. That is not an attitude that I am prepared to live with, because I believe that the vast majority of people in Britain want the sort of legislation that we seek to introduce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to some of the special points raised. I was asked whether I would place in the Library copies of the Government's submission to the Commission for the hearing that took place on 9 July. I am informed that we are following the rules of procedure laid down by the Commission, and that it would be wrong for us to act in a way which the Commission, under the rules of the convention, clearly believes would not be in the best interests of the effective working of the convention and, therefore, that we should not do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the communiqué issued after the Commission meeting on 9 July 1979 made absolutely clear what the general nature of the Government's submissions were, and we have made no secret of it since. Not only that, but we made it clear that we believed that the submissions made by the Solicitor-General on our behalf in a half-day hearing at Strasbourg on that date set out quite clearly that the changes that we were proposing in the legislation covered the case of Mr. Webster and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0901">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>745</span>
his two colleagues, and that had that legislation been in operation at the time, there would have been no case for Mr. Webster and his two colleagues to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North mentioned European Commission case No. 4072/69. The answer is that the case is known to the Government and, more importantly, to the Commission itself. It was not a closed shop case. The Commission decided that it was manifestly ill-founded and declared it inadmissible. It concerned a Belgian steel worker who had made a number of complaints about the way he was selected for redundancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission had been handling the British Rail case arising from the previous Administration's legislation, and in the course of doing so reviewed its own relevant cases. But it has itself stressed that it was the first time that it had been called upon to deal with the closed shop issue in an application, and in declaring the BR case to be admissible it said—perhaps I should get this on the record, although I apologise for having to read it out—
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the Commission's opinion it is now sufficiently clear that the interpretation of Article 11 of the Convention, in particular whether it protects also the right not to join a trade union, appears to be the main issue … This issue has been raised in earlier cases which did not, however, on the facts presented in those cases, call for a decision by the Commission on that point … In the present case the issue is clearly before the Commission and both parties have advanced various arguments for and against such an interpretation."</p></blockquote>
As I understand it, the position is that we are still waiting for the Commission to let us have its report. It can then go to the Ministers and they can then decide whether it should go on to the Court. If that is decided, we shall have a chance at that stage of appearing before the Court again. My hon. and learned Friend will clear up any further points on that if he is required to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My firm view—it is also the view that the Solicitor-General took—is that all the points raised by Mr. Webster would have been covered by our legislation, and he made that point strongly on 9 July. More than one issue will be dealt with in that report, and it would be idle for me to comment on the Government's response to it before it is received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend will know that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>746</span>
other issues involved were whether the Government could be responsible for the activities of British Rail, and also whether we could be responsible for Hull corporation in another case which was before the Court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had to fight the issue through in Conservative Party conferences and on many other occasions. We are following exactly what we put in our election manifesto. It does not go as far as some would wish. I believe that it is a practical solution to the issue of principle for the individual. If we can protect the rights of individuals sensibly in this way, and if we can discuss on other amendments, too, what we mean and seek to do about deeply held personal convictions and conscience, and also what we intend to do about the code of practice, it should help my hon. Friends considerably in making up their minds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the manner in which the hon. Member for Rochdale presented his amendments, as I do the way in which my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North presented his. I acknowledge the hon. Gentleman's passionate belief in these matters. I have a great deal of sympathy with the way in which he put his case. I believe that we are doing what is right in industrial relations terms. I hope, therefore, that when the time comes the hon. Gentleman will feel that, in view of the assurance from the Government, he can withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric G. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) and the hon.

On frequent occasions I have to defend the Secretary of State in this Committee. I have had to do it against the unfair attacks of Lord George Brown. In the right hon. Gentleman's absence at a Cabinet meeting a few weeks ago, I had to do it when he was fighting the battles against the hawks in the Cabinet. On this occasion, probably the only occasion during the Committee proceedings, the Opposition will be voting with the Government against some of the more extreme ideas that have been put forward during this debate
I do not want to take up much time

of the Committee, because we want to reach a conclusion on this group of amendments, although one or two of my hon. Friends still wish to make brief contributions. I do not want to stray too far because you, in your wisdom, Mr. Goodhew, have selected another six groups of amendments, and some of the points I hoped to make in this debate I may be able to make on those when we return to this subject on Thursday morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the hon. Members for Hendon, North and Rochdale have failed to understand is the basis of trade union organisation. The hon. Member for Rochdale said he had been a member of a trade union and understood its workings, practice and so on. But the suggestion of the hon. Member for Hendon, North that the position of individual workers is in some ways now much more strong than it was a few years ago is wholly fallacious. In fact, the position of trade unions, in relation to employers, is still extremely weak. One will always find employers devising methods and schemes to outwit and do down the trade unions. We see it happening all the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen the growth of the multinationals. Even the relatively simple act a few weeks ago—which will have a devastating impact on the British economy—when the Chancellor of the Exchequer was able to lift all exchange controls will affect the relationship of trade unions to their employers. There will be that section able to transfer capital abroad for projects. Jobs will go overseas rather than be developed here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Confederation of British Industry has decided that it will organise anti-strike funds, so employers all the time will seek to adjust so that they maintain the power that they have. The motive force behind trade unions is always 100 per cent. membership. Who can blame them for that, given all the factors? Trade unions will always seek, as far as is practicable, to achieve those organisational objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) said in a very good contribution that historically the closed shop was one way of defending the hard-won rights of the trade unions. I would be much more convinced by the hon. Members for Hendon, North and Rochdale if they were to say a bit more
	<span class='label label-info column'>748</span>
about the free rider argument. It was mentioned by the hon. Member for Rochdale. But all of us who have had practical experience, either as officials or officers of trade unions, always know those who are not too keen on belonging to the trade union. In most cases, it is not really on grounds of religious belief, as was contained in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Amendment) Act 1976, but for other reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sometimes people do not like the personalities involved or the direction the trade union is taking. Sometimes they object to paying their dues. In my experience, lots of trade unionists have come to me and said "I think I should reconsider my membership because the trade union contribution has gone up from 2s. 6d. to 3s. 6d."—as it was in those days. One finds those people are never ready, when they object on grounds of that kind, to say that they will forgo the rights that have been won by the trade unions. Indeed, they are usually the first in the queue for some of those rights. They are the first on the clock to leave, they are the first if there is some clothing concession, and so on. So I am not persuaded by the arguments that have been put forward, although there are those who genuinely object on religious or conscientious grounds. Where that has happened—we all know those people; most of us have experience of them— accommodation has been found for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has referred to the TUC guidelines, where it is explicitly spelt out. The employers, too—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand fully the right hon. Gentleman's point. He is saying that, if one is obtaining rights and benefits, one should also have an obligation in return. That is all very well within the trade union movement, but it would be more persuasive and convincing—to me, at any rate—if, at the same time, the trade union movement had shown in its recent conduct that it accepted that it also had obligations to the nation as a whole and that it would not bring down the profitability and the job prospects of other people.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By and large, over the last few years the trade unions have contributed a great deal to the nation. I do not

	<span class='label label-info column'>749</span>
think that what the hon. Gentleman has just mentioned is relevant to the matter. under discussion. But I can give chapter and verse where the nation, in one sense or other, has experienced periods of economic hardship and where the trade unions have made a significant contribution. I think of the voluntary incomes policies, for example, undertaken during the previous Labour Government. They contributed significantly at that time. It is true that the policies caused all kinds of anomalies in certain respects, but they contributed significantly to bringing down the rate of inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Secretary of State—he is probably the only person in the Government who would—would love to go back to an arrangement which would gain that voluntary commitment from the trade union movement to assist the nation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To suggest, therefore, as the hon. Gentleman is suggesting, that the trade unions have not contributed, is wholly fallacious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What do employers have to say about all this? On Second Reading, I pointed out that the Engineering Employers' Federation had grave misgivings about clause 6 of the Bill and this subsection in particular. Mr. Frodsham, the director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the clause would allow individuals to chop and change within unions as well as objecting to membership of any union on principle. That would lead not so much to fragmentation of bargaining arrangements but to squabbling over minor issues."</p></blockquote>
Mr. Porter, the head of industrial relations of the Engineering Employers' Federation, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have to say that in engineering there are not very many problems that will be solved by the kind of measures proposed."</p></blockquote>
We know that, too. The whole history of the matter is peppered with examples where one body after another—an employers' organisation, a Royal Commission—has come out firmly against outlawing the closed shop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Donovan report, of course— compiled by very eminent people considering the matter for months on end—including such members as Lord Robens, who at that time was not necessarily a card-carrying member of the Labour Party; we know
	<span class='label label-info column'>750</span>
how far he has gone since—stated in 1968, in paragraph 602:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In our view prohibition of the closed shop must be rejected. It is better to recognise that under proper safeguards a closed shop can serve a useful purpose and to devise alternative means of overcoming the disadvantages which accompany it."</p></blockquote>
I could read even more of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe, therefore, that the amendments must be rejected by the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith), during an intervention, asked the question: if Parliament passed a law, would people reject that law? We ought to know, from previous experience, that it is the easiest thing in the world to pass a law. The Government produce a Bill with 18 or 80 clauses. They have a majority of 40 or so in the House of Commons. There is a good Second Reading debate, and a Committee stage of 50 or 60 sittings; the Bill goes to the House of Lords and, after the ritualistic tussle there, it all comes back and goes on to the statute book. But it does not necessarily alter people's behaviour. That is why the Secretary of State wants to proceed so cautiously. He says, in quite optimistic terms, that he wants to put on to the statute book a durable measure that will be accepted by the people. If he were to go down the road suggested in the amendment, there would be no hope of getting anything durable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cyril Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a corollary to what he says, does the right hon. Gentleman accept that if we go down the road suggested by the Minister, there is a hope of getting some agreement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I have said on Second Reading and outside the House of Commons that I think this Bill will do more harm than good on the whole. There are some less contentious fragments that will survive an incoming Labour Government, but this Government have another 41/4 years to go, barring accidents, so no doubt the measure will reach the statute book and we shall see how it works in practice. I do not think it will do much good, and that is why we set so much store by the voluntary guides on picketing and the closed shop in this guide book, which are quoted with approval by the right hon. Gentleman and the Under-Secretary, and others in Government. Those guides are the best means of achieving good industrial
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0904">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>751</span>
relations, providing they are carried out in both the spirit and the letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By and large, the clause generally is a recipe for trouble making and nit-picking. It will shunt some of these issues back into the courts and will not work. Broadly, it will be a disaster. Certainly, if the amendments were accepted, I am afraid the result would be even worse, and that is why the Opposition oppose them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the Secretary of State finds himself in a very difficult position in trying to appease the hard-liners in the Tory ranks. He knows what happened in 1971 when the closed shop was practically abolished. It was not abolished in the strict sense of the amendment, being tied up with theoretical ballots, and so on, and, in essence, any employer could set in train machinery to abolish the closed shop on his premises. However, in spite of that, not one employer, as far as I know, took advantage of that legislation to secure a closed shop. If it was unacceptable then, if it is now unacceptable to the CBI, whence comes this overwhelming volume of support to suggest that the closed shop, as set out in the amendment, could be instituted now? There is no demand whatever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want to express a point of view that might have been made on the other side of the Committee. I shall take off my trade union hat and submit the employer's point of view. There are employers who would not like these amendments to be carried. There are employers who have agreed voluntarily in negotiations with their trade unions to have a pre-entry closed shop. The pre-entry closed shop means that no one can secure employment in a particular work place unless he is a member of a recognised union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result, employers might say that they are being deprived of the opportunity to use their own judgment about whether or not to enter the agreements. In fact, some employers might say that it is a denial of individual liberty—I hope that the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) is listening. Employers might demand the right to say " I have provided the capital and the machinery for this firm. I have built up the firm, and I have entered into a voluntary agreement to recognise only trade union members. Now this is denying me my individual liberty to decide what to do with my business."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>752</span>
There are employers who will take that attitude, but they will be in a precarious position if the amendment is accepted. They might face imprisonment, because the proposed subsection (1A) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be unlawful for an employer to require any person to become a member of a trade union as a condition of that person obtaining or continuing in employment with that employer."</p></blockquote>
The employer might say "I am not prepared to carry out that legislation. I have entered into a voluntary agreement. I am going to keep my word with the union." But from a business point of view, he might say "I cannot afford to stand up to the union. It will cause industrial chaos. I am therefore not prepared to carry out that legislation."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the employer adopts that view, he is adopting an unlawful position. He is committing an illegal act. As far as I know, there are no penalties for so doing. There are no further amendments in the name of the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) or the hon. Member for Hendon, North to say what the penalties would be. If the employer defies the legislation, is he to be fined £500 or £1,000? Will someone take an injunction in the courts and make him follow the legislation, and, if he still refuses, will he be sent to prison for contempt of court?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can well imagine a situation in which employers who adopt that point of view are put in prison. There might be a campaign, as we had with the five lockers in prison. Demonstrations might be organised by the CBI asking that its members should be let out of prison. But I am trying to protect employers from the rash of amendments produced by the hon. Member for Hendon, North.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nowhere does the amendment say what will happen to an employer if he adopts the same attitude as the attitude he adopted in 1971. If he folds his arms and says "I am not prepared to carry out this part of the legislation", the possibility is that he will have to be punished, although the punishment is not set out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a hastily drafted amendment, which has not gone into the consequences in any depth. The names attached to the amendment are a strange combination. It is strange that the hon. Member for Rochdale, a member of a libertarian organisation, should be associated with a hard liner such as the hon. Member for Hendon, North.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0905">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>753</span>
I know that the Tory Party is divided into the wets and the hard liners, and I need not say in which category the hon. Member for Hendon, North belongs. But it is difficult to understand the attitude of the lion. Member for Rochdale. I had always imagined that he, as a member of the Liberal Party, was a big softy who believed in the softly, softly approach to industrial relations. I listened with some attention to his speech during the Committee stage which was taken on the Floor of the House in 1971, when he was opposed to the closed shop. He said so quite specifically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cyril Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not a Member of Parliament in 1971. How could the hon. Gentleman listen to my speech in 1971 when I did not win my seat until October 1974?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I have confused the dates. In some period—it was probably in 1974—the hon. Member made a speech in the House in which he was against the closed shop. If I have the date wrong, I should correct it and say that it was in 1974 and not 1971.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot get away with saying that those people who believe that the issue of a closed shop is a matter of principle are to be divided into those who are wets and whatever was the alternative—doves and hawks. If there are any birds on the Opposition Benches, I should have thought that they were cuckoos who threw their members out of the nest, and parrots who repeat things they have learnt by rote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for that important contribution. I do not know whether it will get us any further in discussing the amendments. I should have thought that the substance of the arguments put forward so far might have drawn the hon. Gentleman to his feet to contradict what I had to say instead of making some absurd remark about bird life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand the hon. Member's attitude, because he has a bad record in relation to trade unions. He talks glibly about freedom for trade unionists, but when he had an opportunity of allowing people the freedom of joining a trade union, he fought like hell to see that the employer won the battle and people were
	<span class='label label-info column'>754</span>
deprived of the elementary privilege, which they have had for 150 years, of joining a trade union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many amendments have been put forward in favour of the closed shop. The argument put forward by the trade unions is that if a member makes a contribution to a union, he is doing so for the purpose of collectively bargaining. If one does not make a contribution, one should not receive the benefits of trade union organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another side to that coin: employers welcome a closed shop because it is much more convenient for employers to deal with one union, particularly if there are numerous employees, rather than dealing with many unions in a minority position. As a consequence, relations, many employers encourage unions to reach closed shop agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem posed by the amendments are formidable. About 1½ million workers work under pre-entry closed shop conditions, about 5 million work in negotiated closed shops, and probably up to 7 million or 8 million workers are working in situations where they have organised 100 per cent. trade unionism in a factory but have reached no agreement with their employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now at one tell stroke, the Government propose to say "This is illegal. This will be unlawful from a certain day". There will be chaos. The Government are employing 1,000 inspectors to look at social security scroungers. There will need to be more inspectors appointed to go round to various firms to find out whether they are working in a secretive manner and are ignoring the law and insulting the Government by carrying on secret closed shops. That is a formidable problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For two people in such stark contrast as the two hon. Members whose names appear on the amendment to get together, possibly in the Tea Room, and hastily draft an amendment without any thought about the consequences, embodying a principle that is absolutely unworkable and then ask the Committee to believe that it can be translated into law, is in the realms of fantasy. I hope that we shall not give credence to this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Possibly for the first time in the Committee the Opposition agree with the Secretary of State that this must be resisted.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0906">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>755</span>
I hope that he will not take that as a precedent as we shall certainly oppose him on other issues in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have spent a good deal of time on these amendments. They do not merit close consideration, and I hope that they will be resisted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jocelyn Cadbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like briefly to state my position on this very important issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have worked in factories, both in the engineering industry and in a certain confectionery company which operates closed shops.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Assistant managing director.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cadbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. That is not true. I actually started on the shop floor. I spent two years working in the "Crunchie" department on the shop floor, so it is not true to say that I went in at the top.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened carefully to what my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) had to say, and I cannot help agreeing in principle with everything he said. I wish to elaborate on one point regarding the closed shop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only does the closed shop give great power to shop stewards but it can, and in my experience in some cases it does, lead to a climate of fear. I do not say that this happens everywhere, but I have seen it happen in at least one factory where I have worked. The fear is this. if an individual or minority of workers in a factory disagree with a union policy and with the people who control the union in that factory and they begin to voice their disagreement, they are liable to be disciplined. The correct jargon is "branching".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give two examples. I worked at the Bournville factory in Birmingham last year, and 300 women—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which union?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cadbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Transport and General Workers' Union. Three hundred women decided to continue working during an unofficial—not official—strike. The T&GWU tried to impose a fine on these women, and ultimately they were threatened with expulsion from the union. This would have meant the loss of their jobs because the factory operates a closed shop. Fortunately, the matter came out in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>756</span>
press, was debated in public, and the union climbed down. Situations like this create a climate of fear and will possibly induce a submissive attitude in the work force.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear that the hon. Gentleman worked on the shop floor, and we can dwell on that point later. But could he tell the Committee whether, when he worked on the shop floor, he was a member of the trade union and was he afraid of the shop stewards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cadbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I joined a different union, the ASTMS, and that union did not have a closed shop. I was asked to join it but not told that I must. I joined because I was not compelled to do so. If someone had told me to join, I should have refused. I was not in fear of the shop steward, but for obvious reasons I was in a somewhat different position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give one further example. In the engineering dispute last year, a gentleman called Mike Savage worked at the British Leyland Long bridge factory. He took a different view from official union policy and endeavoured to persuade people who were at that time engaged in a series of one-and two-day strikes that the strikes were wrong and not in the interests of the employees, and that the employees had not been consulted because there was no ballot. He failed to achieve a change in policy, and when the strike was over he was summoned before a works committee to be disciplined. He chose to leave the company. That is a further example of someone who, I believe, was being intimidated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume that the hon. Gentleman is referring to the series of one-day engineering strikes held last year. Is he aware that it was not only the individual to whom he is referring who would not accept the diktat of the executive council of the union? Neither would thousands of others. The response of the AUEW executive council was that no disciplinary action would be taken against any member who had not obeyed the one-day strikes. If thousands were ignored, why should that one individual be given as an example in this Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cadbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only tell the hon. Gentleman that, from my knowledge of the constituency and of the people who work
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0907">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>757</span>
at that factory, there was very great feeling against the way that that strike was called. The fact that that man felt unable to return is an indication of the climate of fear prevailing in that factory, and that, to me, is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In certain situations the closed shop has become a means of intimidation, but its effect is made worse by other factors. For example, if there is a mass meeting, as has been traditional at the Long bridge factory, this makes things worse because the minority will be less likely to speak up at a mass meeting than to vote in a secret ballot. If shop stewards are not elected on a regular basis—in a factory where I worked recently they were not constantly re-elected—if one disagrees with a shop steward, all one can do is get up a petition against him. It took a brave man to start a petition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cadbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It did. I am just telling hon. Members what happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that much can be done to mitigate the problem of the closed shop where it becomes a coercive force, and I believe that certain of the Bill's proposals go some way towards that. The encouragement of secret ballots will help. The movement towards having shop stewards elected on a regular basis by secret ballot will also help. The Bill will encourage those trends. Furthermore, I think that the Bill will protect individuals who lose or are in danger of losing their jobs as the result of a closed shop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My dilemma is that I am well aware that, whether I like it or not, the closed shop is rooted in our industrial life. I have been part of a management team which went along with it. I accepted it. I do not, therefore, think that it is possible to change overnight the tradition of the closed shop. I feel that to abolish the closed shop outright would create too much divisiveness in the country, and for the reasons that my right hon. Friend has given I do not think that it is practicable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I believe that we should follow the Government's policy as set out in the Bill, which is based on the concept of gradualism and on the overriding need to carry the majority of trade unionists with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am standing here in this room because I was elected by many people who work in
	<span class='label label-info column'>758</span>
the Long bridge factory—car workers, at that factory, there was very great feeling because it is a car workers' constituency.I believe that I was elected on the basis of the proposals set out in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I extend my support to the Secretary of State and my appreciation of the loyalist speech by the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Browne). I support their opposition to the extremist amendments tabled by the unholy axis between the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) and the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst). As the Secretary of State said—I paraphrase— even the CBI has said that the closed shop is part of our way of life at the moment, and therefore the amendments are counterrevolutionary. I am eager to support the Government if the amendments are pressed to a vote tonight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I listened originally to the hon. Member for Rochdale, I thought that he was very plausible. He began to carry me along with him, especially after he was questioned about his own small enterprise. It sounded an idyllic scene—a small firm of perhaps a dozen people where the employer did not know or care whether they belonged to the union, and where the employees no doubt knew each other by their Christian names, and everything was O.K.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rest of British industry is not like that. I am sorry to have to break that news to the hon. Gentleman. Nor is the question so black and white as the hon. Gentleman suggested. It is not a clear case of freedom or tyranny. It is much more complex. There must be a balance between rights and responsibilities. The individual has his rights. Majorities also have rights. We have to strike the balance between them. We have to look at the practical and not at the abstract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rochdale seemed to be talking about abstract ideals rather than real life. I remind him that there are many professions—I am not referring just to the legal profession—in which those who wish to practise have to be members, and if they break the rules they are expelled. That should not be forgotten.

Some people have religious objections to medical treatment. Some people want to opt out of State benefits. Would we excuse them their national insurance contributions? We would not. We insist that they pay them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether this is true of the firm with which the hon. Member for Northfield is associated, but many firms insist that a new worker must join the pension scheme. Is that an intrusion on individual liberty, as joining the union is said to be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of safety. My right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) will correct me if I am wrong, but I suspect that the reason why miners would not be happy to allow non-unionists down the pit is that they would fear for their safety if a stranger were to go down the pit. The situation is the same in many other industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the example of my own industry. A man working on a rotary newspaper press could well lose some of his fingers because of inexpert help. If a newspaper ups the pages and extra labour is brought in, one will want to know that the man one is working with is a capable and fit person. His union card is a certificate of his fitness to do the job. If he was not a union member we would not allow him in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come immediately to the point raised by the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) about our closed shops. They were declared void by the 1971 Act, but that ruling never had the slightest effect. I have worked in closed shops in Fleet Street for 33 years. I can tell the hon. Gentleman from personal experience that not a single member attempted to opt out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Fleet Street we work all through the night. The hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) referred to different sorts of birds. I divide the human race into owls and larks. Some people are good in the morning. They are the larks. Some of us are owls. We only wake up at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning. We have been used to night work. We are quite happy to carry on all night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we ever have an early night here, perhaps the hon. Member for Chippenham would like to come with me to Fleet Street at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning. He could walk through the machine room and ask any of the members whether they had had any objection to staying in those closed
	<span class='label label-info column'>760</span>
shops. They did not. The law was unenforceable and was thus brought into disrepute. The law was made an ass, and I do not think that was a good thing. I am an unreformed, unreconstructed, unashamed, unrepentant advocate of the closed shop of the type that I have known and worked in for 33 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard more from the Conservative Members of the Committee today than I have ever heard before. We seem to have touched a raw nerve. They have a gut feeling about this issue. Their animus against the trade union movement has come out. I wonder why they have all spoken on this issue while remaining mute on everything else. They have dressed the issue up in terms of the protection of the individual, but not many of them have been able to give us examples of how people have been disadvantaged by or have suffered from the closed shop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning we discussed the industrial tribunals. Hundreds of people face unfair dismissal. We asked only that before he took someone's livelihood away the employer should have to show that he had acted reasonably. There was not a murmur then. No Conservative wanted to speak. But on this handful of cases in which it is alleged that someone's livelihood has been damaged by a closed shop, they all want to say something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the closed shop of the type in which I worked, because of the inequity between the worker and the employer. The employer has great strength, power and wealth. The individual has virtually nothing, unless he joins with his fellows. If he does that, and if an injury to one is an injury to all—the employer may want to victimise someone, although he knows that everyone else will stand by him—he will feel more secure. I certainly felt secure in a closed shop, and that is why I now support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rochdale said that he was not against voluntary, 100 per cent. trade union membership. Let us suppose that an industry achieved that. That having been done, what would be wrong in insisting that it remain that way?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general secretary of my trade union came into the House. No doubt, some hon. Members may remember him—George Isaacs. He became Minister of Labour during the war. The then Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, ran the war and he left the home front to the Labour Party. George Isaacs helped improve the life
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0909">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>761</span>
expectancy of our members. I wonder whether hon. Gentlemen would like to hazard a guess at the life expectancy of our members, due to bad working conditions. It was 40. They died at 40 because of the ink fly, the paper dust, the noise—we work in 108dB of noise, although I do not know whether hon. Members will understand what that means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The union fought to change that and to get better conditions. As a result, we have a gut feeling for our union and for closed shops. There is no compulsion of any description. When, in 1971, the law rendered them void, it did not have the slightest effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, it means discipline. But if one does not want discipline, one should not work in a factory. Does not the employer expect discipline? Any organisation expects some discipline. I have already given a couple of examples. In one case we had a dispute with 	<i>The Times,</i>where our members were breaking an agreement. The general secretary expelled the entire chapel because they were not delivering the agreement with the employer. He said that members could rejoin the union if they agreed to abide by the constitution, which required that they obey the rules of the executive. I am sure that that was not considered tyranny by the then Secretary of State. It was considered good order and military discipline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The type of amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Rochdale and the hon. Member for Hendon, North is unwise and unenforceable. It is rather like King Canute saying that the tide will not come in. The tide will still come in. The law would be unenforceable and unrealistic. On that basis, I support the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend invited me and the hon. Member for Rochdale not to press the amendment to a Division. He put forward cogent and reasonable arguments, but I do not feel able to go along with his request. I think that the amendment is so important in principle—albeit, as one hon. Member said, abstract principle—that I do not think it possible to let it go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that my right hon. Friend and some of my hon. Friends have taken a pragmatic, practical view. But I do not believe that the freedom and liberty involved are unreasonable or impractical to implement in the way suggested. I

appreciate that some of my hon. Friends have seen this as a matter of principle, too, but believe that the practical questions are of the greater importance. respect that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I cannot respect is the arguments of Opposition Members who have not addressed themselves to any matter of principle but have simply and nakedly sought to protect a vested interest in trade union power. I accept that they may wish to do that, and have every right to do it, but I do not believe that it is right for it to be done at the expense of the rest of the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not my intention to detain the Committee long. I am aware that there are further amendments on the Paper that will allow us further discussion on the principles involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) understands that we shall put forward more robustly the arguments in favour of the closed shop when we deal with our amendments. I do not accept that my hon. Friends did not put constructive arguments. We have presented the case which shows the nonsense and unwork ability of the amendment standing in his name and that of the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What drew me to my feet was the moving story told by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Cadbury) about his years of toil on the shop floor. I was deeply touched and recognise that he must now be regarded as one of the Tory Party's leading experts on industrial relations. The fact that he is a relative, though I do not know how closely related, of one of the founders of the company I accept as purely immaterial to his many years of experience in the trade union movement solving the industrial relations problems of his company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If those of us who started work in shipyards and factories at 14 or 15 take a different view of industrial relations, the hon. Member for Northfield will, I am sure, understand our attitude, as we, of course, understand his. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]Does the hon. and learned Gentleman wish to speak?

I think that it was something about the value of people having knowledge of industrial relations from the other side of the divide, as it were. In that case, I agree. I was merely expressing the hope that the hon. Member for Northfield will understand the point of view of those of us who have worked all our lives in industry, from the moment of leaving school until being elected to Parliament, and will recognise that we do not regard his view on both industrial relations and trade unions as being necessarily objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regard the clause as drafted as a disaster. It is only a question of the margin of disaster between the clause as so far drafted by the Secretary of State and the amendment by which the hon. Member for Rochdale and his co-partner in the exercise have sought to change it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the nonsense we have heard tonight about fear generated by shop stewards and convenors is as nothing to the fear that has been exhibited in the Committee. If some hon. Members had the courage of their convictions, they would vote for the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have news for hon. Members. They need not worry too much, because the Opposition will be supporting the Secretary of State. They can have their little rebellion. They can go back and show their constituents the speeches that they made in Committee. They will even be able to say that they voted against the Government. Or are they afraid of the Front Bench? Are they afraid of the power of the Government Whip and of the retribution that will fall on their heads when the Chief Whip reads of the rebellion tomorrow? That is the real issue at stake tonight. Conservative hon. Members who have spoken have clearly indicated that they fully support the outrageous sentiments and reactionary statements of the hon. Member for Hendon, North. At least he has had the guts not only to make those statements but also to back his words with action. Other hon. Members opposite will not do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the substance of what I wish to say. I want us to move to a Division. I want to see what will happen in that vote. I shall seek to speak on many of the issues that have been raised in this important debate during the discussion on other amendments
	<span class='label label-info column'>764</span>
to clause 6, which is one of the most important parts of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cyril Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee long. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) for appealing to hon. Members to have the courage of their convictions. It is delightful to find an opponent of the amendment appealing to hon. Members to support it. As a Whip both in the last Government and in the present Opposition, the hon. Gentleman speaks from experience of what happens to those who vote against the Whip. Admittedly his experience is with a different party, but we may take it that he knows what would happen in his party and presumes that that is what would happen in other parties. Before hon. Members laugh at that suggestion, I am bound to say that I suspect that the hon. Gentleman is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were a Minister replying to the debate, I should probably begin by saying that we had had an interesting and informative debate, and that I was grateful to the hon. Gentleman for tabling the amendment that allowed the debate to take place. In fact I believe that we have had an interesting and informative debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I should like to set the record straight on the drafting of the amendment and possible collusion between the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) and myself. If hon. Members care to look at past Amendment Papers, they will see that I alone tabled the amendment. However, last Thursday there were doubts whether, for domestic reasons, I would be able to be here to move the amendment were it called on that day. In order to make sure that the amendment was moved, the hon. Member for Hendon, North, kindly acceded to my request that he sign the amendment. Then at least it could have been moved if I had not been present. There was no collusion between us on the drafting of the amendment. However, I am grateful for his support. Like the hon. Member for Newton, I admire his courage in having given that support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may surprise hon. Members to discover that the actual drafting of the amendment was done by the legalistic brains at the National Chamber of Commerce. Any suggestion that it was drafted by someone who did not know anything about the drafting of amendments would be mistaken.

One feature that interested me as I listened to the debate was the similarity between the Ministers of different Governments. I have sat on the Committees on all the Employment Bills since 1972—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]I think that I am correct in saying that. I may be wrong, but I think that I am right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not challenging that, but the hon. Gentleman's remark about the similarities between Ministers of different Governments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the benefit of the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) I shall continue. I was about to say that every speech on the subject of employment that I have heard from Ministers since 1972 has been along the lines that we can only do what the unions are prepared to accept. That is what we have heard tonight from the Secretary of State. It is what we heard from the Secretary of State in the Labour Government. Whatever we do, we are told, we have to be careful not to upset the unions. We must carry them along with us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would be a perfectly laudable exercise if only in practice that happened or was even likely to happen. If I had some kind of assurance or indication that Opposition Members were prepared to persuade the trade unions that this was a reasonable approach and therefore one that should be accepted, I should back down rather than upset that spirit of unanimity. I should not force the issue. But, as we all know, there will not be acceptance of the spirit of the clause or of the Bill. I forecast that when we debate clause 6 stand part, the Opposition will oppose it even in its present form standing part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that basis, those members of the Committee who feel as I do should say that if there cannot be unanimity, if we cannot go along an agreed road, we are entitled, as the Opposition are, to go along the road that we believe is the correct road—not the road of convenience, but the road that is more in accord with the principles that we hold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard much about the rights of unions and employers, the relationships of those who wish to belong to a union, and so on. But we have heard little about the right of the individual, the person who does not wish to belong to a
	<span class='label label-info column'>766</span>
trade union. That is what my amendment is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Cadbury) spoke of fear, and the hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) challenged him. But I think that the hon. Member for Northfield was right because it is a fact. I am not saying that in every factory in the country there are people who are frightened of shop stewards. Of course, there are not. But there are factories in which there are people who are afraid of the shop stewards and their powers and the way that the shop stewards will use them if people disagree with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where? As usual, the hon. Gentleman is making one of his wide sweeping statements which he probably hopes will be picked up by the press. He has not given any details of the localities. Will he now accept from me the wide sweeping statement that there are far more people afraid of the power of employers than of the power of the trade unions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not think that the hon. Gentleman would. But will he accept from me that all our shop stewards are regularly elected by secret ballot and that our committees are elected each quarter by secret ballot? So why should they be afraid of the people whom they themselves elect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Suffice it to say that there has recently been a tacit example of a shop steward who was elected by ballot. We saw what happened to him when workers realised that this was the moment that they could rise up against the chairman of the shop stewards, or whoever he was. All the pious, poppycock, naive sentiments and arguments that have been expressed today by the Opposition do not carry me far along the road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that any man has the right to belong to a trade union. I said this morning that if the Opposition were to table an amendment that gave a man the right to belong to a trade union, I would vote for it. Of course I would. I believe that a man has that right. But I also believe that he has the right not to belong. That is what the amendment is about.
