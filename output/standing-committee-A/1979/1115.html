	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Reginald Eyre)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 148, in page 34, line 33, leave out "at the time" and insert "on the date".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Government amendments Nos. 149 to 151.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first three are minor drafting amendments, and the next is a little more substantial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first two amendments change references to "the time" of the re-registration or registration to "the date" of the re-registration or registration. This is a more helpful concept in this connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third amendment brings subsection (3) correctly into line with subsection (1). Subsection (1) refers to the transfer of non-cash assets "to the company or another", whereas subsection (3) refers to the transfer "to the company" or the transfer "to the company's nominee". The amendment therefore replaces this phrase with "another person" for the sake of consistency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last amendment changes subsection (4) of clause 26. The new paragraph (	<i>a</i>) of the subsection is in essence the same as the whole of subsection (4) as it is now drafted. Paragraph (	<i>b</i>) introduces another exception to clause 26(1). This exception is for agreements entered into by the company under the supervision of the court, or an officer authorised by the court for the purpose, for the transfer of an asset to the company or to another. This exception was included in the 1978 Bill and, on further reflection, I think that there is no reason for excluding it from the present Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>No. 150, in page 34, line 44, leave out "the company's nominee "and insert" another person".</p>
	<p>No. 151, in page 35, line 18, leave out subsection (4) and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) Subsection (1) above shall not apply to the following agreements for the transfer of an asset for a consideration to be given by the company, that is to say—
	<ol>
	<li>where it is part of the ordinary business of the company to acquire or arrange for other persons to acquire assets of a particular description, an agreement entered into by the company in the ordinary course of its business for the transfer of an asset of that description to it or such a person, as the -case may be; or</li>
	<li>an agreement entered into by -the company under the supervision of the court, or an officer authorised by the court for the purpose, for the transfer of an asset to the company or to another.".—[	<i>Mr Eyre.</i>]</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 157, in page 36, line 4, after "contravention", insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"then, subject to subsection (8) below—".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 158, 159, 145 and 143.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the amendments are concerned with what is likely to be a most unusual case. To put the matter very briefly, clause 26 controls a limited class of agreements entered into within a specified period by public companies with certain of their members, under which the company acquires assets from the member. The consideration which the company provides is not specified; it may be anything—cash, other assets, or even shares in the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in this last case that problems arise. The sanctions set out in clause 26 when the clause is not complied with involve the company retrieving whatever consideration it has provided, and the agreement becomes void. If these rules applied where the consideration provided by the company was the allotment of shares in the company, we should be involved in the company retrieving its own shares and the promises to pay up the shares being unenforceable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is in complete conflict with the policy of the Bill where the rules in clauses 20 to 24 for the payment up of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0104">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>181</span>
shares are not complied with. In those cases, the shares are to be validly allotted, the undertakings to pay them up are enforceable; there is frequently an additional statutory liability in allottee and holders but the court is given wide power to order relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill seeks to introduce consistency by providing that where the company breaches clause 26, where the consideration it provides is the allotment of shares the sanctions in clause 27(7) will not apply, but the sanctions provided for clauses 20 to 24 will apply. This is not in question in the present amendments. What they seek to do is to iron out defects in the provisions, achieving consistency and bringing them into line with the new terminology elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to take the opportunity to raise a general question which arises on clause 26 and the group of clauses of which it is a part. I refer to the role of the independent person on whom we are placing a great deal of weight in this and the whole group of clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to undermine this independent person or to underestimate his importance. It is invaluable for shareholders and people dealing in a company's affairs to have expert independent advice. It reminds me of Hamlet when he says
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>182</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Give me that man</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>In my heart's core"</p></blockquote>
Here I would say "Give me that man who is an independent person and I will trust him at my shareholders' meeting"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are here building up an important body of detailed company law for a somewhat limited set of circumstances, namely, those envisaged in clause 24. Shareholders need independent advice on a much wider range of circumstances. I therefore draw the Committee's attention to the lop-sided character of the Bill. It goes into such formidable detail on this narrow range of circumstances which may arise in the course of a company's existence, but it does not give to shareholders the continuing independent advice that they should be able to obtain from the auditors, outside directors or other independent persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that we are going into great detail here. The problem is responding to pressure. It has been felt, in respect of this set of circumstances, that every time anyone buys shares or is considering an amendment to his portfolio he will need this independent person who is able to have access to the company's records and to obtain the facts of the situation. There is here a lacuna in our company law which should be remedied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since we have paused in romping along with the Government amendments, perhaps I may raise a point which arises on this clause and on the whole group of clauses—23 to 28—which deal with non-cash assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to understand why that phrase has been used in the Bill, and particularly in this group of clauses which require this advice on a company acquiring or allotting shares for the non-cash assets. It seems a forced phrase—almost an Americanized Anglo-Saxon term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are familiar with the term "otherwise than in cash". But here we have the phrase "non-cash asset" throughout the group of clauses of which this clause is part, where there is some distinction between the term "non-cash asset" and an "undertaking to transfer" or a "contract to transfer".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that later on the Notice Paper—I do not seek to debate it now, Sir Stephen—there is a definition of a non-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0105">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>183</span>
cash asset and an addition by a Government amendment to that definition. I think that it would assist us in our considering this group of clauses if we were given a little information about the significance of the term "non-cash asset", and why that phrase was used in preference to other phrases which seem far clearer in meaning, such as the phrase that I quoted—"otherwise than in cash". I should be grateful if my hon. Friend could tell us why the phrase "non-cash asset" was chosen. Does he feel that it defines what is intended by the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse what was said by the hon. Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams). In general, I should have thought that the more advice was available the better. That is true over a wide range of human activity. It is recognised nowadays as being true in relation to employees, to consumers, to neighbours and so on I have spent the last five years doing what I can to make advice more readily available to people in any situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We live in a complicated world, and nothing but the enhancement of justice can come from making people aware of their rights and their liabilities. The philosophy that prevailed at one time, that if people are told too much about their entitlement they may make a nuisance of themselves by claiming them, is evaporating. That is especially true where the respective parties are not in balance—where there is imbalance between the expertise available and the power to exercise it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Truth may occasionally emerge out of the mouths of babes and suckling, but in financial and company matters it is more likely to emerge from the mouths of experts. I therefore endorse what the hon. Gentleman said, and the Opposition will be interested in the Government's reaction to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) for asking about the role of the independent person who has to perform important expert functions in connection with these clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the importance of the matter. The right hon. and learned Member for Warley, West (Mr. Archer) underlined some of the difficulties in our com-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>184</span>
plicated modern society of arranging for the desirable advice to be available on occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We made clear at an earlier stage, when my hon. Friend was outside the Committee, that we shall look again at the wording of the provisions affecting the independent person who is so important for the performance of this expert function. We shall therefore return to the matter at a later stage. My hon. Friend in fact went rather wider than the implications about expert advice within these clauses. I believe that we shall have a chance on Report to discuss those implications, which were partly touched on by the remarks of the right hon. and learned Member for Warley, West. There are implications regarding audit committees and many other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) referred rather critically to the use of the words "non-cash assets". I am glad to say that that phrase now occurs only in clause 26. It has been removed from all other clauses by Government amendments. In clause 26 the phrase reflects the directive requirement which speaks specifically of "assets".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At an earlier stage we referred to the use of words in a similar matter. My right hon. Friend referred to such a term as a "forced" term. We mentioned the Oxford Dictionary at one stage. We shall search through the Oxford Dictionary to see whether there is any possible alternative to the forced term "non-cash assets". If we can make a helpful suggestion or an improvement, I shall be glad to try to please my right hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Trade (Mr. Cecil Parkinson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 160, in page 38, line 19, leave out from "the" to "and" in line 20 and insert "whole of any premium or, if the case so requires, so much of that aggregate as is treated as paid up".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take Government amendment No. 161.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the second of these amendments first. It is a minor drafting amendment which removes paragraph (	<i>b</i>) because it becomes superfluous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (6) of clause 28 seeks to identify agreements covered by subsection (7) of clause 26. The reference is at the moment to the agreement mentioned in paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of that subsection, but the reference to paragraph (	<i>b</i>) is unnecessary as the agreement is also referred to in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) and in the body of the subsection. We seek to remove paragraph (	<i>b</i>) because it adds nothing to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first amendment, No. 160, puts right a small defect in subsection (4), which sets out the guiding principles that the court is to follow in deciding whether to grant relief under clause 28. The first of these is that, broadly, the company should get value for its shares. However, in stating this rule the paragraph says that this money or money's worth should at least equal the nominal value of those shares and the amount of the premium paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it is possible for companies to issue partly paid-up shares. There seems to be no reason why we should not provide in the Bill for this subsection also to cover that eventuality—that the shares on issue are not fully paid up to their nominal value but only partly paid up. If the company can issue partly paid up shares it ought to be possible for the person seeking relief not to be required to pay more than the partly paid up amount of the shares that are on issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment enables us to use that flexibility if the shares on issue are partly paid up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>186</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I presume that if amendment No. 161 is accepted and paragraph (	<i>b</i>) is removed, we shall also remove "(	<i>a</i>)" in subsection (4) and also in the second line of subsection (6) because there will be no (	<i>a</i>) if there is no (	<i>b</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have reason to believe, looking round the Committee Room, that there are people not present officially who do not share my right hon. Friend's view. But I must tell him that I cannot see why, for the point that he made seemed eminently sensible. I was about to say that I shall find out why, but perhaps I can do it earlier than I thought and we can save a letter, since a note has just reached me. All I can say, Sir Stephen, is that I have not the worst handwriting in the world. I have just had it proved to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The advice that I am given is this. Only the reference to (	<i>b</i>) is removed, not paragraph (	<i>b</i>). If that is not a satisfactory answer, I shall write to my right hon. Friend about the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The final part of paragraph (	<i>a</i>) of subsection (6) follows the recommendation of the Jenkins committee on company law. It recommended in paragraph 198 of its report that at an adjourned meeting of the holders of shares of the class concerned, one person holding any of the issued shares of that class should constitute a quorum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what the Bill provides. It meets that recommendation. It does not, however, permit such a person to appoint a proxy. There seems to be no sensible reason why, if one shareholder can be a quorum, he should not at the same time be allowed to appoint a proxy if he cannot attend. This amendment, therefore, in pursuance of the recommendation of the Jenkins committee, gives the shareholder the right to appoint a proxy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As there has been so much honey in the relationship between the Opposition and the Government side, and between Back Benchers and Ministers, it is perhaps not totally inappropriate to remember that in closing the cell, so I believe, the bee invariably stings each little segment. If I adapt Shakespeare again—where the bee stings, there sting I. It is for the good of the drafting of a complex Bill of this kind to point out one of the other maxims—that it is always possible to improve a draft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that this clause has been lifted without change from the previous Bill which went through Committee. It has itself been through all its stages in the House of Lords. Now, at this late stage, the Department is seeking to make an amendment which, when we examine it, is so transparently and obviously needed that one wonders why these words were not in the text from the start.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nameless people whose word is law and who draft these clauses are no doubt fallible and human, like ourselves. Nevertheless, we are hastening through a Bill which at this point can be seen to be defective. I have to ask myself, and also the Minister, whether there may be other such errors still undetected at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

him. It would, indeed, be miraculous if any single piece of legislation had been passed since the House began legislating which, with the benefit of hindsight, could not be improved in minor details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that, when the Bill has gone back to the Lords and finally becomes an Act, when we start to work through it we shall receive letters from various people saying "We have just noticed, now that we are applying the legislation, that there is a special little point that should have been dealt with". We do not pretend that the legislation is perfect. We are trying to make it as good as it can possibly be. I believe that the officials—if I am allowed to mention them, Sir Stephen—are to be congratulated rather than criticised for their continuous efforts to improve the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon.

	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause deals with the variation of rights attached to special classes of shares. Each subsection then sets out the way in which those rights may be attached, and how the law differs according to the form of attachment. Subsection (2) refers to the rights being attached
	<br><blockquote><p>"otherwise than by the memorandum".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>190</span>
Later subsections refer to their being attached
	<br><blockquote><p>"by the memorandum or otherwise".</p></blockquote>
I am puzzled by the words "or otherwise". Indeed, is it even necessary to include the phrase "by the memorandum or otherwise"? As I understand it, that leaves it at large as to how the rights may be attached. Why, then, do we have to say "by the memorandum or otherwise"? I presume that "or otherwise" has an 	<i>ejusdem generis</i> meaning with the memorandum, though I cannot think of anything that is of the same kind as the memorandum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Either it means something or it is a superfluous phrase. If it means something, what is meant by the words "or otherwise"? How can rights be attached to shares otherwise than by the memorandum, or the alteration of the memorandum by a special resolution?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Stevens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the articles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says, "In the articles". But the clause speaks elsewhere about rights being attached by the memorandum or the articles. There must have been some purpose in varying the use of those several phrases. I wonder what it was. If there is no purpose, quite a few words could be omitted from the clause. For example, subsection (3)(	<i>a</i>), which reads
	<br><blockquote><p>"the rights are attached to a class of shares in the company by the memorandum or otherwise"</p></blockquote>
could simply say
	<br><blockquote><p>"the rights are attached to a class of shares in the company"—</p></blockquote>
unless something significant is meant by the phrase, " by the memorandum or otherwise ".

	<p>11 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be happy to try. As I understand the matter, it would be quite possible for the articles of the company to give the directors the right to issue shares with such rights as the directors wish to give the shares. So one could have the rights of the shareholders specified in the memorandum or articles, or in a supplementary document issued by the directors, using rights given to them in the articles. It is to

As my hon. Friend said in connection with the previous clause, they might have the power somewhere in the memorandum or articles to attach the rights themselves when allotting the shares.

Amendments Nos. 235 and 236 are really hooks on which to hang new clause 18 so that discussion on that may arise at appropriate places during the Bill's progress where I believe the inflation accounting dimension should be incorporated.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we had a lengthy debate on the matter in connection with the Bill not many months ago, it is not necessary for me to dwell at length on the subject of inflation accounting. Indeed, so much has been said, written and printed about inflation accounting, with very detailed studies made outside the House of the implications and possibilities, that it has become a commonplace that something must be done on these lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the Stock Exchange sliding and Britain awakening to a new sense of realism about our industrial position, the point I wish to make is, that we have to act as a matter of urgency. It is not good enough for accountants to continue with recondite studies of the possible implications of this, that or the other method of taking note of changes in the value of money in dealing with company accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to make a decision at once. We cannot even wait in the hope that there may be another Companies Bill in our next Session in which we can possibly bring something forward for enactment in 1980, 1981 or some later date. The time to act is now—so that all companies should reconsider their position in the light of the changes which have taken place in the value of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My new clause 18, like all drafts, of course, could no doubt be improved, but I believe that it represents a practical formula, namely, that companies should be obliged to produce a statement, in addition to what they do normally in compliance with the Companies Acts, which shows the adjustments required be made to the balance sheets and profit and loss accounts in order to take account of changes in the value of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To cut a long story short, I suggest that in arriving at such a statement companies should simply adopt what method they like, provided that they make clear what method they have adopted. There are many variants favoured by experts, and I believe that a consensus may be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>194</span>
emerging although it has not yet done so. Any form of inflation accounting is better than continued ignorance. If the shareholders are informed of what form of inflation accounting has been adopted, then they can aim off for wind, if that is necessary, or draw their own conclusions about the state of affairs in the company with a far better line of guidance than they can possibly obtain from the virtually meaningless accounts which the companies are obliged to publish under the present Companies Acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see how any harm could be done if my new clause were carried into law at this stage, but I am sure that it would be of enormous benefit—together with my amendment No. 235, in particular—and, therefore, I commend them to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hook upon which I have hung my new clause is the provision that if public companies find themselves to be in a dangerous financial situation they should call a meeting. What could be more appropriate than that the directors should call a meeting to discuss the situation of the company if, on making adjustments to their accounts to take account of changes in the value of money, they discover that they have not been acting properly? I believe that this is common sense and that the Committee should not be advised by my hon. Friend the Minister not to act at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share with my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) a concern about the present high rate of inflation, but I believe that we should be very careful about going for instant remedies in company law. I feel that what we are seeking to create is a set of rules which will apply for companies in the medium-term and long-term future and not just in the short-term. I suppose one dare say that we hope that by the time the Bill becomes an Act inflation will be well below its present rate; but even if it is not, it would be dangerous to jump to an instant solution of the type that my hon. Friend suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first reason why I think it dangerous is that the accountancy profession is, I understand, absolutely split about how inflation can be accounted for in company accounts. It would be dangerous to have different sets of principles applying. That is my second reason for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0111">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>195</span>
not agreeing with the amendment. If directors were given the liberty that my hon. Friend suggests in his new clause, they would simply be able to adopt any form of accounting for inflation that suited them. I do not think that that would necessarily be in the interests of shareholders, particularly those whom my hon. Friend tries to protect—namely, those who are prejudiced by the deteriorating position of the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, while sharing the general concern that my hon. Friend expressed, I do not feel that his amendment is the right way to go about seeking a solution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) for raising a most important point. It is perhaps true to say that virtually all concerned in the country were consulted about inflation accounting before the House of Commons finally got round to debating the subject on the previous Bill for the first time. You will recall, Sir Stephen, that on that occasion we had a very full, interesting and well-informed debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must tell my hon. Friend immediately—because I know that he likes to know these things—that I shall advise the Committee not to accept either his amendment or his new clause. I am quite happy to go through the various, very important technical defects in the new clause if he so wishes. But I assure him that it is technically defective in at least three most important ways, and it would therefore not be a sensible new clause to insert into the Bill. If he wishes me to deal with the details, I shall be happy to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hate leaning on technical defects as an answer to a point of principle, which is really what my hon. Friend has raised this morning. Therefore, I shall say a few words about the Government's approach to inflation accounting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I am sure that my hon. Friend is aware that his proposals would make every company adopt inflation accounting. I refer not to the large or medium-sized companies, but to every company in the country. Many people find present-day accounts very hard to under-stand, and the type of accounts that could emerge from the changes that my hon. Friend proposes would have very little value for many small proprietor-managed businesses that are content to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>196</span>
have their accounts prepared on the present basis because they understand them and are, I am sure, fully aware of the significance on them of inflation. It seems an unnecessary imposition to say that each company in the land must prepare its accounts on the basis that the Government suggests, not on the basis that the shareholder wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must never lose sight of the fact that the accounts of small companies are prepared for the benefit of the shareholders, and we should not place too many statutory impositions on the small company. It is a case of overkill to say that this principle must apply to every company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The accountancy profession has been working very hard on this problem. I do not interpret the difficulties that it has been having and the controversy that has occurred within the profession as a sign of weakness. This is an extremely complicated and difficult subject, and I do not think that the profession should be criticised for the fact that it is having to evolve a solution after a great deal of consultation and hard work. Frankly, I think that the first proposals put forward were not satisfactory and that exposure draft 24—the so-called Hyde approach—is better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend knows, in our Green Paper we say that we intend in the next Bill to legislate to make it clear that companies that so wish may prepare their accounts on a current cost account basis, so that if the company issues accounts to its shareholders on that basis it will be meeting its statutory obligation to report to the shareholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We differ with my hon. Friend on the question of making this a matter of absolute statutory obligation. I know that my hon. Friend believes that it should be a matter of statutory obligation. However, I think that he overstated his case when he said that it is a case of inflation accounts or continued ignorance. I believe that it is perfectly possible to draw very specific and accurate conclusions about the affairs of a company on the basis of the present accounts. Accounts are continually evolving, and shareholders are being given more information. I therefore think that even my hon. Friend might conclude that it is not a simple choice between continued ignorance or inflation accounting. The question before us is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0112">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>197</span>
whether inflation accounting will make us better informed, not whether it will end a period of continued ignorance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We take the view that the accountancy profession should be allowed to get on with the job that it has set itself. Let us see how exposure draft 24 actually works in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend knows, companies will be preparing their accounts on a historic cost basis but will be interpreting them with supplementary memorandum accounts based upon current cost accounting principles. The two systems will therefore be running in parallel, so we shall be able to see which supplies the shareholders with most information. The shareholders themselves will be able to make up their minds whether they are better informed as a result of the changes. Under our next set of proposals, as we have said in the Green Paper, companies which come to the conclusion that this is the best way of informing their shareholders will have the right to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We prefer the gradualist approach. I believe that the sudden imposition of a statutory obligation to move to current cost accounting could cause chaos and could spread ignorance. I do not believe that it would necessarily result in people being better informed. Let us try the Hyde proposals. Let us see those proposals in action and give companies the right to make up their own minds. Let us not forget also that shareholders' meetings may give instructions to directors. Shareholders can say "The directors now have this right, and we think it is in our interests that the accounts should be prepared on a different basis"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not against the principle that my hon. Friend enunciates so well. We simply prefer a more gradualist approach. There is not inactivity in this matter. The accountancy profession is working hard. The Government have put forward a consultative document. We are open-minded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances, therefore, I hope that my hon. Friend will feel that it would be unwise to press his amendment to a Division now. We understand his motives, but we do not think that his present proposals would achieve his objectives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>198</span>
outline the difficulties that I find in the amendment and new clause. As I understand it, in both these cases the statement which will be prepared by the directors to put before the shareholders merely has to take account of changes in the value of money. As I understand it, that may be done automatically by accepting an inflation figure issued by the Government, it may be at the discretion of the directors to take their own inflation figure, or it may be done by some professional valuation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if it takes into account only changes in the value of money, that is not really what the shareholders want to know. They want to know the change in the value of the company's assets. That may sound like the same thing. But what happens if one takes the value of the assets and automatically increases it according to the index of retail prices when the assets happen to be real property or even not goods that are sold retail in that way? There are many ways of taking merely the change in the value of money which will not give the shareholders any information about their property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take an example. I must declare an interest here. I am a director, though only with a director's fee—I do not hold any equity shares—in a trust company which holds and manages property. In recent years the value of that property has increased by far more than the inflation figure. It would therefore be quite false to tell the directors, "An inflation figure of 16 per cent. has been applied and that is what we think the property is worth". In the last two years, the value of most of the properties has risen by 50 per cent. But if I said that the general inflation rate was 50 per cent., no doubt I should be shot down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The shareholders want to know the value of their assets. To that extent, I do not believe that the present wording of the amendment and the new clause would provide the shareholders with the necessary information. My hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) may have a complete answer to this, but that is my reading of his proposals as they stand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In moving the amendment and introducing the new clause, my object was to draw from the Minister a statement of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0113">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>199</span>
Government's intentions with regard to inflation accounting. I have not been entirely successful. Whilst I think that my hon. Friend recognises that there is a problem, he does not seem to be ready to come forward with a solution. On the basis of what he has said this morning, I am therefore left in some doubt as to whether the Government intend to include proposals with regard to inflation accounting even in their next much-heralded Companies Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that it might be tedious for very small companies to have to produce more still in the way of accounts. But even a small company needs to know whether it is solvent, whether it will be able to replace its capital or whether it is heading inevitably towards bankruptcy. So even though it may not go through the motions called for in new clause 18 as a formal routine, it needs to go through something of the kind or it will be on the road to ruin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But even if we excluded small companies, as we certainly could—or we could omit private companies—it seems to me that the shareholders are entitled to have a statement from the company. If they are entitled to statements of profit and loss and a balance sheet under the Companies Acts, if they have any basis of entitlement to expect the directors to produce accounts at all, they are entitled to expect that those accounts should have a real meaning. To produce accounts in a form which takes no account of current cost accounting principles or changes in the value of money does not seem to me to be complying with the spirit of the Companies Acts even if it complies with the letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shareholders are not all as expert as my hon. Friend. He said that it is possible to deduce quite accurately from the present form of accounts what is the real situation of a company, in spite of the fact that the accounts do not aim to take account of changes in the value of money. For experts, no doubt, that is true. But how many boards of directors are sufficiently expert to be able to make their own deductions unless their accountants bring them forcibly to their notice? Also, how many investors are capable of making the necessary deductions? This is particularly relevant in view of the inevitably limited amount of detail published by companies about the replacement of their assets, which is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>200</span>
possibly the most important aspect of the matter. It is possible that among institutional investors there are people with the necessary shrewdness and insight to make their own deductions. But while Parliament delays in regard to current cost accounting, many boards and many investors are left in the dark. That is weakening the whole basis of the capital market in this country because it is not founded on fact, only on supposition. The Government cannot afford to be complacent with that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that the accounting profession is displaying amazing expertise and professionalism in these detailed debates on the different ways in which changes in the value of money could be tackled. My hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Baker) and the Minister feel that the accountancy profession should be allowed to continue with this enjoyable and recondite study. It has taken many years to get as far as it has. Agreement has not yet been reached, and it may be many years before it is. Perhaps the Government are to bring pressure to bear on the accounting profession to bring forward a broad recommendation which could be included in the next Companies Act. If so, the Minister should say so now, and not leave us or, indeed, the general public, in any doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I envisage that when the next Companies Bill is brought forward the debates among the experts will still be continuing, and it will be too soon for the Department to move. Consultations will be in progress and the principle of unripe time will apply. The House of Commons will be told that we must leave the experts to continue their studies and that there is no need to worry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there is a need to worry. The present state of the Stock Exchange is an indication of the need to worry. I should like to shake the Department and, I am sorry to say, my hon. Friend, who is not a complacent person, out of their present mood. It would be to the advantage of the professions, the investors, the shareholders and boards if attention could be drawn to the need for realism on the value of the pound and the value of balance sheets as they stand at present. I hope that if the Minister is content to reply now he will at least

give an undertaking that provisions will be brought forward by the Government in their next Companies Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend and I have debated this subject over a period and we both accept the weaknesses of historically based accounts. There is no argument between us on that. The accounting profession accepts the necessity of coming forward with a statement which will help the shareholders to understand the impact of inflation on accounts. The profession has been working to evolve a set of satisfactory proposals. But as my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) said, what the profession wants to do is not come forward with a gimmicky response to a short-term problem but to make proposals which will be of real assistance to shareholders and will make them better informed about the business in which they have a stake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Frankly, we believe that there is no body with greater expertise on this subject at its disposal than the accountancy profession. The profession has demonstrated that it recognises the importance of the problem and is working very hard to come forward with an acceptable answer. We believe it is getting extremely near to that in exposure draft 24, and that that has a good chance of being finalised as the profession's proposals and becoming incorporated and accepted as a accounting standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we say in the Green Paper on company accounting and disclosure is that the next Bill—the 1980–81 Bill—will include enabling provisions for companies to adopt current cost accounting principles in their main accounts. But it will not be a legal requirement for companies to produce their accounts on a current cost basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, the Green Paper is a consultative document, as are all Green Papers. The Government are listening to advice, and consulting -as widely as possible, and we shall come forward with final proposals. Our mind is not closed on the subject. We have set out our current intentions in the Green Paper and we look forward to the period of consultation. At the end of that time,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>202</span>
we shall come forward with our proposals in the next Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that my hon. Friend did not think that I was being discourteous to him by not discussing the technical defects of new clause 18. However, they are very serious. There are three major defects, which I shall be happy to point out to my hon. Friend, so that if he decides to table the new clause on Report and if the Chair accepts it, that particular line of defence will not be available to the Government. I am sorry to have to tell my hon. Friend that, should he choose to press the issue to a vote this morning, I would have to advise my hon. Friends to vote against the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, it would waste the Committee's time if I were to insist on a vote on a new clause that contained significant defects. However, I do not feel that the matter should be left after a relatively short debate in Committee. I hope that in the selection of matters to be considered on Report my hon. Friend will favour further examination of the question of inflation accounting. From his remarks, I had the feeling that that would indeed be his wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be happy to withdraw the two amendments that we are discussing, and although I should prefer my new clause 18 to stand on the Amendment Paper for the time being, my mood at present would not be to ask the Committee to vote on it. As I have said, I hope that we can return to the matter on Report. If the Minister wishes to intervene before I sit down, that might be to the Committee's convenience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to say that the wish is often the father to the thought, and I should not want my hon. Friend to interpret my original remarks in any way but literally. I shall be happy to point out the technical defects of the new clause. My hon. Friend is a great believer in private enterprise; the rest would be up to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend in anticipation of receiving his advice on the way in which my new clause can be improved, so that, if it is considered on Report, at any rate it will not be defective.

I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) will not feel that my abstention from that debate reflected any lack of interest in the necessity for inflation accounting. Speaking for myself, having heard the respective arguments—which was my objective in remaining silent I should welcome a return to the matter on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that is not the purpose of my speech; no doubt I would be out of order. I wish to ask why the provisions of clause 34 are confined only to public companies. It is not obvious to me, at least, why the mischief disappears if it is a public company that allows its assets to whittle away. or why the shareholders in a private company are any less in need of protection, or why the creditors of a private company are less likely to look to the company's assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to what was said by the Minister about the size of companies in relation to the requirements which the hon. Gentleman had in mind when drafting his amendment. However. it does not seem to be imposing an undue burden on private companies to ask that the directors should keep an eye on the assets. I note that the obligation in the clause arises
	<br><blockquote><p>"not later than 28 days from the earliest day on which that fact was known to a director"</p></blockquote>
Therefore, one is not asking the directors—not even those of a private company—to perform some sort of feat which is beyond companies with small resources. Of course, not all private companies are necessarily kept within a small family. When I think of the matter, I must add that not every small family is necessarily intra-communicative. I am rather puzzled, therefore, at the necessity for confining these provisions to public companies. Clearly, one advantage of the provisions in clause 34 is that they would make it easier to prove the conditions precedent to an application under section 332 of the 1948 Act which attaches criminal sanctions to neglect of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not make a meal of this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>204</span>
At this stage I am simply asking for information. But I am grateful for the memorandum of the Committee of Scottish Clearing Bankers for drawing attention to the point, and to my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Mr. Roberts) for drawing my attention to this memorandum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had intended to ask the same question of why this was restricted to private companies. It is, perhaps, against my better judgment to ask the question because I wish to relieve private companies of as many burdens as possible, but it seems rather extraordinary that this should have been selected to apply only to public companies. If it is to be of any value, why not apply it to private companies? My view is that it will be of very little value in this context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know how one interprets the purpose of the clause as set out in the first two lines, which read
	<br><blockquote><p>"where the net assets of a public company are half or less of the amount of the company's called-up share capital"—</p></blockquote>
not "are of a value of half or less," but are "in amount". I do not know what that means. Have the directors to make a valuation under that, or do they say that the called-up capital represents so much in money—"We have half of that amount of money in goods"? I do not know how they will make that evaluation under those terms or, indeed, whether they have to make an evaluation at all. It is a valuation which will be made—if I have read clause 34(1) correctly—by the directors' guesswork. They will have to guess whether their assets—I shall assume that this means in value—are less than half the value of the called-up capital in money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directors are not necessarily professional values. In fact, I would say that in most companies—unless one happens to be a company involved in valuation, surveying, assessing or something of that nature—the directors do not know the art of valuing. Therefore, they would merely be guessing at the value and trying to apply—as we discussed during the debate on the last amendment and new clause—some sort of index. If they apply the wrong index or make a wrong guess they may well be committing an offence under subsection
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0116">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>205</span>
(2)—and, apparently, a serious offence. It is putting a very great burden on directors to ask them to spot, in a very short period—not later than 28 days if they have to act—whether the value of the assets of the company drop below this figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rubric of the clause mentions the event of "serious loss of capital" It is not mentioned as such in the clause. The clause merely mentions the figure of the net assets of the company as being half or less of the amount of called-up capital and refers to the situation if the director knows—that should frequently be applied as "ought to know" because, after all, as a director, he ought to know—the value of the company's assets, at which time he has to take action and call a general meeting, and if he does not do so he may be prosecuted under subsection (2). That is a considerable burden on directors and it will be difficult for a prosecution to be brought even in cases of serious default by directors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where I think the clause may be of some use is for the creditors of the company. If the creditors find that directors are being honest with their shareholders and calling a general meeting to tell them that the net assets of the company are as low as stated in the clause, the creditors will have some evidence to suggest that the company is carrying on business with intent to defraud its creditors. Therefore, the advantage of the clause is to provide evidence as a side wind, as it were, to creditors that the company is committing an offence under section 332 of the Companies Act 1948, which is the offence of carrying on business with a view to defrauding creditors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of, first, the difficulties of interpreting the clause and, secondly, the very great burden that it places on honest directors to guess the value of their assets, I must ask why do we need the clause at all. Is not section 332 of the Companies Act 1948 sufficient? There have been prosecutions many times under section 332 for business being carried on with a view to defrauding creditors. Indeed, if directors carry on the business of a company when the assets are at a conspicuously low figure as compared with called-up capital, it is pretty strong evidence either that they
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>206</span>
do not care about their creditors or that they are intending to defraud them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Briefly, therefore, my questions are these. First, how does one interpret half the amount of the called-up capital? Secondly, why do we need the clause at all when there is section 332 of the Companies Act 1948?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the points raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), but I should like to take issue with him on the question of why the clause should apply to private companies. As I said earlier, I feel that we must protect private companies from unnecessary bureaucracy and regaletions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The protection offered by the clause, whose limits my right hon. Friend has outlined rather well, is simply that directors are obliged to call an extra-ordinary general meeting. In a situation in which directors are running the company against the interests, say, of minority shareholders, the fact that they are obliged to call an extraordinary general meeting in a private company will enable them to pass whatever resolution they wish and enable them also to suggest what measures should or should not be taken to deal with the situation, in the language of subsection (1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore do not see that this provision is any protection to minority shareholders in a private company. For that reason, it should be applied only to public companies, if at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also support the anxieties expressed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) but from a slightly different point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where criminal sanctions are to be made available, they should not be imposed lightly. In my opinion, the requirement that puts an equal responsibility on all directors and then, in the event of a criminal prosecution, requires one to prove a negative, seems impracticable no less than unfair. In another part of company law, for example, there is the requirement to deposit an annual return each year with the registrar. Failure to do so is an absolute offence, even if the director has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0117">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>207</span>
posted it himself in a letter-box and it fails to arrive. He is guilty of a criminal offence, and, as a magistrate, I have sat many hours hearing such prosecutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this case we are suggesting a much looser and less satisfactory approach. I should have thought it more sensible from a practical point of view if an individual director was singled out by his office and made responsible for compliance with the provisions of this clause. Whether that director should be the chairman or the chief executive or the finance director is a matter for debate. But if it were the absolute responsibility in law of, say, the chief executive to fulfil the requirements of the clause, later, in the event of a criminal investigation taking place, one would not be in the position of being unable to satisfy oneself in equity whether an offence was committed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a very interesting debate. Perhaps it would be helpful if I first reminded the Committee of the basic purpose here. The objective of the clause is to provide a mechanism whereby shareholders can have an opportunity to consider the position of the company when it runs into difficulty—perhaps very serious difficulty, but before it becomes insolvent and is forced to cease trading. This is relevant to the points raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) about bankruptcy. It is a stage before that dreadful calamity is in the offing. This process may also serve to focus the minds of the management on the company's position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision has been generally welcomed but there has been some pressure to extend it to private companies. That was the point made by the right hon. and learned Member for Warley, West (Mr. Archer). We are aware of the reservations which were expressed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby and my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Baker). We did not want to impose excessive and unreasonable burdens on small companies, which comprise the large bulk of private companies. That reservation is well in our minds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are better and stronger reasons why we should be careful about extending the operation of this clause too soon. This is an innovatory clause. We should
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>208</span>
like to have some real experience of its value and the way it works before deciding whether to extend it to private companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At one stage, my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby said "Why do you not extend it to private companies?"—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say it in that tone. It was merely an inquiry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend asked why it was not extended. He went on to give a great number of practical reasons why a complicated clause of this kind should be allowed to operate in a rather careful way in order to see what kind of practice came from its working.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the hon. Gentleman's reasoning is, in effect, "We are not sure of the value of the clause and we think that it may give rise to some difficulties. We therefore propose to apply it to some companies and not to others" Is that not precisely the reasoning of the level crossing signalman who had his gate half open because he was half expecting a train?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and learned Gentleman could describe it like that if he wished. It was the reasoning and decision of the Government of which he was a member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not the reason; it was the decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fact, they considered this matter, just as we have, and came to approximately the same position as a result of those considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the right hon. and learned Gentleman to accept from the discussion that we have heard this morning that there is good sense in seeing how the clause operates before we consider the possibility of extending it further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the practical questions raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby. The directors know the called-up share capital of the company. They then value the assets to see whether their value exceeds one-half of the called-up capital. My right hon. Friend asked: "Is this guesswork?" No, it is not. Each year the directors of public companies have an obligation to value the assets in their annual accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next, because of the reservations which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0118">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>209</span>
my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Stevens) expressed about the criminal nature of the proposal, I emphasise that, to commit a crime, directors must know of the state of affairs and fail to call a meeting. If the directors did not know, that would be an essential element which would prevent a criminal offence coming into being. It is a question of actual knowledge. If the directors did not know as much about the affairs of the company as is required by the clause, the company would be in a dangerous situation, because the directors were failing to be aware of information which was essential to the well-being of the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With respect to my hon. Friend, I think that the point that he has made has been carefully considered. This is a criminal sanction and it will be construed strictly and in favour of the defendant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the clause is in accordance with a directive so it is a requirement upon us. In the light of the matters covered and the serious underlying condition that would prevail within a company, it is clearly essential that we have a clause of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fears have been expressed about the serious nature of the criminal offence. I believe that there is adequate protection for directors who are doing their duty and there would be no danger of an unreasonable prosecution in a case of this kind. But I believe that it is essential to have such a clause, and a requirement upon directors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also believe strongly that it would be right to limit the provision to public companies at this stage so that we obtain a proper knowledge of its working. It would be wrong to extend such a provision now to the whole range of private companies. We are all aware of the variety and range of private companies. Some are very small indeed, and it would be unreasonable to extend it to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Committee to accept that it is necessary to have a clause in precisely this form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that explanation. I cannot say that I am at all satisfied. He has referred to the directors having knowledge—at least once a year, by
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>210</span>
having to express it in the accounts—of the value of the assets. That occurs once a year. It is true that a good director, familiar with his company's affairs, will keep his finger on the pulse throughout the year. But it is a lot to ask at all times. I say "at all times" because subsection (1) contemplates that a director at all times knows the value of his assets by providing that, within 28 days of his knowing that the net assets are less than half the called-up capital, he has to call a meeting. Therefore, whether he is a working director or an executive director who may attend board meetings only every two months or so but is valuable to the company for the opinions and knowledge that he has, he must know the value of the assets throughout the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This half of the called-up capital may be a marginal matter. If the director applies the wrong index in valuing the assets in his mind, he may be committing an offence under subsection (2). I still think that it is an extraordinarily heavy burden to place on company directors, when they may have no intention of defrauding anyone or of keeping the shareholders in ignorance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate my hon. Friend's description of the clause as a mechanism for giving pre-insolvency information to the shareholders. But, having given that information to the shareholders, what will the directors do when they have called the meeting? Perhaps they have no solution. Apparently, they have then done all that they need do. They need not put anything in front of the shareholders or say anything to the creditors. They can call the meeting and sit silent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause does not say for how long the directors have immunity once they have held the meeting. If they have not cured the value of the assets or managed to increase their value to over one-half of the called-up share capital, what happens then? Are they immune from any action for 12 months, for six months, until the next annual general meeting, or for the next week?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is completely silent on that point but it seems if one reads no more into it, that having called the extraordinary general meeting and told the shareholders the state of the company, the directors are for ever thereafter immune from any proceedings under subsection (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0119">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>211</span>
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is riddled with difficulties. If prosecutions are undertaken, they will be an injustice on some directors. I imagine that no prosecutions will ever be taken under the clause because it is so vague and indeterminate that it would be extremely difficult to prove anything under it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) is making his point convincingly. I wonder whether the clause is an experiment that is worthwhile proceeding with. What I feel about the whole Bill and this clause in particular is that it is a response by the Department to particular situations which have intruded upon it rather than a measure which arises from a thoroughgoing understanding of the present problems of public and private companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It looks to me as though this clause has been worked out because of some special situation in which the Department was criticised or where there was public comment which called for some reform of the law as a result of a scandal or the discomfiture of a company in a particular case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that it is anything like that. Article 17 of the second directive states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the case of a serious loss of the subscribed capital a general meeting of shareholders must be called within the period laid down by the laws of the member States to consider whether the company should be wound up or any other measures taken."</p></blockquote>
That is the only reason for this clause being in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend reminds me of something that I should have recalled, namely, that it is the pressure on the Department that has brought forward this clause. It is not through the press or from the public reacting to a particular set of circumstances but from the Commissioner in Brussels. That is another of the sources of pressure on the Department resulting in Companies Bills being brought before the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a responsibility of Ministers, particularly when they are well informed about business, not simply to respond to outside pressure but to initiate reform of company law. The company law which existed up to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>212</span>
1948 was produced not simply in response to adverse circumstances but following leadership of Members of the House of Commons and others who were familiar with business and who could see what was required. It is now abundantly plain that the whole structure of company law needs reforming. It seems wrong that we should produce tame responses to outside pressures within the Department and not evolve recommendations in the House of Commons which would transform the whole basis of the operation of free enterprise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) for reading out part of Article 17 upon which this clause is based. Perhaps I could emphasise the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the case of a serious loss of the subscribed capital a general meeting of shareholders must be called within the period laid down by the laws of the member States to consider whether the company should be wound up or any other measures taken."</p></blockquote>
That, in part, answers some of the questions that my right hon. Friend raised as to what would happen at this meeting and what should be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive goes on to say that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the amount of a loss deemed to be serious within the meaning of paragraph 1 may not be set by the laws of member States at a figure higher than half the subscribed capital."</p></blockquote>
That is where the reference to "half" comes from in this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one would deny that there was a serious situation when the figure came down below half the subscribed capital. We should all be very concerned if we were connected with a public company that reached that position. There can be no argument about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) expressed concern about the state of companies in this country, and quite rightly. I should have thought that he would welcome a clause of this sort, which causes people to focus their minds on their responsibilities in this type of situation. Therefore, a basic provision in respect of public companies in such a serious situation must be sensible, and I submit that we should keep it very much in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby questioned the knowledge of directors about the value of assets. Of course, he is right to say that directors do not know the precise value of assets every five minutes. However, I must emphasise
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0120">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>213</span>
that, for very practical reasons, the clause is limited to public companies, which are organisations with substantial assets, whose directors are perfectly able to be well advised on such matters. They should be aware that a trend of this sort has developed in the company, and should certainly be prepared to be advised about the value of the assets. The substance of the company would mean that that could happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not imposing an unreasonable burden of responsibility on people in small companies; we are talking about directors of substantial companies. I believe that they should be prepared to undertake that sort of responsibility. If they are not prepared to do that, I am not sure that they are suitable as directors of public companies or for commanding the use of sizeable assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend and my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Stevens) pressed me on the criminal aspect of the matter. I emphasise that under the clause directors are immune for as long as they believe that there continues a state of affairs which does not require action of this sort. Once they have taken the necessary action and brought about the company meeting, they have discharged their responsibilities under the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 34(1) does not require the director to know. It says that if he does know, he must take a certain course of action. So he has to be in a state of knowledge about the matter before he is required to take action. So far, matters are at an entirely reasonable stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the Minister could resolve my indecision on that point. The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) pointed out that there is a doctrine of constructive knowledge. Let us suppose that the director possesses the facts on which he could have arrived at a conclusion but has failed to read them, or something of that sort. Has the hon. Gentleman any advice on the consequences of that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to come back to that point in a few moments, because the right hon. and learned Gentleman raises an important and difficult matter. However, for the moment I should like to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>214</span>
continue with the main approach, concerning the nature of the provision. If a public company with considerable assets gets into a bad state, the directors should certainly be aware of that. There are means within the company of establishing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that all this is entirely reasonable and justifiable. My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby asked "What, then, will they do about it?" The answer in the clause is that the meeting should consider whether the company should be wound up—which would be of considerable importance in preserving the assets if the skids are under the company—or whether any other measures should be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend asks what the directors will do. We are, after all, talking about a private enterprise system in which we expect people to face up to and respond to their problems. The annual general meeting of the company would give them that opportunity. My hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) strongly supports that principle—that directors and other members of companies should be prepared to undertake their responsibilities and to see that the assets are used properly. If there are problems, the company as a whole should face up to them and begin to deal with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I cannot accept that my right hon. Friend is right in demanding that the clause should go further than requiring the calling of a meeting, but I suggest that the calling of this meeting is the very lowest demand we could make of the directors of a public company in this position. There is no danger of them getting into serious criminal trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now deal with the point raised by the right hon. and learned Gentleman. Failure to convene the general meeting has to be knowing and wilful. There is the provision that knowing the position, the directors wilfully do not convene the annual general meeting. I submit, that no serious difficulty can arise out of that aspect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be tiresome, but if what the Minister said is true, it rather disturbs me and I wonder whether we should not add something to the clause. My criticism has not been that the clause imposes too great a burden but that it is not strong enough. I would be a little
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0121">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>215</span>
concerned if a director who did not even bother to read the information that was on his desk could escape liability for that reason.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is difficulty in replying to points raised by members of the Committee in regard to the clause because as one continues with the attempt to explain the nature of the clause, those who have been saying, on a critical basis, "Should you have such a clause?" tend to come round, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman did, to demanding that the clause should be strengthened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never said Should you have the clause?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But I emphasise that the clause is an innovation. All of the points that have been raised by members of the Committee are important, but we shall have to see how the clause works in practice. I advise my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) that it is a requirement of the directive, but justifiable in the circumstances that I have described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also suggest that we cannot necessarily warrant that the clause will be perfect in operation, because it is an innovation. But we are making the right start in this direction by trying to establish a clause which is reasonable. We shall have to see how it works in practice and to see whether a case can then be established for the wider operation of the clause or, perhaps, for its improvement in some material respect. However, I urge that the Committee accepts that there is very good reason and purpose for the provision of a clause such as this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When my hon. Friend says that we shall have to see how the clause works, he is really saying "Let us legislate by litigation and not by Act of Parliament. Leave it to the litigants, prosecutors and directors to write the law for us in front of the judges".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I fear that my hon. Friend has failed to answer two points. The first is whether the constructive knowledge of a director—not the knowledge about the calling of the meeting but the knowledge about the amount of the assets—can be constructive by, for example, all the other directors knowing about it and one poor
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>216</span>
unfortunate director not knowing. Is it a sort of corporate knowledge of the board? In that case there will be the question of the constructive knowledge of directors who do not take the trouble to find out full information about their company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point, which I possibly did not make clear, relates to a meeting having been called at which it was perhaps decided to take some measure other than winding-up, the value of the assets continues at this low figure and the director knows that for several weeks or months after that the measures decided at this general meeting are not effective and that the value of the assets is still low. I had asked how long do all the directors continue with immunity from calling another general meeting. Must they continue to call these general meetings periodically each time that they know that the assets have not improved since they called the first general meeting? The clause says nothing about that, but there should be something in a clause of this kind to tell us for how long the calling of the general meeting relieves the directors of the need again to inform the shareholders of the value of the assets. Should it perhaps be each week or each month?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to harass my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary further on the clause. It would be better to let it go through and see how it works out, although it still seems to have gaps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tried at an early stage to close one of the gaps when I drew attention to the need for the current cost accounting basis of the assessments and value of the capital to be taken into account. I am reinforced in my belief that something along those lines is necessary by the first words of the introduction to the Green Paper on company accounting and disclosure, which read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Reform of the law relating to company accounting and disclosure is overdue"</p></blockquote>
Yet under the clause, directors are to be encouraged to take action on the basis, it seems, of conventional accounting principles, and in my opinion that weakens the clause considerably. However, if a company caught by the proposal in clause 34 were to have an audit committee, that would remedy the situation. I look forward to the Bill being rectified at a later
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0122">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>217</span>
stage, because that will do something to validate this defect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may refer to the two points raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page). Regarding his first query about criminal liability, I must tell him that constructive knowledge does not give rise to liability under the clause. Actual knowledge is required and has to be held by the individual director. I hope that that reassures my right hon. Friend with regard to criminal liability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can the Under-Secretary give as firm an undertaking as that, since surely the definition of "knowledge" in an individual case will be a matter for the courts. He will know the difficulties in a series of cases about the interpretation of "knowledge". Why should it not be "constructive knowledge" in this particular context?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eyre</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite entitled to query the Government's advice, but I must point out to him that the clause was drawn in this way by the previous Government also and was considered then. I am trying to state clearly that the way in which the clause is drawn requires direct, actual knowledge by the individual. That is the most informative and helpful answer I can give the Committee. The hon. Gentleman is entitled to ask, in relation to any advice about Bills of this type, "Are you sure that the legal consequences are precisely as you described?" We are all subject to the test of the courts, ultimately, but it still does not discharge a Minister from the obligation to give advice on the import of the clause in the way that I have done in Committee today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend's second point related to the position once the meeting had been called. The position is that once the meeting has been called the directors are not obliged to call further meetings if the assets do not rise above half the called-up share capital value. That is the specific reply to my right hon. Friend's question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once the meeting has been called and has discussed the matter, the shareholders and others are put on their guard. Calling a meeting of that kind would be like an
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>218</span>
alarm bell sounding. Members of the company would surely then begin to consider whether they should wind up the company. Reasonable directors and shareholders would, in their own interests, act to improve the situation, or wind up the company. I hope that my right hon. Friend will feel that that is an adequate, or at least, a proper answer to his second question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) will agree that this provision for a meeting can cause the members of the company to be aware of the serious situation of the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully understand my hon. Friend's thoughts about the audit committee. When we debate audit committees it will be relevant to relate their possible work to a situation of that sort. I look forward to that discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge my right hon. and hon. Friends to accept that in seeking to reply to their questions we have strengthened the case for the provision of this type of clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) A company which has lawfully acquired any of its own shares may, notwithstanding any provisions of the Companies Acts 1948 to 1979 to the contrary, register these shares in its own name or in that of a nominee".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 199 is a simple amendment to apply the clause only to public companies and not private companies. The clause deals with the acquisition of company shares by the company itself. The clause as it stands prohibits a company, whether private or public, from buying or acquiring its own shares. In that respect it follows articles 18 and 19 of the second directive. Para- graph 1 of article 18 reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The shares of a company may not be subscribed for by the company itself."</p></blockquote>
The article goes on to give certain machinery which comes into play if a company happens to find that it is landed with its own shares by forfeiture or sur- render, or otherwise. It also gives certain exceptions where the company can be permitted to acquire its own shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the second directive applies only to public companies. So far as the Bill applies it any further than to public companies, it is part of our own law and was not forced on us by the EEC. The Committee will remember that under article 1 of the second directive, the directive is applied to types of company in various countries. In the United King- dim it applies to the public company limited by shares, or to the public company limited by guarantee and having a share capital. We can, therefore, break away from the directive in dealing with private companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More than on anything else in this Bill, sources outside the House have raised with me the question of a private company having the power to acquire its own shares. It is desired by those concerned with private companies that that should be permitted under the Bill. So amendment No. 199 simply seeks to restrict the whole of clause 35—the clause prohibiting the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>220</span>
acquisition of shares by the company itself—to public companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 201, which seeks to add a subsection (4), deals with the position of the private company, as to when it acquires its own shares or the mode of acquisition. Obviously there have to be some rules. I have not been so audacious as to try to write the rules into the Bill by a schedule, a long amendment or a new clause. I have used the trick of leaving it to the Secretary of State to write that law in regulations or rules. After all, much of our company law is in rules. All our winding-up procedure is in rules and so on. So there is nothing extraordinary about that. The rules would not need to be very extensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4), therefore, which I would include by means of amendment No. 201, confirms that a private company may buy its own shares, provided that it does so according to the rules of the game laid down by the Secretary of State—and, of course, as I think my hon. Friends would expect from me, laid down as a statutory instrument which requires an affirmative resolution. It would thus have to come before the House of Commons and receive consideration, unlike the negative resolution procedure by which it would be lost in the rest of the statutory instruments passing through the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the present law, a company may acquire its shares. The law is that it must not give consideration for its shares. So if it acquires by way of gift, it has committed no breach of the law. That is why I am puzzled that in clause 35 the word "acquire" should have been used throughout. It has not been qualified by saying that it means acquiring shares for a consideration. Under existing law it can receive its own shares by way of gift and then register them in the name of a nominee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 202 and 203 deal with that matter. The clause in the Bill does nothing about it. It does not repeat the existing law by which a company may acquire shares by gift. It does not even say that if it does acquire them by gift they must be put in the name of a nominee. So I have provided in amendment No. 202 that it is permissible for even a public company to accept a gift of shares, if it pays no consideration for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no reason—this is where I would alter the existing law—why the company should always have to put such shares in the name of a nominee. I should have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0124">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>221</span>
thought it quite in order to leave the company to choose whether it puts the shares in the name of a nominee or holds them in its own name. I have tried to deal with that in amendment No. 203, giving the company the choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 202, 201 and 203 are the minor amendments in this group—the machinery, perhaps. My main amendment No. 199 restricts the clause to public companies and thereby would leave the private company free to acquire its own shares. In many companies, particularly the smaller family companies, the situation frequently arises when it is essential that the company should be able to acquire its own shares, even if only for a limited period. We should leave the private company free to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that we should continue the existing law in respect of public companies. As a general rule, the public company should not acquire its own shares, but that does not need to apply to private companies. It would be extremely harmful to the private company if it were so restricted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You were kind enough, Sir Stephen, to group my amendment No. 234 with those of my right hon. Friend. He has given this matter much greater study than I have and his amendments are admirable. They go beyond mine, but they are in the spirit in which my amendment was intended. This is an important point which should be dealt with at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is another of the "Duke of York's army" clauses in that Parliament is being asked to legislate when we already know that the feeling of the Government is in the opposite direction and in due course we shall be required to tear this out of company law again. Why do we not make the necessary provision now for the Secretary of State, when consultations are completed and a form of words has been found, to give expression to what we all want? Let us do it while the legislation is before us rather than wait for some future date, possibly the Greek calends, when we have another Companies Bill. My right hon. Friend stands an admirable chance here. He has made it easier for the Secretary of State, and I hope that the Minister will not desist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am finding my new role of having to disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) somewhat distasteful. Once again, I am sorry to have to say that, for reasons which we think are good—although I shall not necessarily give them—we advise the Committee not to accept the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) said, the object of his major amendment No. 199 is to remove private companies from the prohibition on acquiring their own shares for cash or consideration. He probably noticed that on Second Reading I made the almost unforgivable mistake for a Minister of becoming enthusiastic about a suggestion on this subject put to me by a Back-Bench Member. I refer to my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton). He and I are both strongly of the view that there is a good case to be made for allowing companies, particularly small companies, to acquire their own shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember when I was in the Whips' Office that one of the problems that all Oppositions have is what subjects should be discussed on Supply days. One wants to choose a subject that is topical and punchy. Ministers or their spokesmen, were always saying "I must have a debate on so-and-so". One would finally say We have a Supply day next week when we shall debate your subject "The answer was always the same: "We are very anxious to debate this subject, but not next week".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is my answer to my hon. Friend. We accept the importance of the principle which he and my right hon. Friend have enunciated. What we say is that we think that it is a matter which should properly be dealt with in the 1980–81 Bill after consultation. The process of consultation is being started, and we shall issue a consultative document, with a view to coming forward with our proposals in 1980–81.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should tell the Committee why I feel that consultation is necessary. First, as my hon. Friends have hinted, this issue has been widely canvassed as a way of helping small companies. There is a strong argument that, if we were to change the law, that might open up small companies to the outside investor, and many are reluctant to put an investment into a small company because they are not sure that they can ever sell their shares or get their money back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0125">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>223</span>
Someone about to start a business might look round for a friend with the necessary cash to spare who is quite happy to put it in that business. For various reasons, it may be necessary for it to be put in on an equity basis. The question that will be asked is "How can I ever be sure of getting my money back? I am totally in the hands of the controlling shareholder". The company cannot buy the shares, and the controlling shareholder quite often has all his money tied up in the business and has no spare cash to buy out the minority shareholding. Therefore, that may dissuade people from investing and putting their savings into small businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the problem of the working director-shareholder who has some shares in the company and who wishes to retire. It would be useful for the company to be able to take his shares off him, the other shareholders might not have funds available, and so on. My hon. Friends know the arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We regard it as a very important argument that such a measure as is proposed might be of help to smaller companies. However, there is another problem. There are other people whose interests have to be considered. First, there are the creditors. We must not forget that they are entitled to protection as well. How does one give a company the right to take such action but only in circumstances which will not give rise to unfairness to the creditors?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend, with a trust in his ministerial friends that I can only welcome, says that he is quite happy to leave it to the Secretary of State—whom we all admire—to come forward with a set of proposals to the House, when we shall all debate them. Is that very different from what I am saying? My right hon. Friend says "Let us devise a set of proposals and bring them to the House, and they will become the rules". I am saying that we shall have consultation, that we shall devise some proposals which will be satisfactory, which will take into account the interests of both the shareholders and the creditors, and which will deal with the thorny problems that could arise from just giving a company the right to reduce its capital. However, we need a bit of time to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend says "Bring your proposals forward". I am simply saying that it is a very complex issue, that we accept the spirit of his amendment and that we think that his proposals would be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>224</span>
better brought forward in the next Bill. That is the difference between us. My right hon. Friend accepts that devising the rules will not be an easy matter, because there are a number of interests to be considered. The courts are involved at the moment. If one wants to reduce one's capital, should we build the courts into the provision and say that, because it is an important matter, those who wish to pursue it should go to the courts as they have to do now?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should the principle of redeemable preference shares be used, when a company has to set aside a sum equal to the value of the shares redeemed in a capital redemption account which is not available for distribution to the shareholders to ensure that its capital is maintained? Once again, creditors are protected by ensuring that sufficient capital is maintained for the company to carry out the activities that its memorandum and articles give it the right to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are not arguments that I put forward because I think "This is a novel proposal from the Back Benches and Governments must get all the credit for coming forward with suggestions that bring about worthwhile changes in company law". That is not our attitude. I hope that my hon Friends will feel from my replies to amendments Nos. 199, 200 and 201 that I have a great deal of sympathy for the principle. We shall be consulting and coming forward in the 1980–81 Bill with our own proposals in this regard. I hope that my right hon. Friend will find those satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to amendments Nos. 202 and 203. As my right hon. Friend said, Amendment No. 202 permits a company to accept a gift of its own shares in its own name, provided that it gives no consideration. Amendment No. 203 permits a company which has lawfully acquired any of its own shares to register those shares in its own name or that of a nominee. My right hon. Friend said that in the Re Castilians Wills Trust case it was held that under present laws a company could accept a gift, but it must register the shares in the names of nominees. The reason that that arrangement was necessary was not due to anything required by statute but is a principle established in common law. Therefore, in amendment No. 203 the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"not withstanding any provisions of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0126">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>225</span>
Companies Acts 1948 to 1979 to the contrary"</p></blockquote>
seem to be redundant. This is not, in fact, a principle embodied in statute, but it is embodied in common law. We are not concerned with statutory prohibitions but with common law rules. My right hon. Friend will accept that, to that extent, his proposals are defective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the two amendments achieve, therefore, is very limited. They represent no change in the substance of the position under the Bill. They simply permit a company to hold shares in its own name instead of in the name of nominees. There is not a big issue between us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have any strong views on the issue but, equally, I do not believe in change for the sake of change. If "A" Limited is given a block of shares by some slightly eccentric and well-meaning shareholder who wants to show gratitude to the company by giving it a present, I am not sure whether anybody will be wiser or better off if those shares appear in the register of "A" Limited in the name of "A" Limited or in the name of nominees holding them on behalf of "A" Limited. It could be confusing for some people to find that a company is registered as the holder of some of its shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I do not think that it is a very big or important point. Nobody has established that much is to be gained from letting the company register in its own name instead of in those of nominees. In the circumstances, I wonder whether my right hon. Friend believes it is worth making a change which achieves so little.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not normally rise to come to the assistance of the right hon. Gentleman—he does not normally require any assistance—but I intervene from a position of childlike innocence to inquire what is the argument for exempting private companies from the requirement that normally the company shall not be able to acquire its own shares—however convenient that might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the intention is to prevent the mischief of the accumulation of nominal capital unsupported by genuine assets. The danger is that a company will issue its shares in return for assets. It will then issue further shares which it pays for with the same assets. Therefore, anyone dealing with the company will look at the nominal number of shares issued and will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>226</span>
be misled as to the actual assets possessed by that company. It is one example of a fairly well known fraudulent device of making the same money appear simultaneously in a number of different places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances I cannot see why the distinction between a large and a small company is relevant. I can, of course, understand the reasoning that it should not apply to a company acquiring its own shares without giving consideration. Quite clearly there the danger does not apply. But I cannot understand why it matters that the company with which one is dealing is a small company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand that the distinction between a large and a small company, or between a public and a private company, is relevant if we are considering how many administrative burdens to lay upon the company. We are all anxious to avoid, where we can, laying upon small companies, or private companies generally, any unnecessary administrative burdens. But I confess that, for the life of me, I cannot understand the relevance of a company being a small or a private company when we are endeavouring to ensure that its nominal capital is not misleading as to the actual assets in its hands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that point, it is a great advantage for a small private company that it may be possible to attract investment when the investor knows that, as a last resort, the company can acquire his shares. This frequently applies on the death of substantial shareholders in, for example, a family company. It is perhaps impossible to dispose of those shares except by the company itself taking them over for a time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many examples to show that a private company will benefit by being allowed to acquire its own shares. Indeed, there is no reason why they should be unsupported by assets. My hon. Friend mentioned what is done with redeemable preference shares, but in that case one must have the capital to back them. A similar rule could apply to the acquisition by a private company of its own shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal with amendments Nos. 202 and 203. I do not much mind about amendment No. 203, which seeks to give a company the option to register shares of its own that it acquires in its own name or in that of a nominee. There is no
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0127">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>227</span>
reason why it should not be obliged to hold them in the name of a nominee if that is the existing law. I should have thought it would be clearer to anyone searching the file of the company if it were seen that those shares were held by the company itself and not by a nominee who may be completely unknown to the person examining the file or any other shareholder. One so frequently sees nowadays the names of nominees on the files of companies—particularly the strange nominee that has appeared from Talisman, Stepson, all down the register of companies, as well as various other Talisman nominees—that one wonders whether any name on the companies register is a true name. It would be far clearer if my hon. Friend accepted amendment No. 203.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my right hon. Friend accept my argument that the amendment is defective because the provisions are not within the Companies Acts but it is a common law rule established by case law? If we accepted it, the amendment would not be particularly sensible—very surprisingly, if I may say so; indeed, I imagine uniquely for an amendment tabled by my right hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not a fault of the amendment. If I am stating the common law with a view to codifying and consolidating it within legislation, I am doing exactly the right thing. If I have stated the common law correctly, I am very pleased. It is no fault in the amendment to be a statement of common law. When we are legislating in company law, let us collect in all the company law, so that the practitioner is not left searching in the law reports and missing the point. He is very likely to miss the point that I have tried to make in amendment No. 202—that a company can acquire its own shares by way of gift. That is the law at present. Yet the clause may exclude that law. For one thing, it uses throughout the word "acquire", not "purchase for a consideration". I should have thought that the word "acquire" applied equally to buying and to receiving by way of gift. Surely if a company receives shares by way of gift, it acquires those shares. That is why I say that the clause as it stands in the Bill as printed alters the common law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>228</span>
I have tried to restore the common law rule by the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the clause does more than that to exclude the common law rule. In subsection (3), three cases are set out in which the prohibition upon a company acquiring its own shares does not apply. They are set out clearly—(	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>). Surely the inclusion of those cases excludes any others. I shall refrain from using the Latin phrase, but simply say that if one sets out a list of things and says "These shall be the exemptions", surely that means that there shall be no other exemptions. As my hon. Friend has said, one then searches in the law reports to find a few more exemptions. They must not be included in the Bill, they must not be made clear to the practitioner, and a complete list must not be made. The rest must be left to the law outside legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely it is wise to complete the list, and not to leave doubt as to whether there is the intention of excluding part of the existing law by the way in which clause 35 is drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the general principle of clause 35, my hon. Friend said that a good case could be made for legislation to enable small companies to acquire their own shares. But, as has been said to me in so many cases when I have presented Private Member's Bills: "Not now, and not you". That is all there is to it."Oh, yes", says my hon. Friend, "we are going to bring it in due course. But we, the Government, will bring it in and we, the Government, will not bring it in now".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I am quite correct, therefore, in saying that my hon. Friend's answer to me is Not now, and not you ". The time may be 1980 or 1981, if there is then legislative room for another Companies Bill, which I doubt. I am sure that we shall reach 1980 or 1981 and be told that there is no room for a further Companies Bill. My hon. Friend shakes his head, but he may be promoted to another Department. He may become a Secretary of State, the Home Secretary or the head of any other Department, and we shall have someone who does not feel that he has given the firm undertaking that my hon. Friend has given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend says that there must be consultation about this. That is exactly what the amendment allows. He can continue the consultation in order to draft the right rules for the private company. So I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0128">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>229</span>
have taken into account every promise that he has made and given him good room to be flexible over the rules that he may lay down for private companies to acquire their own shares. It would be wise of him to accept the principle of the amendments as laid down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have gone through this Committee stage so far without a Division. I think it is very boring when one has a Committee stage without Divisions. I shall not ask leave of the Committee to withdraw my amendment No. 199. I. wish it to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very briefly, my hon. Friend's reply to my right hon. Friend has amounted to this: that there is no time like the future. But I would like to remind him of a Prime Minister's slogan: "If not me, who? If not now, when?" My right hon. Friend's amendment No. 201 will merely enable the Minister to hold consultations and to come forward with recommendations to Parliament before we reach the next Companies Bill, whenever that may be. I think that my right hon. Friend is right. If he asks the Committee to divide, I shall support him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like first to deal with the point raised by the right hon. and learned Member for Warley, West (Mr. Archer) about the difference between small and large companies. One of the basic differences is that, on the whole, people who hold shares in large companies have a market for them, and they are not locked into them. They can get rid of their shareholding quite easily if they wish to, because there is usually a market in the shares of a company of any consequence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, with a smaller company people can often find themselves locked in. We think that that may be acting as a barrier to investment in those small businesses which both sides of the House of Commons look to as future sources of employment for the country. That is one of the principal reasons why there are grounds for distinguishing between the two on the basis of size, and why there is that difference between the large and small company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other reasons. Larger companies might use the provision as a way of protecting themselves against takeovers, and so on. There are different circumstances. There is a case, as has
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>230</span>
happened in other countries, for companies of both sizes to have the right to buy back their own shares.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that there are circumstances relating to small companies when it would be convenient if the company could acquire its own shares. I was questioning why the mischief of the rule should not apply to small companies. I think that the hon. Gentleman said earlier that one has to protect not only shareholders but those who deal with the company. Why should they be misled about the assets available to a small company?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly why I believe that it will not be a quick and easy job to draft a set of rules. The argument between my right hon. Friend and myself boils down to whether we act through delegated legislation—in other words, do we come forward with a set of rules—or in the framework of the next Companies Bill. In fact, it would be quite possible for us to come forward much later with a set of rules, long after the next Companies Bill was on the statute book. My right hon. Friend may well then find that he has frustrated himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is not a great difference between us. We accept that it is an innovation which could well be necessary. I have tried to suggest some of the difficulties that exist and some of the problems that will have to be dealt with. My right hon. Friend makes the matter sound very simple: "Oh, just draw up a set of rules and bring them to the House".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have thought of my right hon. Friend not as someone who sought glory but as one who has earned his reputation in Parliament as a man who worked on statutory instruments, and so on, for years and years to ensure that the House of Commons did a magnificent job. I never thought that he was a glory seeker. However, he has said this morning "It is not good enough. The Minister wants the credit".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether we can find a. way of writing into the next Bill something that we shall call the Page clause. I am very flattered to know that my right hon. Friend feels that I might be promoted. There is, of course, another way to go. That is constantly in the mind of Ministers. It is possible that I shall not hold this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0129">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>231</span>
office when the time comes. However, I have a shrewd suspicion that I shall, and I give my right hon. Friend the assurance that when I rise to speak to that clause on Second Reading of the next Bill, I shall make it quite clear that he was the moving spirit behind it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
