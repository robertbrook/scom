	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 12, in page 3, line 39, at end insert
	<br><q><p>'except that in the case of a code issued by the Service under section 6 of the 1975 Act or having effect by virtue of paragraph 4 of Schedule 17 to that Act the Secretary of State shall not proceed unless he has obtained the consent of the Service'.</p></q>
May I extend to you, Mr. Leadbitter, a warm welcome to our exciting proceedings on this important Bill. I hope that your presence does not mean that Mr. Goodhew is indisposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have repeatedly expressed our belief that the decision in 1974 to establish an Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service and that the Government—and the Secretary of State in particular—should not be over-involved in the day-to-day management of industrial relations is something to which we attach great importance, and that is reflected in this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1975 Act gave the Service the power to make codes of practice, subject to the approval of both Houses of Parliament. This clause would give the Secretary of State additionally a similar power. We believe, for all the reasons that we have advanced previously, that the Service is still the right body to produce codes of practice. We have reaffirmed that, and we shall no doubt do so again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By subsection (7), to which the amendment applies, not only is the Secretary of State given the power together with ACAS to produce codes of practice but also, where there is an existing code of practice on which there may be conflict, where the Secretary of State may be in conflict with the Service, the Secretary of State's code shall supersede or have priority over that produced by the Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>266</span>
We regard that as a daft state of affairs. When the power is exercised—presumably, it is intended that it should be exercised, since otherwise there is no point in having it there—it will bring the Secretary of State into conflict with the Service. That will not only be detrimental to the standing and morale of the Service but be bad for industrial relations, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, perhaps the Under-Secretary will say something about the resources of experience and expertise in this field that may or may not be available to the Secretary of State to guide him when producing his code or codes of practice. My recollection is that most of the people in the Department of Employment who had a great deal of ability and expertise in this work were transferred, rightly and understandably, to the staff of ACAS. Although there are one or two officials still in the Department with a role in the industrial relations field, I should have thought that their number was limited and that the majority were on the staff of ACAS and not available to the Secretary of State, by virtue of the statute that established the independence of ACAS and notwithstanding that they continue to be civil servants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to the main point, the conflict that may well arise between the Secretary of State and the Service and the effect of that on the morale of the Service. In the circumstances hypothesised in this subsection, for the Secretary of State to produce a code that overrides or sets aside a code produced by ACAS is, in effect, a vote of no confidence. He is saying that he thinks better than the Service, that the Service somehow has misjudged or misunderstood or, for political or whatever reasons has produced a code in which he has no confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One is bound to ask also about the effect on industrial relations of what would be two conflicting codes of practice, one produced by ACAS and presumably urged on both sides of industry by the Service as showing the right course and right practices to follow, and the other produced by the Secretary of State saying, in effect, that the earlier one is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People in industry who look to ACAS may well find themselves in considerable difficulty, as may the conciliation staff of ACAS, one of whose tasks is to encourage
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0646">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>267</span>
the use of the procedures, principles and measures set out in a particular code. For them to have to change course may result not only in confusion and lack of confidence in the Service but in difficulty for those involved in the day-to-day conduct and management of industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main question is that of the conflict, which we seek to eliminate. No doubt, my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) will refer to amendment No. 13, which Mr. Goodhew chose not to select for debate. My hon. Friend was convinced that the weakness of my amendment was that it was a direct negative. I am sure that if it had been it would not have been called for debate. It is not a direct negative. The words that we do not like give the Secretary of State power to produce codes of practice. Codes of practice are a useful tool in industrial relations, but such codes should be produced by those with a much closer involvement and more day-to-day experience than the Secretary of State is likely to have had.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More important is that if the council of ACAS is made up of representatives of both sides of industry who feel an obligation to ensure the effective implementation of whatever they are recommending, there is much greater likelihood of acceptance and implementation of a code of practice—clearly they will urge it on those whom they represent—than if such a code were seen to be imposed by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Notwithstanding our reservations about the clause as a whole and the powers which it gives to the Secretary of State, and our equally strong reservations about the specific power under subsection (7), if this is subsequently to become part of an Act of Parliament, in order to avoid conflict and all the consequences that I have described the very least that should happen is that the Secretary of State should go along to ACAS. He may be able to persuade it that it had the thing wrong and he has it right. ACAS may well say "Yes, the Secretary of State has something. Perhaps we did not understand or give it sufficient consideration." He may persuade ACAS that he has a case. We say that he should be required to go along and persuade it of his case and not proceed further himself unless ACAS thinks that it is a sensible thing to do and that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>268</span>
it will be beneficial rather than detrimental to industrial relations generally. It makes good sense to require the Secretary of State to obtain the consent of the Service before proceeding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) for his kind remarks earlier and for his reference to the Chairman, Mr. Victor Goodhew. I am glad to say that he is on the way to recovery. He is unwell but we hope to see him back here shortly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick Meyhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) has raised various anxieties and doubts about the provisions of clause 2, and he is seeking to exclude the Secretary of State from exercising his power to issue a code under the clause in respect of any matter which is already the subject of an ACAS code or in respect of which ACAS has a statutory duty to issue a code. It is, perhaps, helpful if we remind ourselves of the sources of the powers and the duties conferred upon ACAS to issue codes of practice itself. They are to be found in section 6 of the Employment Protection Act 1975.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
ACAS has power to give such practical guidance as it thinks fit by way of a code for the purposes of promoting the improvement of industrial relations. As to its duties, there is imposed upon ACAS the particular duty to give practical guidance by code of practice in relation to disclosure of information and, second, time off to be permitted by an employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important point for the Comittee to note is that an ACAS code cannot be laid before Parliament without the approval of the Secretary of State. Even with Parliament's approval, ACAS may only issue a code as a draft. It does not come into effect until such day as the Secretary of State may appoint. It is to the Secretary of State, therefore, that the 1975 Act expressly looks for the approval of even a code drawn up by ACAS in the first place, thereafter to Parliament for approval, and thereafter once again to the Secretary of State for bringing it into effect and investing it with the influence which the Act stipulates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The implementation of an ACAS code, therefore, made in pursuance of its powers is effectively subordinated to the Secretary
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0647">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>269</span>
of State in the way that I have indicated. The amendment moved by the right hon. Gentleman can thus be seen to conflict with that distribution of responsibility. I wish to make clear that the Government set great store by the jurisdiction given to ACAS to issue practical guidance. They attach great value to that and to the code-making powers of ACAS, and they envisage that by far the majority of any codes to be produced for industrial relations purposes in future will be produced by ACAS. The reason for that value is primarily that the representative structure of ACAS affords it wide experience of industrial relations so that the guidance that it can offer in a code of practice can be expected to be practical, as the Act itself requires that it shall be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government would not intend to produce, through the Secretary of State, a new or a revised code unless they were convinced that this was clearly necessary and that it could not be done by ACAS. Of course, the right hon. Gentleman raises the question of the circumstances in which this might arise. We believe that it might well arise where an issue of contested policy flavours a straight issue of industrial relations—for example, the application of the closed shop to the freedom of the press. Here, the representative structure of ACAS may result in a sharp difference of opinion within the council between those nominated by the TUC perhaps and those nominated by the CBI, which may prevent it from agreeing to produce or revise a code. The same may be said of the closed shop in other circumstances and, as the Government have already made plain, it is their intention to introduce a code to deal with the institution and the implementation of a closed shop agreement, drawing upon the best practice of the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On picketing, the Government have said that they hope that voluntary guidelines can be established. They would prefer that a code should be drawn up voluntarily setting out the law relating to picketing and dealing also with the proper practice of conducting a picket line. They have also said that if voluntary agreement cannot be achieved they intend themselves to produce a code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>270</span>
We believe that this is a field in which the drafting and issuing of a code of practice is properly the function of my right hon Friend the Secretary of State and not that of ACAS. It must be right that in such circumstances the Secretary of State should be able to issue the practical guidance and advice which he considers appropriate and necessary at any give time in respect of matters for which, after all, he is responsible to Parliament. It must be right for him not to be trammel in this jurisdiction by the provisions that the amendment would impose on him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the hon. and learned Gentleman, if he wishes to discuss codes of practice dealing with picketing or press freedom, we shall happily do that. I was looking forward to doing that at a later stage in our proceedings, and what the hon. and learned Gentleman has just said does not deal with the subject of the amendment at all. The amendment deals not with codes which may be produced by the Secretary of State because ACAS, by its nature, may be reluctant or unable to produce them—for example, codes relating to press freedom—but with situations where a code has already been issued by ACAS under section 6 of the 1975 Act, and the Secretary of State for reasons of his own, which we have not heard yet, wants to set aside either the whole or part of that ACAS code in favour of a code produced by himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With respect, while the hon. and learned Gentleman said a lot of interesting things about how and why the Government intend to produce codes, he has not so far addressed himself to what the amendment aims at.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon Gentleman's amendment is perfectly correct. It would prevent the Secretary of State from proceeding unless he had
	<br><q><p>"obtained the consent of the Service".</p></q>
It would add to subsection (7) the words:
	<br><q><p>"except that in the case of a code issued by the Service under section 6 of the 1975 Act or having effect by virtue of paragraph 4 of Schedule 17 to that Act the Secretary of State shall not proceed unless he has obtained the consent of the Service".</p></q>
That is perfectly correct. But to trammel the jurisdiction of the Secretary of State in this way is to conflict with the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0648">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>271</span>
pattern of the 1975 Act which has subordinated to the approval of the Secretary of State the power of ACAS to issue codes of practice for the purposes set out in section 6. It has similarly subordinated the power to bring the code of practice into effect unless the Secretary of State has first fixed the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have sought to show why the Government believe that the Secretary of State should have the power which is given in subsection (7) and why it is not appropriate in every case that a code of practice should be produced by ACAS for the purposes that clause 2 in every case sets out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has a responsibility to Parliament, for example, in respect of the closed shop. He has a responsibility to Parliament in respect of picketing. We believe that it is right that he should have the power to issue a code of practice in the case of those two matters, for example, because it is easily to be envisaged that ACAS might well be precluded for the reasons I have mentioned from either agreeing upon the contents of a code of practice or even from drawing up a code of practice itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe, therefore, that it must be right that this power should lie with the Secretary of State. But there is no ground for fear that ACAS will be disregarded, or that its code, if any is already in existence, will be automatically superseded, because under subsection (2) and (6) the Secretary of State has to consult and any inadvertent conflict can be avoided. He has to consult with ACAS. He is required to do that before he can even prepare a draft. If he received opinions on a proposed supersession, of course he would take those into account, and any draft code that he introduced would be subject to the approval of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman said that a conflict here would be bad for the morale of ACAS. I do not think that that is established, because the circumstances in which it is envisaged that the Secretary of State will issue a code are likely to be those where ACAS is unwilling itself to introduce a code of its own. The provisions for consultation that I have referred to will, in all foreseeable circumstances, be sufficient to ensure that there is no adverse effect upon the moral of ACAS, which is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>272</span>
the last thing that this Government would want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman asked me what were the resources available to the Secretary of State for drawing up a code of practice. He said that many experienced staff—this is indeed the case—had been transferred from the Department of Employment to ACAS when ACAS was set up. There is no intention to draw up numerous codes. ACAS is largely staffed by Department of Employment civil servants and mobility between ACAS and the Department of Employment will continue. The consultation that I have already referred to, which is the duty of the Secretary of State, will ensure that sufficient expertise in the matters which I have referred to will be available to the Secretary of State for this purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is certainly, I hope this is clear from what I have already said—not capable of being seen as a vote of no confidence in ACAS. The Government have the greatest confidence in ACAS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest to the hon. and learned Gentleman referring to the role of ACAS and the role of the present Government and his belief that the last thing the Government want to do is to destroy or in any way undermine the role of ACAS. Is the hon. and learned Gentleman not confusing the Government with his right hon. Friend the present holder of the office of Secretary of State, who is a noted dove in these matters and who obviously has the reputation of wanting to maintain ACAS?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely, the hon. and learned Gentleman will accept that in the event of a Cabinet reshuffle, which is always likely to come about—in fact, it could come about in the very future, given what is happening to this Government—his right hon. Friend may be removed and one of the hardliners in the Cabinet may replace him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument that the hon. and learned Gentlemen is now pursuing would not necessarily follow with one of his hardline colleagues in that position. The careful adifice that he has built up in response to my right hon. Friend's first-class argument this morning would collapse in a heap of dust and, without our amendment, would be of no avail. He should think again and recognise that there are often changes within a Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0649">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>273</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not assume that the Conservative Party is as fissiparous as is the party one section of which he represents for the moment. Any Government would wish to be able to offer practical guidance, to use the words of the 1975 Act, to all who may be concerned with the institution and operation of a closed shop. Similarly, it must be conceded even by the hon. Gentleman, that there is a longfelt need for practical guidance to be afforded to those who are affected by picketing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must draw to the hon. and learned Gentleman's attention yet again that in this amendment we are not seeking to deprive the Secretary of State of the power to make such codes as he has previously mentioned. That is not what is dealt with. I think it deplorable that the Secretary of State may be seeking the power to do that, but that is not what we are discussing. We are not talking about situations where the Service refuses or is reluctant to produce a particular code that the Secretary of State may think is desirable on the closed shop, picketing or the press. The amendment refers to situations where ACAS produces a code under its own power and then the Secretary of State wants to produce yet another and different code and set aside the ACAS code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no good the hon. and learned Gentleman giving us bland assurances that the Secretary of State is under a statutory obligation to consult, and he would not want to put himself in a situation of conflict. If all that were true, there would be no need for subsection (7). If that is the case, he ought to accept not only my amendment but that tabled by, my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow Mr. Mikardo and say that it is redundant. Presumably, it is put there in anticipation of precisely such a conflict, and it is wrong to say that in such a situation the Secretary of State shall be supreme and shall override ACAS. The hon. and learned Gentleman is not addressing himself to that. It is true that under the 1975 Act the ACAS codes of practice have to be submitted to the Secretary of State for his approval. I am sure that the officials in the Department will confirm for the hon. and learned Gentleman that when I, as Minister responsible on behalf of the then Secretary of State,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>274</span>
had the responsibility to vet draft codes of practice prepared by ACAS, it was unthinkable to me that, notwithstanding that power, I should alter a code prepared by ACAS. First, to do so would be a monstrous vote of no confidence in ACAS. Second, it would be arrogant on my part to think that I, as Minister of State, in my room in St. James's Square then—or now Caxton House—know better than the representatives of the TUC and CBI.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has that long-stop power, but to use it is almost unthinkable. It is something to be reserved for rare occasions. I make no complaint against the hon. and learned Gentleman, because he has not yet had that experience of dealing with the making of codes of practice. But he will find himself in that situation, and that is what needs to be taken into account. It is not enough to assure us that really there is not a world of difference between what he is proposing in the Bill as it stands and the present practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the right hon. Gentleman says, but where it is thought right for the Secretary of State to have jurisdiction to issue a code from the arguments advanced by the right hon. Gentleman is that throughout the many months of consultation and discussion on the provisions of the Bill, including the period since publication and Second Reading, neither the TUC nor the CBI, nor ACAS or any other body has intimated that it sees difficulties in this proposal. Therefore, I believe that it must be right for the amendment to be rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. and learned Gentleman suggesting—this was implicit in his closing remark—that somehow the TUC was content with clause 2 as it stands?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No expression of particular difficulty or fear or anxiety regarding this provision has been made to the Government, to the best of my knowledge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then I must challenge the hon. and learned Gentleman right away. Not only on this but on many other matters in the Bill, he must not take silence for assent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a great irony about the whole of the proceedings of the Committee. We seem to see unfolding a serial story of a supposedly noninterventionist Government demanding more and more power for the Secretary of State. This has been at the root of all the disagreement so far. While the Government demand more and more power for the Secretary of State, they resist every attempt that we make to take the sensitive area of industrial relations out of the political arena and into the hands of experienced people in industry who have a genuine vested interest in finding solutions and reaching agreements. I find this ironic when we are supposedly dealing with a Government with a noninterventionist philosophy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members of Parliament, with the notable exception of the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst), usually make polite noises, to say the least, about ACAS. Some of them go even further and say that ACAS is "a good thing". Yet they never translate those views into practice when they come to vote on our amendments. At every stage they oppose every amendment which recognises the value of ACAS, which recognises its independence, experience and expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary emphasised that even now any ACAS-produced code of practice requires approval of the Secretary of State. We understand that. It has also been pointed out that any codes produced by the Secretary of State himself will have to be laid before Parliament, as ACAS codes are now. The essential difference is the initiative. The initiative at the moment lies with ACAS. There is quite a difference in transferring that initiative to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that even the most fervent champion of our parliamentary democracy would claim that Parliament as an institution is an expert on industrial relations. I certainly would not accept that the Secretary of State as an institution is an expert on industrial relations, either. Anything which takes the initiating role away, or even partly takes it away, from the people who are the experts is clearly a backward step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In opposing our amendment, the Under-Secretary said that ACAS may
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>276</span>
find itself in certain circumstances unable to agree on a code, and he referred to the possibility of its being unable to agree on a code concerning the freedom of the press. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) pointed out, the amendment does not cover that situation and what the Under-Secretary said was totally irrelevant to it. Clearly, if ACAS, after careful deliberation, is unable to agree on a code, I do not think that we should object to the Secretary of State then taking on the responsibility. But the circumstances in which ACAS failed to agree would be very rare, and at least it should be given the opportunity. If we need a code about the freedom of the press—I shall have a good deal to say about that later, if I am fortunate enough to catch your eye, Mr. Leadbitter—ACAS ought at least to be given the opportunity, and it must not be assumed by the Under-Secretary that its members would be unable to agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The further we move into the proceedings of the Committee, the further we expose the vast difference of philosophy between the two parties. The present Government's desire is to gather to themselves almost total power not merely to influence but to control industrial relations. They seem to have learnt little from their previous Industrial Relations Act which proved such a disaster. There have been times when Ministers have said that they have learnt that lesson, but I am beginning to wonder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we go further into the Bill, I fear that we shall get more and more into difficulty of this kind, and I hope that the Government, even now, will have the good sense to hold back a little and accept that the real key to successful industrial relations lies outside the Department of Employment. It lies outside the political arena entirely. It rests with those whose day-to-day job is in industry and whose livelihood depends in the long run on getting a satisfactory agreement between the varying sides of industry. When the Under-Secretary of State says that, in his view, the terms of the Bill as it stands are not a vote of no confidence in ACAS, I accept that, but his rejection of our amendment is certainly not a vote of confidence in ACAS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

see that the Cabinet reshuffle has not yet taken place. We read all sorts of scarifying stories in the press at the end of last week, but I was pleased to read in the weekend press that the horrors in store for the Secretary of State never transpired. He has left the Committee for a few moments, but he looked hale and hearty and we are pleased to see that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are worried about is the general tenor of the proceedings, which seems to have changed. The Under-Secretary of State mentioned several times the extra powers to be given to the Secretary of State, and placed great emphasis on his jurisdiction. I think I heard him mention powers to supersede codes which ACAS had already produced. I should be worried about that, because I did the Secretary of State the compliment of reading his Second Reading speech and noted that he said at the beginning that he approached the whole subject with some humility and a desire for consensus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consensus, I hope, is what we ought to look for, but we appear to be moving away from it. If I heard the Under Secretary correctly, he talked about the right to have power to supersede what has been done so far and to set aside existing codes. As I understand it, we have three codes already: one on disciplinary practice and procedures in employment; one on disclosure of information to trade unions for collective bargaining purposes; and one on time off for trade union duties and activities. I hope that we can have assurances that there is no intention to set aside any of those provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>278</span>
The Secretary of State said on Second Reading:
	<br><q><p>"I have had to give, and must continue to give, top priority to the true independence of ACAS which I believe to be of incredible value to this country."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 December 1979; Vol. 976, c. 69.]</p></q>
The Secretary of State referred to the "incredible value" of ACAS, yet all I have heard today sounds like a devaluation of ACAS that the Secretary of State must not be entrammelled, that all power must be given to the Secretary of State and that we must not pay so much attention to ACAS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary even led us to suppose that the TUC was quite happy. That is just not true. It issued us with a booklet, which all hon. Gentlemen have, in which it said:
	<br><q><p>"Such codes, with semi-legal status, could place further restrictions on unions in addition to the contents of the Bill."</p></q>
That is not giving a fair wind to the clause. The last sentence of the TUC's comments on clause 2 is:
	<br><q><p>"Such a provision would be very disruptive of industrial relations."</p></q>
So it is not right for the Under-Secretary to suggest that the TUC is in favour. It is not. We suggest in our amendment that he should proceed precisely in the way that the Secretary of State suggested on Second Reading by consensus, by agreement, and, as we put it here, with the consent of ACAS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's last few words confounded me. He said that because there had been no representations by the TUC, the CBI and so on about the clause as at present drafted, there appeared to be no case for amending it. I find that doctrine remarkable. I know that it is not done to talk about other Bills before the House, but I remind the hon. and learned Gentleman that there have been, for instance on the Education (No. 2) Bill, massive representations, particularly about the clause relating to school transport. But, despite the massive representations, the Government have not yet accepted the point made by those affected by the clause on school transport in that Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. and learned Gentleman pursues that doctrine, he and his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will receive
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0652">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>279</span>
massive representations on almost every aspect of this Bill, not only from the TUC but from its affiliated unions, branches and trades councils throughout the length and breadth of Great Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will have seen, as will the Under-Secretary, the TUC commentary on the Bill which refers specifically to clause 2 in these terms and reads:
	<br><q><p>"Such codes, with semi-legal status, could place further restrictions on unions in addition to the contents of the Bill. A code on union membership agreements may well include a proposal contained in the original working paper, whereby union membership agreements become subject to review."</p></q>
That, of course, is provided for in the Bill.
	<br><q><p>"Such a provision would be very disruptive of industrial relations."</p></q>
It is clear from the TUC's comments that it is decidedly unhappy with this aspect of the Bill</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Perhaps I have been remiss in that, whilst I have ensured that all his hon. Friends behind him have a copy of this excellent document from the TUC—"TUC Commentary on The Employment Bill"—I may have overlooked the fact that the Minister did not get one. I assure him that I shall repair that omission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He has one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted. Then perhaps he will spend a little time reading what the TUC has to say about the Bill. I am sure that I am not exaggerating when I say that the general trade union attitude to this misnamed Employment Bill—which as we all know is the Industrial Relations Act, Mark 2—is that the sooner this Bill is burnt the better it will be for industrial relations. I hope that as we go through the rest of the Bill the Minister will not return to the theme that, because someone has not made representations, we can all take it that the wording of the Bill is correct, in order and acceptable to everybody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But that is only a minor aspect. The trouble is that the Minister simply did not listen to my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker). He did not understand his remarks or, if he understood, he willfully misrepresented the case
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>280</span>
that my right hon. Friend put forward on the necessity for agreement. If we have a situation where the Secretary of State overrules—which is what it would amount to codes of practice issued by ACAS, that would be not only a vote of no confidence in ACAS but also a signal to the trade union movement that the word of ACAS no longer applies but what applies is the diktat from the Department of Employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I accept that the present holders of the various offices in the Department are doves within the Tory Party—most of them, including the hon. and learned Gentleman, have a good record as honourable men who do their best to understand the industrial relations problems facing this country—even they know that they are a minority at present within the Tory Party, and there is a widespread feeling in the Tory Party that if only it could get rid of the present holders of office and get some real Tories into office that would go a long way towards solving the problems that afflict us today. We on the Opposition side know that that is nonsense and it would be a terrible tragedy for this country if some of the hard men were appointed to the Department of Employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why it is vital that we try to get the Bill right. We are charged with a duty by Parliament. We must try to ensure—without a great deal of help so far from hon. Members on the Government side, though I am sure that they will assist us later—that a Bill which is worthwhile and in the interests of industrial relations emerges from Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has referred to codes of practice on picketing and on secondary action. We are in some difficulty here, on two counts. There are later clauses which deal specifically with those two matters, but, even more importantly, according to the Prime Minister on Thursday last at Question Time, in reply to my right hon, Friend the Leader of the Opposition, we are to have new clauses which will be debated on the Floor of the House in relation to these two extremely important matters. While I appreciate that there will be other occasions to debate those matters, we are talking here about codes of practice on picketing and on secondary action. We all know that the Tory Party is seized with the terrible problems arising out of the steel dispute where both forms
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0653">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>281</span>
of action are going on. I think that some of the more intelligent members of the Tory Party are beginning to recognise that it was the actions of the Secretary of State for Industry and the Prime Minister which precipitated the appalling situation that we now have on our hands. They have managed in a very short time to turn one of the most moderate trade unions, which has not had a major strike in 56 years, into a bunch of raving militants, in their terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about codes of practice on secondary picketing. The steel industry is a good example of the absolute uselessness of any code of practice, or even any legislation on secondary picketing. At the outset of the steel dispute, many steelworkers started to picket outside their steelworks, and it took them only three or four days to recognise that there was not much point in picketing a steelworks where not one ounce of steel was being produced. Yet there were still constant flows of steel into this country from abroad, and they realised that, unless they took action to block the steel which was coming into the country, their action was a waste of time. The whole question of picketing at the steelworks became a nonsense and, from the men's point of view—I am not for a moment suggesting that they were right—it was common sense that, if their strike was to be effective, and not a pointless exercise standing outside an empty steelworks not producing anything, they had better get down to the docks and block the steel which was flowing into this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that the code of practice which the Secretary of State would draw up would take account of that. I shall be fascinated to learn, how the Secretary of State will take cognisance of secondary picketing which is a legitimate action of workers such as the steelworkers. The point at issue is whether the Secretary of State is the right man in all circumstances, to draw up a code of practice. ACAS has created a tremendous amount of knowledge in these areas. Is it right that an ACAS code of practice—or parts of it—should be overruled by the Secretary of State? That is a recipe for disaster. I urge the Under-Secretary to think carefully about what is being proposed in relation to subsection (7). As my right hon. Friend made emphatically
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>282</span>
clear, no one is suggesting that the Secretary of State should have his authority overruled. The whole purpose is to try to avoid future conflict. For instance, the Secretary of State, because of pressures upon him, might disagree with codes of practice already drawn up by ACAS. We must recognise that Secretaries of State are subject to considerable pressures, not only from outside bodies—the TUC or the CBI for instance—but, even from their own Back Benchers when scores, if not hundreds, sign early-day motions which are almost tantamount to motions of no confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have learned in the past few days the appalling pressures which are placed upon Secretaries of State within the Cabinet where the arguments take place. The Secretary of State, against his better judgment and because of Cabinet decisions, could have forced upon him the necessity to overrule a code of practice which ACAS has already prepared. For that reason we suggest that the Under-Secretary should think again. He should recognise that this is an important amendment and that it would be in his best interests to accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the get-outs which Ministers, and particularly Secretaries of State, have from time to time when dreadful pressures are put upon them by their own Back Benchers or from within the Cabinet, is to be able to say, "Yes, I understand your feelings. I understand your point of view. I understand the pressures upon you from your constituencies, but the legislation precludes me from doing that." We are suggesting a useful amendment which will be of benefit to the Secretary of State when he has to deal with such appalling pressures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We appreciate that it is easy to sit down in the lonely offices of the Department of Employment and write a code of practice which may look perfect as long as it stops in the Department of Employment. The trouble is that when the damned thing gets on the shop floor, where the men involved in that code of practice have to read it and understand it and, more importantly, accept it, the difficulties start.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am convinced that the Secretary of State for Employment is relieved that his Bill is not on the statute book now during the steel strike. I am sure that he is aware that for all the hot air which flows from certain sections of the Tory Party, the Bill
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0654">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>283</span>
would be useless to him in the context of what is going on in the steel industry today. The Minister should think again about the negative answer that he gave this morning and recognise the constructive approach from this side and the useful amendment. I hope that he will appreciate that we are trying to assist his Department in its fight against the hard reactionary men who, unfortunately, share the same party with him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment so ably moved by my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker). The rejection of the amendment is, in effect, a vote of no confidence in ACAS. It is no secret that there are many members of the Opposition who have always hated ACAS. This has been expressed on numerous occasions on the Floor of the House and in Committee. I recall that two years ago when I introduced my Private Member's Bill to amend the Employment Protection Act many speeches were made suggesting that ACAS was the tool of the trade union movement; not a view that is shared by the Secretary of State. During the Grunwick dispute he issued a statement that he hoped that the management of Grunwick would accept the view of ACAS. That is on record. We all know that there are deep divisions in the Conservative Party on this matter the backwoods men are still endeavouring to claim that ACAS is a tool of the trade union movement, but many of its decisions are resented by the trade union movement. Certainly there is no universal acclamation of ACAS by the trade union movement. The TUC recognises that ACAS has done a first class job and holds the philosophy that one wins some industrial battles and loses some. By and large ACAS does a first class job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that the Secretary of State is the sole authority for issuing codes of conduct and that it will be necessary for him to circulate his document to the trade unions and to employers' organisations for consultation. What better method of consultation is there than ACAS, which is composed of representatives of employers' organisations, the trades unions and academics. As an impartial body it could draft a code of conduct and then submit it to the Secretary of State.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>284</span>
No one is denying that in the last analysis the Secretary of State has authority to accept or reject advice that is given to him. Obviously he must rely upon certain expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When ACAS was formed, the real specialists in industrial relations went to ACAS. Who does the Secretary of State turn to for advice when all the experts in industrial relations are employed by ACAS? I assume that he is doubtful about its ability to give him advice on a code of conduct. ACAS is capable of giving advice, except, as my learned Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) has said in certain circumstances it may be reluctant to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, if ACAS were asked to produce a code of conduct on relations in the newspaper industry, it might consider that there were political overtones and it might be reluctant to draw up a code of conduct. All that the amendment asks is that codes of conduct which have already been drawn up or are in process of being drawn up by ACAS should be acceptable to the Minister because of the expertise behind them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are faced with two alternatives. We either allow the experts, composed as they are of trade union and management representatives to consider these problems and to come to a conclusion, or we allow the Secretary of State to be influenced by the prejudice of his Back Benchers and to decide politically to prejudice or unbalance any measure that they bring forward. That would create a reluctance by the trade union movement to accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all aware of how political prejudice plays a part in policy-making. We know that the Industrial Relations Act was forced through the House, in spite of the tremendous document, the Donovan report, suggesting lines to create better industrial relations. The expertise and work of many years in the Donovan report was ignored by the Government to their cost. At the end of the day they saw the whole edifice that they had created collapse. Indeed, a pledge was given in the House that they would never, under any circumstances, return to the Industrial Relations Act. It is true that they are not doing that in exactly the same circumstances, but they are attempting to introduce sections of that Act piece by piece.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0655">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>285</span>
We shall have another instalment when the Government have considered further additions to the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all these reasons, the Government would be rash to reject this reasonable amendment which suggests that ACAS should be regarded as a body of experts who are capable of drawing up codes of conduct. We say that those codes of conduct should be submitted and accepted by the Minister, as he accepts a great deal of other expert advice from his departmental servants, and that they should have a place in law—or a semi-place in law, since they involve no legal sanctions. They have a valuable function to perform in law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unwise for the Government to reject the amendment, and I hope that even if we cannot have a categorical assurance that they are prepared to accept the amendment, they will think about it and possibility come to the Committee at a later stage to suggest a compromise so that ACAS can play a real and valuable role in industrial relations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government's intention and hope is that ACAS will continue to play the valuable and helpful role to which the hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher) referred. Our confident expectation is that it will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I bring the Committee back to the purpose of subsection (7) which the amendment seeks to change. It begins by saying that the Secretary of State, under the clause, shall have power to draw up and issue codes of practice, and he shall have that power only after he has first consulted with ACAS and thereafter heard representations from other sources about the draft. I have indicated the two areas in which it is the present intention of the Government, if voluntary agreement cannot be obtained, to produce such codes of practice. Let us suppose that one or both of those codes, or such another code as the Secretary of State may in the fullness of time may wish to issue, conflicts with some existing code drawn up either by himself or by ACAS. Subsection (7) provides that if that happens the Secretary of State shall have power to make an order that supersedes either part or the whole of that earlier code. That is all that it provides. The argument on subsection (7) turns on whether there should be power for the Secretary of State to issue
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>286</span>
a code of practice at all. The argument on subsection (7) applies to the whole clause. That being so I repeat that there is no intention to express lack of confidence in ACAS. I have said more than once that the Secretary of State does not envisage issuing a code except when, for one reason or another, ACAS considered itself or is thought to be incapable of producing a code of its own. But there may be some overlapping. Let us consider a hypothetical case. In the fullness of time ACAS may produce a code on the closed shop, but the Secretary of State may wish to introduce provisions that have a bearing on the freedom of the press. A code introduced by the Secretary of State may overlap the provisions of a code previously produced by ACAS. It is right that there should be power for the Secretary of State to override those provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is any lingering doubt about whether it is intended that there should be any expression of no confidence, let it be noted that under the provisions of schedule 1(4) ACAS will have a parallel power to override or supersede in a code which it itself produces the provisions of a code of practice issued by the Secretary of State. That is the mirror image of the Secretary of State's power to supersede the whole or part of an ACAS code. I hope that that illustrates the good faith and evenhandedness of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no present intention to override or supersede any existing code of practice issued by ACAS. Various lurid allegations have been made about our colleagues in the Government by the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) and the hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher). My silence in that context must not be taken as implying agreement but merely a desire to save the time of the Committee. The Government set out in their manifesto the broad structure of the proposals that now find detailed implementation in the Bill. I do not propose to take the time of the Committee in following hon. Members with their various lurid and highly speculative pictures of great and deep division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been argued that there are great pressures on the Secretary of State and that this amendment will protect him by enabling him to say, "The law prevents me from yielding to these pressures." The Government must do what they believe to be right. It is important that they do
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0656">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>287</span>
not trammel themselves by unnecessary restrictions by having to obtain the consent of ACAS before exercising the power with which subsection (7) invests them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is so important that it is worth repeating that ACAS has the full confidence of the Government. However ACAS may be prevented for one reason or another—its representational structure for example—from providing in a code which it produces itself everything which the Secretary of State believes should be included. That is why we believe that it is wrong to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether we are clear about what the Minister said about the schedule. The background note on the clause which he provided us with states:
	<br><q><p>"There will be a reciprocal ability for new ACAS Codes to supersede any previous Codes—in whole or in part—including any previously issued by the Secretary of State under this clause."</p></q>
I take that to mean that a new ACAS code could supersede the Secretary of State's code. But that would still have to go to the House, and the Government would be in precisely the same position—or would they? I am not clear what position the Government would be in. They might not want to reject the whole code but have an amended code. Whose code would come before the House?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any code produced by ACAS has to be approved by the Secretary of State before it is presented to Parliament. The point is fair. The last word remains with the Secretary of State. However the provision in the schedule reflects the Government's belief that it is wise and sensible that a new code shall have power to supersede that part of a preceding code with which it is in conflict. There is nothing sinister in this. It is simply our desire to make sensible legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) thought that there was some resigning on the Government's part from the Secretary of State's view on Second Reading, that ACAS was of incredible value. The Secretary of State, in proposing to repeal sections 11 to 16 of the 1975 Act, has heeded the urgent representations of ACAS that they gravely impede it in the performance
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>288</span>
of many of its duties. The code-making power of the Secretary of State will in no way undermine ACAS. I repeat that ACAS itself has made no representations to this effect. There will be close consultation with the service when it is proposed to issue any code. The Secretary of State sees no need in the foreseeable future for any amendment, or supersession by the Secretary of State of any code that ACAS has already produced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman keeps trailing his coat in a most provocative way. We have not brought into the debate questions of codes on press freedom, picketing and the closed shop. I am resisting the temptation to pursue those hares. But we shall come to them in the fullness of time. Now the hon. and learned Gentleman has added to his provocations by making references to sections 11 to 16 of the Employment Protection Act. I shall not be tempted, much as it appeals to me, but I again give notice that we shall, in the fullness of time, debate those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the most disturbing thing that the hon. and learned Gentleman has said this morning is about the powers of the Secretary of State in relation to codes of practice produced by ACAS. If he had not said that, I should be saying to him that in view of the provisions of schedule 1, it makes no sense for the Government to continue to resist our proposition. What we seek in the amendment is already implicit in the schedule. That is the assurance that the hon. and learned Gentleman sought to give us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, he acknowledged in reply to a question that the Secretary of State had the power to turn down an ACAS code. I have described to the Committee the way in which that power was in practice exercised by the responsible Minister when the present codes of practice were produced by ACAS. But it seems that the great reserve and caution with which we approached the use of that power will not be exercised by the Secretary of State and his hon. and Learned Friend. That causes me great disquiet and makes me all the more convinced of the necessity of the amendment. The hon. and learned Gentleman said it would be nonsence to have two codes of practice which overlap each other. In that case, clearly the Secretary of State would want to fill in

We have made it clear that we have a great deal or sympathy with the Secretary of State and the Under Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not think that they are upon the disaster course upon which some or their colleagues in the Government have embarked. But the Secretary of State is not immortal. He will not hold office for ever and a day. He certainly will not be there much longer than four or five years, at best. According to what we read in the newspapers he may not be there for longer than four or five weeks. We are making law. We are proposing to give a great power to a Secretary of State, whether it is the right hon. Member for Lowestoft (Mr. Prior) or the right hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Sir K. Joseph) or whoever. I am anxious to know how they would approach the exercise of this power. Despite the bland and emollient assurances by the hon. and learned Gentleman, with all the skill that he has learned at the Bar. the subsection gives power to the Secretary of State to wipe away a code of practice that has been carefully prepared by the people involved in the day-to-day management of industrial relations, who know what to do infinitely better than all of us in the</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Committee—God bless us. He is being given the power to put aside a code that has been vetted by the Secretary of State and has received the approval of Parliament, and to impose on industrial relations a code out of the recesses of his mind. That is not good enough.</p>
	<p>All that the hon. and learned Gentleman has said has only reinforced my conviction that we were right to table the amendment. The right hon. and learned Gentleman thought that the most powerful argument for rejecting the amendment was that he had not received any representations to alter this subsection. We have not received any representations about our amendment. If that is a good argument for leaving the clause as it stands, it is an equally good argument for passing the amendment.</p>
	<p>What the hon and learned Gentleman has said reinforces my conviction that we must press the amendment to a vote. I do not think that we should take up any more of the Committee's time, Mr. Leadbitter. I think the Committee should proceed to a decision. I hope that the decision will be that the Secretary of State should be under the obligation set out in the amendment.</p>

not want the rest of the clause to stand—we have our reservations, which we have already expressed in part and shall no doubt express further on clause stand part—but I stress that the amendment could well be accepted by the Government, and were it to be, that might well considerably condition our attitude towards the rest of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our concern is about giving the Secretary of State such wide ranging undiluted powers to produce codes of practice. That has already been the subject of debate this morning, and nothing that was said by the Under-Secretary of State about the schedule has allayed our fears in this respect. My own response is that that part of the schedule, in light of what he said, is barely worth the paper it is written on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt, my hon. Friend has noticed that the schedule to which he has just referred is headed "Minor and Consequential amendments". It strikes me as extraordinary, in the light of the debate and the views that have been expressed, that such a far-reaching provision as that referred to in the schedule should be described as either "minor" or "consequential".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose it depends where one is sitting whether one considers it a minor or major matter. At any rate, our concern is that in the overall context of codes of practice we see ACAS as very much on the sidelines. One could even say that it is receding into the background. When these codes come before the House, it will not be possible to amend them. We have already had a debate on that. We must take them lock, stock and barrel. The Under-Secretary of State said this morning that a majority of codes would be produced by ACAS. What he really meant, of course, was that those codes which could perhaps be described as non-contentious will be produced by ACAS. He mentioned the closed shop and press freedom, and, he mentioned picketing. Those contentious codes will not be codes with which ACAS will want to have much, if anything, to do. At least, this amendment would mean—this is the nub of the argument—that codes produced albeit by ACAS or by the Secretary of State would be mere guides, and they would not be admissible in proceeding
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>292</span>
before the courts or anywhere else. For instance, on the question of picketing we have not seen the whites of the Government's eyes yet. We do not know what they will produce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or the reds of the Government's eyes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or, as my right hon. Friend says, the reds of their eyes, or the true blues of their eyes. But it is clear that they do not want to produce a code on picketing, ACAS has already made clear that it does not want to have any truck with that particular code, and the hon. and learned Gentleman has again this morning referred to voluntary codes. But the chances of a voluntary code being agreed in the light of the legislation the Government have produced, and in the light of their general attitude, are so slender as to be almost non-existent. So the government will have to force through their laws. We cannot be sure that this Secretary of State or some future Secretary of State—perhaps it is even more relevant in respect of a future Secretary of State—will not seek to tighten the law by imposing a tougher code of practice, which both the courts and the tribunals would be compelled to upset. That sort of development could happen on the issue of picketing. The TUC has already told the Government that it fears that any code it produces in that area is bound to be inflexible. It could happen in relation to the closed shop. It seems that the Government code on that would be likely to be tightly drawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot see much prospect of voluntary codes in these areas. The TUC's voluntary guidance will be seriously undermined by the proposals in clause 3, and its disputes machinery will be gravely damaged. The Government know all this too, so they will have to rely increasingly not only on the legislative proposals in the Bill but on these codes which will be legally admissible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have told the TUC that guidance on balloting arrangements in closed shop situations will be included in their code of practice, and industrial tribunals will have to take account of the code in deciding unfair dismissal cases arising out of a closed shop. All this is highly contentious. We are talking, in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0659">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>293</span>
effect, about statutory codes, and that writ would run in every court in the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The closed shop code, as the hon. and learned Gentleman reminded us, would include special provisions for the press. That is the Government's present intention. The Secretary of State said on Second Reading:
	<br><q><p>"We intend to provide specific guidance on the subject in the code to ensure that press freedom is not infringed."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 December 1979; Vol. 976, c. 63.]</p></q>
If it is in the code in this form, it will not be what he called "guidance". We are talking here about detailed statutory regulation of the closed shop, and any press charter will be part and parcel of that. The newspaper industry has already got its own battery of lawyers to deal particularly with libel matters, and it will need still more of them in the future to deal with industrial relations matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who knows Fleet Street knows what a jungle that place has been for years in terms of industrial relations. Anyone who thinks that the lawyers will be able to sort that situation out needs his head examined, but that is the direction in which the Government will be steering them. They know that ACAS does not want to have anything to do with codes on picketing, and it seems highly probable that it will not want to have anything to do with the code on the closed shop. If this subsection is deleted, at least we shall get rid of the consequences of codes being admissible in the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill as a whole will give a massive fillip to the legal profession, just as the 1971 Act did. There will be some rich pickings in that direction, and we all know at whose expense they will be made—at the expense of working people who will be the subject of this legislation. New areas of controversy will end up before future generations of Lord Dennings if a Labour Government do not get back and repeal this nonsense. The codes, far from being seen as a way of improving industrial relations, will be part of what many people will see as a legal straitjacket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth reminding the Committee that the Government's own working papers said that the codes would help to bring about a more consistent interpretation of the law by police and magistrates. That was specifically on the question of codes. There is not much doubt
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>294</span>
that the administration of the criminal law by police and magistrates in certain circumstances, especially in respect of picketing, would be very much subject to a code. Such a code would be admissible there, so we believe that no code should take us beyond the position in the Employment Protection Act 1975 where a code is admissible before the CAC or industrial tribunal. That is as far as it should go. Hence our amendments to delete the reference to courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our other amendment suggesting that "shall" should be replaced by "may" is also an important amendment because, as the subsection is drafted, a tribunal or the CAC would have no discretion to disregard a code even if it wanted to perhaps because of the circumstances of a particular case. I know that "shall" was used in the 1975 Act, but under that Act codes were drawn up by ACAS and the courts were not involved. This is the distinction that we make in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overall, these are sweeping general powers which take us a long way beyond the 1975 Act and we therefore think it highly desirable that these amendments should be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State's powers should be curbed. When he looks over his shoulder at his Cabinet colleagues, the right hon. Gentleman may well feel that his freedom is pretty limited anyway. With friends like that, who needs enemies? We are convinced that within what is a thoroughly reprehensible Bill anyway, this particular provision cannot escape condemnation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would help to remind the Committee at the outset of the provision in the Employment Protection Act 1975 that relates to codes of practice which ACAS is empowered to make. We have looked at section 6 before, but I now draw the Committee's attention to subsection (11) which provides that
	<br><q><p>"a failure on the part of any person to observe any provision or a code or practice shall not of itself render him liable to any proceedings; but that in any proceedings in an industrial tribunal or the Central Arbitration Committee any code of practice issued under this section shall be admissible in evidence, and if any provision of such a code appears to the tribunal or Committee to be relevant to any question arising in the proceedings it shall be taken into account in determining that question."</p></q>
That is the formula employed in the present subsection (8) which these amendments would remove.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0660">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>295</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman expostulates in a dramatic manner. That is the formula with one exception—that to the industrial tribunal and the Central Arbitration Committee there is added the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For a long time my wife had one of those plastic roses that were given out by the soap manufacturers with packets of soap powder. She would put it on the windowsill at home in summer along with the freshly cut roses from my garden. The funny thing is that, from the same distance as that between you and me, Mr. Leadbitter, they were indistinguishable. The plastic rose was perfect. I never saw a fly attempt to sip its nectar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is fascinating. The right hon. Gentleman's botanical experiences bring pleasure and light to our proceedings, much as the plastic rose must have done to his home, but I am not sure that they advance his argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We say here that if one sees force and value in codes of practice, it is desirable to set forth with clarity in the legislation the use that may be made of them and the influence which they are intended to have. That was done by the previous Government, valuably and sensibly, in the 1975 Act. That is what is sought to be done in subsection (8).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We established at our last sitting that we were agreed on the value of codes of practice. The Opposition now propose to knock out subsection (8)—the equivalent of Section 6(11) of the 1975 Act—and leave the matter at large.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The opening few minutes of the speech of the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) in moving the amendment, revealed a misunderstanding. He said that the nub of the argument was that the codes produced by the Secretary of State, would, if the amendment were carried, be mere guidance and would not be admissible in the courts or anywhere else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the Government's understanding—I say this with confidence—that that is not correct. By removing subsection (8) we should not be preventing a court or a tribunal from taking account of any code of practice. We should merely be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>296</span>
sowing quite unnecessary doubt, perhaps in the minds more of lay practitioners than of others, as to what Parliament actually intended when it made the distinction that would appear on the face of the two statutes. In the 1975 Act we have section 6(11), but, lo and behold, in the 1980 Bill the equivalent subsection would not be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The courts cannot be prevented from taking into account any code of practice, guidelines or whatever. In the fairly recent case of United Biscuits v. Fell, it will be recalled that in fact the court had regard to voluntary guidelines or a voluntary code that was operated by the AUEW. That was not, of course, because there was any statutory reference to it. It was because the courts these days take a more liberal and wide-ranging view of the available evidence than they used to take in more rigid times. They like to inform themselves of anything that may be relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference is that here would be a code or codes of practice issued by the Secretary of State but with no guidance contained in the statute giving him those powers as to what influence they should have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman's statement is fascinating—that the courts take a more liberal view in interpreting issues such as this. Does that apply, for instance, to the Master of the Rolls in his rather capricious interpretation of legislation? The judgment of the House of Lords in this respect was that it was not for judges but for Parliament to make law. The Under Secretary's views on the liberal attitude of the courts are not shared by everyone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to the liberal attitude of the courts in looking at all relevant evidence. I should have thought that what I said applied to the Master of the Rolls, Lord Denning, perhaps more vividly than to any other judge on the Bench. Lord Denning has never regarded himself as bound by the stricter rules of evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But my point is important. That is why the hon. Member for Islington, Central rightly described it, as the nub of the argument. He believes that his amendment would reduce the codes to mere guidance which would not be admissable
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0661">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>297</span>
in the courts or anywhere else. That simply is not right. The important point, if we are to provide codes, is that there should be guidance on what influence they are to have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I talked about it being the nub of the argument, but there is all the difference in the world between a situation where something is clearly guidance and one where the courts will be required to take it into account. That, in essence, is what the Bill as drafted says—that they shall be required to take these codes into account. One cannot rule out that a court might want to take any given situation into account, but this is putting the onus very much on the Secretary of State's legislative proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a proper distinction to make, that the court would not be required to take something into account, but it does not bear out what the hon. Gentleman said that it would not be admissable in the courts or anywhere else. It would be admissable. Therefore, it raises the question why a code of practice prepared and issued by the Secretary of State and approved by Parliament after consultation with ACAS, which is all that is required, as we now know so well should have a lesser status than a code of practice issued by ACAS under section 6 of the 1975 Act. The 1975 Act requires the courts to take that into account, and I do not see that one could produce any persuasive argument as to why a code of practice which the Secretary of State by a later statute, is empowered to issue should have a lesser status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, it would make unclear in relevant proceedings, whether before a court or before a tribunal the status of a code or practice issued by the Secretary of State. We have a duty in the House to make clear law. We may disagree on what its content ought to be, but we ought not to disagree that the law that we make should be clear and not give rise to needless uncertainties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Third, courts or, on the wider amendments, industrial tribunals and the CAC would not be denied access to the codes, for the reasons that I have given. Therefore, I believe that these amendments would increase the prospect of codes issued under clause 2 being unevenly
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>298</span>
applied, to the detriment of good industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always understood, and I understand the reasons for it, that the Opposition have a bias in favour of the law being strictly drawn where it relates to industrial relations. They say that they would like to keep the law out as much as possible. They believe that the judges ought not to be allowed to interpret statutes passed by Parliament bearing upon industrial relations law. They like to have such statutes as there are tightly and closely expressed, and, apart from that, they believe that ACAS and the CAC really represent the best means of dealing with industrial relations disputes. I understand that attitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invite the Opposition to reflect that if, by this amendment, they create the uncertainty that I have suggested will arise, they will be doing the very thing that they wish to avoid. They present to the judiciary questions that have been left uncertain by Parliament, and they open up the very area of judicial interpretation about which they express such suspicion. I do not believe that those suspicions are justified. But if we in the House make uncertain law, if we make difficult or obscure law, as I believe the 1976 and the 1974 Acts have provided, one gets conflicting decisions from time to time between the various hierarchies of the courts. We all want to avoid that. It is because these groups of amendments will lead to unnecessary uncertainty and will not achieve the purpose that I believe they should be resisted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has made the argument about the need for consistency to avoid confusion in the courts between the approach adopted in the 1975 Act and the approach adopted in the clause. What he has not done so far—I was rather hoping that he would—is provide justification for not following as he thinks it desirable to do the form of the 1975 Act by restricting the use of codes for purposes of evidence to the tribunals and the CAC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman made the point that, whether we say it or not, there is nothing to stop the courts from using the Codes and looking at the codes. If that is the case why is it necessary to put the word in the Bill and not to include
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0662">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>299</span>
an amendment in the Bill to insert the word in the 1975 Act? That is consistency one would expect. We would certainly oppose it as we are opposing its insertion here, but if he is saying that it is not necessary to put the word in, why do so? If he feels it necessary, he should put it in both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall tell the Committee why the hon. and learned Gentleman has not included it in the 1975 Act. He knows perfectly well that ACAS from then on would say "We are not having any part to play in the production of any code of practice that will be used in the courts. We are not in that business." That is the difference between the two, and I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will now come clean and tell us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a perfectly simple distinction. The codes of practice at present envisaged by the Government would relate to picketing and the closed shop. That has been made clear. The codes of practise which ACAS is required to issue under section 6 of the 1975 Act, and to which it is likely to give its mind, relate to matters whose interpretation would be the province of the industrial tribunal and the Central Arbitration Committee. There was no call in 1975 to add "courts" to subsection (11). But in the case of picketing one can readily see that there may be circumstances in which a code of practice relating, for example, to numbers may be thought to be relevant in a court which is dealing with an obstruction charge. I should have thought that that was an obvious illustration of circumstances in which a court might find relevance in what had been said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, in order to meet a circumstance that may arise it is thought right to include the word "court." It has not been necessary to include court proceedings in the list of proceedings in which ACAS codes should be taken into account because by their nature they are more relevant to industrial tribunal or CAC proceedings. Courts and other bodies are free already to take codes into account, and even voluntary codes such as the T & GWU code in the road haulage dispute in the case of United Biscuits v Fell. That is one illustration in which the courts are not obliged to regard a provision in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>300</span>
the code as relevant but they are obliged to have a look at it and take it into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has indicated that even if we do not write something into the Bill the courts would still be free to take into account the code of practice. He cited the United Biscuits case and made the point that, particularly in regard to picketing, courts may take it into account. Does that mean that he intends to accept amendment No. 19, to delete the word "shall", which is obviously an instruction, and will accept the word "may", which would allow a court, if it so desired, to take into account the provisions of the code of practice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. If the hon. Gentleman reads the wording closely he will see that the court shall take it into account—the code shall be admissible and it shall be taken into account. That does not mean that any provision shall be regarded as decisive of any issue that is before the court. It is saying, as was said in 1975, that the provisions of the code shall be taken into account—that is, that one cannot come to a decision until one has looked at them and weighed them. That is what is meant there. Therefore, I shall certainly not advise my hon Friends to accept amendment No. 19.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could I be clear on this? I think that I should not be misinterpreting the hon. and learned Gentleman if I said that he confirmed a few moments ago what I said in my opening remarks, that the Government are prepared, through codes of practice, to bring the criminal law into industrial relation situations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that anybody with the barest knowledge of the existing law would know and recognise that the criminal law is already in industrial relations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the trouble.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me answer the question that has been put to me. We know that picketing can give rise to five or six separate charges. Offences can be committed in the course of picketing that range from obstruction to threatening

behaviour. I think, Mr. Leadbitter, that this is a difficult enough and serious enough issue to warrant being dealt with without continual interruption. I have been fair and reasonable in giving way. when asked to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The criminal law can be involved already, and I have given illustrations of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And this is another one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not. It is a variant of the many examples that at present exist. If, for example, a charge of obstruction is brought because there are large numbers of people who say that they claim immunity under section 15 of the 1974 Act since they are attending for the purpose of peacefully persuading or imparting information—we all know the formula—it will be relevant for a court to have regard to what the code of practice may say as to numbers. That may be relevant. The court is not being told that it must take that into account and regard it as decisive, but it may be relevant, just as numbers today, under the existing criminal law, are relevant to a charge of obstruction or a charge of obstructing the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of Piddington v Bates in 1963 a conviction was upheld where a police officer said that three was too many and that two would have been sufficient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric G. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the distinction that the hon. and learned Gentleman is making, but is it not the case that while the criminal law can be involved at the moment under the existing law, on the basis of numbers and whether the police decide that somebody is obstructing the highway or something of that kind, if the Secretary of State produces a code on picketing, as the hon. and learned Gentleman says he will, and in that code he lists numbers and makes absolutely clear what he regards as a sufficient number for a peaceful picket, and then that number is exceeded and the police go around counting the people with this new fresh code in their hands, the criminal law will certainly be involved at that stage?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will that not result in a highly charged situation, where perhaps one picket—one more than the prescribed number—is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>302</span>
hauled away by the police and charged before the courts? Will that not worsen industrial relations instead of dealing with the matter in the delicate way it is done at the moment, with police and pickets coming together and in most cases mutually agreeing what the numbers should be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point, but I think that the argument is exactly the reverse. At the moment, as the right hon. Gentleman knows, a discretion is cast upon the police on the spot to determine when the criminal law is being broken and if so, how it shall be enforced, and whether it shall be enforced. They are without any guidance whatsoever as regards numbers. In a difficult situation such as this, it will always rest with the discretion of police officers on the spot. It must do, and nobody would wish otherwise. If a code of practice on picketing were to stipulate certain numbers as being desirable maxima, that itself would not be binding upon the police—it would be binding upon nobody—but it would be a relevant consideration and it would give guidance to those organising a picket line, just as it would give guidance to employers, to those who were being asked to take part in a picket, and to police who have the difficult job of keeping public order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the things which is so often said to be unsatisfactory in the law on picketing at the moment is that there appears to be absolutely no guidance. Yet all of us know that the greatest element of fear and intimidation that is imparted on picket lines comes from mass pickets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked to deal with the matter on the basis of the circumstances in which the government envisages a court taking into account a code of practice on picketing. That is one illustration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman suggests that this will bring the criminal law into picketing and make it worse. I reject that suggestion. I believe that, by giving guidance which will not be binding but which will be persuasive and influential, it will provide some of the guidance and advice that is lacking at the moment. It will be guidance which will have been approved by Parliament. I absolutely understand the anxieties that have been expressed and the importance that is attached to this part of the Bill, but I believe that, if looked

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>303</span>
at in a dispassionate and fair way, provision is seen to be desirable necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. and learned Gentleman says that this will not reduce the discretion of the police in deciding whether to prosecute or not in certain circumstances, is he not being rather naive? We are to be presented with a code of practice which is likely at least to lay down certain numbers—a code which, if the matter comes to court, must be taken into account by the court. Yet he is suggesting that the police will not be influenced by it, as though they will make up their minds as if the code were not there and only when it gets to court will they say "Oh, my goodness, here we have a code. This supports what we have been saying all the time".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the police will be influenced in making their decision by what the code says. It is bound to reduce the discretion of the police. There is a code of practice there which has the approval of Parliament, produced by the Secretary of State. The police look at it, they compare the facts on the ground with the position set out in the code, and it will be a brave chief constable who says "Although what is happening there is clearly in breach of this code, actually the code has no compulsion on me and therefore I will take no notice of it". No chief constable will say he is taking no notice of a code of practice produced by the Secretary of State and approved by Parliament and which must be taken into account if the matter gets to court. Of course, he will be influenced. Of course, his discretion will be reduced. And, of course, there will be more cases going to the criminal court as a result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meyhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope and expect that a chief constable will take it into account. After all, it will be practical guidance on picketing which will have been approved by Parliament, so I would expect him to take it into account and hope that he would take it into account. It would be desirable that he should. But there is nothing new in this concept. In the guidelines issued by the TUC as an annexe to the so-called concordat in February last year, under the heading "Organisation of Picketing", one reads that the organiser of pickets
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>304</span>
	<br><q><p>"should ensure that the number of pickets is no larger than is necessary."</p></q>
That was thought to be a desirable guide, and I may say that, for the reasons that I was advancing a few minutes ago, the courts cannot be prevented from taking that guideline into account, just as similar guides were taken into account by the court in United Biscuits v. Fell. Can it be contended that there is no place for a code or guide, prepared after consultation of the type that is made obligatory in the Bill, and approved by Parliament? If we are to have the courts looking at guides, let them be guides which have been prepared after wide consultation and approved by Parliament. Then we shall have some help being given to all those who take part, whether from choice or through compulsion, in one role or another in this difficult and anxious activity of picketing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little surprised that the hon. and learned Gentleman, a man of impeccable honour, did not feel it necessary, before he defended subsection (8), to declare his interest. He has a big interest. In the next Parliament, when he will not longer hold ministerial office because he will be in opposition, he will I am sure have a number of juicy briefs on cases which will be heard under this legislation. He will undoubtedly quote in the courts on behalf of his clients the codes of practice which will be issued under this clause if the Bill is enacted. Not only he but many of his colleagues at the Bar will do very well out of it. Not many others will do well out of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman knows well that repeal or great changes in industrial relations legislation take time. After all, it is now eight or nine months since he took office and he is still ploughing slowly through the mud on the measure before us. It will certainly take more than a year to put things right, and the hon. and learned Gentleman and some of his learned friends will in that year do good business. But it will be bad business for the rest of the country.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0665">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>305</span>
It will be bad not only for the trade union movement and individual trade unionists but for industry as a whole. I can see it resulting in a great deal of industrial dislocation precisely because of the provision in subsection (8) which allows codes of practice or evidence about failure to observe codes of practice to be produced before the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If ever I am offered the post of Secretary of State for Employment, a contingency which I do not rate as very likely, I shall accept the offer on one condition—that before I go there every office occupied by a Minister or a senior official of the Department shall have painted on one wall in letters at least a foot high "Remember the Kent miners". On the opposite wall shall be painted in letters at least a foot high "Remember the Pentonville Five".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What do we put on the other two walls? I suggest two more specimens of 	<i>memento mori.</i> One would be a photograph of my dear friend Mrs. Barbara Castle, and the other a big photograph of the right hon. Member for Sidcup (Mr. Heath), who was the last leader of the Conservative Party and who was Prime Minister until he committed hara-kiri precisely on this issue in January 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those slogans and those pictures on the walls, I and my colleagues would never succumb to any temptation to extend the area within which workers can be brought before the courts for actions in furtherance of their duties as members of a trade union which are not within the criminal law. The more one does it, the more trouble one will be in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman suggested that all would be easier, clearer and less difficult to settle if we had access to the courts under subsection (8). I thought that that argument was abstruse, etiolated and legally stratospheric. It was a lawyer's argument and not the argument of a man who knows or cares about, industrial relations. Never mind what the Minister says about this. Let us look at what will happen in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that Joe Bloggs, a worker, is brought before the courts for some offence—not for failing to observe the code of practice—but for some other offence. In the course of the hearing, evidence is given that he failed to observe a code of practice. He is sentenced. He
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>306</span>
and all his workmates will believe that his failure to observe the code of practice led to, or at least contributed to, his being convicted, or at least that it added to his penalty or length of a prison sentence. All the abstruse, etiolated arguments from the hon. and learned Gentleman will not make it look any different to the chap in that dock and his workmates. If that happens the hon. and learned Gentleman had better carry around with him wherever he goes the telephone number of the Official Solicitor because he will need it, just as one of his predecessors needed it to get off the hook for putting the Pentonville Five in prison. He will be in exactly the same position as one of his predecessors who had to send a deputation to a prison to beg the leaders of the Kent miners to come out of prison. Then, everything in the garden was lovely except that no coal was coming out of the Kent mines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister really is treading on dangerous ground. I do not think that he is a malicious man. He just does not understand the public relations impact of court hearings on industrial disputes. Picketing could be involved. It will not be easy to enforce the law when there is a picket line, especially in a dispute which has been given national publicity. A lot of people will go down to that picket line. Let us suppose that there are six or eight pickets and other chaps go talk to them. They will not have armbands and so on. Somebody will come along and count nine fellows there. Those chaps who come along and talk to them might be journalists, or Members of Parliament. It has been known for Members of Parliament to go and talk to pickets. Somebody will count "three, six, seven, eight, nine, 11" when only eight are supposed to be there. There is great danger of starting something much bigger than is bargained for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We might as well pay up and forget. There has to be some way out of this. Surely it is right that the Government should make such a suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not arguing that we should stay as we are but about whether the committee should accept the amendment. I should be out of order if I were arguing about anything else. The hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham), not for the first time, is exhibiting the most extreme naivety. He is suggesting that if one does not like a fresh proposal one is defending the status quo. There are other ways of making changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This proposal represents the worst of all worlds. The hon. Gentleman is saying that the best way to get rid of a headache is to chop off one's head. He may be right. But it is a course which more prudent men than he will be a little reluctant to accept. The inclusion of the word "court" in subsection (8) is dangerous. I forecast that if it is unamended the Government will have to take Kent miners or Pentonville Five measures. They will have to crawl on their bellies, as before, to undo action in the courts taken under subsection (8). If that is what the hon. and learned Gentleman is looking forward to, it can be only because of a total failure to understand relations and practicalities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My few remarks will follow naturally from the wise remarks that we have just heard from my hon. Friend Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo). I am sorry to say that the more I heard from the Under-Secretary the greater was my unease. I am under the impression that the Government are moving away from ACAS and trying to settle these matters by consent and agreement and by what he called, in a rather derogatory tone, guidance. They are moving towards the courts and to the law. Every time that we have moved towards the law tears and disaster have resulted.—We are talking of codes and—I shall be corrected if I am wrong or they are rather similar to the Highway Code. That is not a law but if one is hauled up before the courts frequently having abused the Highway Code one is normally found guilty. The Government propose to introduce codes which will have the effect of law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) invited correction. There is a distinction because the Road Traffic Act 1972 provides in section 37 that any breach of the highway code may:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>308</span>
	<br><q><p>"be relied upon by any party to the proceedings as tending to establish or to negative any liability which is in question in those proceedings."</p></q>
There is a special statutory provision relating to the Highway Code which takes it a little further. There is a similarity but it is not the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not exactly the same but there is some similarity and that is the point that I was making. Our difficulty is that we are in the dark about what will be contained in codes which almost have the effect of law. We are being invited to give a blank cheque to be used when agreement cannot be reached. We are invited to give powers to make controversial laws for picketing and the closed shop which will go through the House of Commons in 90 minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that we seem to be moving away from the tone adopted by the Secretary of State on Second Reading. When discussing the question of picketing, he said:
	<br><q><p>"The normal law as it applies now and has applied in recent weeks and months would continue to apply just as it does today. There would be no difference between the practice now and the practice once the Bill is passed."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 December 1979; Vol, 976, c. 67.]</p></q>
He was reassuring everbody that nothing very much would be done about picketing, that there was no need for anyone to get excited, that things would be roughly the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The air of unreality about our proceedings here is that we know that discussions are taking place outside this Committee. We keep reading about it in the newspapers. Although I, for one, do not believe all I read in the newspapers, I assume that these discussions are going on, and I am fortified in my belief that that is so by this rather interesting comment by the Prime Minister during Prime Minister's Question Time last Thursday:
	<br><q><p>"Certainly, if there are major changes to be made to the Employment Bill upstairs, arising out of that consultative document"—</p></q>
we have not seen the consultative document, no doubt many consultations are going on, and one gathers that there is an air almost of hysteria in certain quarters—
	<br><q><p>"we will follow previous precedents and discuss them on the Floor of the House, before they are committed to the Standing Committee."</p></q>
	<br><q><p>—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 7 February 1980; Vol. 978, s. 737.]</p></q>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>309</span>
So on these sensitive issues on which we are being invited now to give powers, we are taking a leap into the dark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our worry is that these codes will lead us down the road to occasions such as the Kent miners and the Pentonville Five. That is not the way to do it. We prefer the method of consent and agreement. The hon. and learned Gentleman was quite right to say that we are against bringing the law in and if we can help it, and we do not want these matters brought before the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I was sorely tempted by the Under-Secretary, it was not my intention to enter the debate on these amendments. It was the intervention of the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) which brought me in. The hon. Gentleman uttered the words which now seem to be a cry from the heart of the Tory Party—that we must do something about industrial disputes—without analysing what it is that we have to do. None of us likes strikes. We would all like to see industrial peace throughout the United Kingdom. But the fact is that there are strikes and strikes will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is therefore important that we analyse any issue which arose in the past which might be a lesson to us. Surely, one of the great lessons of the past is the event which took place last winter. I accept the hon. Gentleman's comment that it damaged the Labour Party. All of us in the Labour Party know that it damaged us. But it is important that a correct analysis of the situation be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member looks at the events of last winter, he will find that they are of little relevance to the Bill before us. Two groups of workers were involved in disputes, and whether a code of practice would have been relevant I very much doubt. There was the strike of the local authority workers, the low-paid, in which there was no such thing as secondary picketing or secondary action. There was not a single case in the United Kingdom of any group of local authority workers involving themselves in secondary picketing, because, obviously, it would have been a meaningless exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But in the lorry drivers' strike there was widespread secondary picketing. The reason for that was that it was pointless
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>310</span>
for lorry drivers to stand picketing their own depot with their own lifeless wagons lying in the depot. Without going into it now, let me say that I believe that it was EEC regulations which had as much part to play in the causes of that dispute as anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If men are involving themselves in an industrial dispute, one of their intentions is to win the dispute, and it would have been a pointless exercise to picket their own depots, with nothing actually happening in those depots. They had to take action outside in areas where work was being done which affected them. So there is an analysis to be made of the events of last winter, and those events show that the present Bill would have had little relevance in that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn next to the question of bringing the criminal law into industrial relations. The Under-Secretary has repeatedly stated that these provisions will not bring the criminal law into industrial relations, but I wonder whether that is the case. The hon. and learned Gentleman recalls that we went round this track on the Employment Protection Bill for quite a long period, and at that stage it was Labour Back Benchers who were trying to get a code on picketing and got no support from the Conservatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a code of practice is issued in which the numbers involved in a picket are limited, obviously, if the police come along, count the numbers up and recognise that there are more than there should be, they will presumably charge them with obstruction. People will then appear before the courts charged with a criminal offence. If that is not bringing the criminal law into industrial relations, I do not know what is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other grave danger here is the making of martyrs. There will be some people only too glad to welcome the opportunity to appear before the court charged with obstruction on the picket line. They will, of course, be bound over and, as soon as they are released from the court, they will be back on the picket line. Then they will be back in court. One can see how events will go. The offences will be stepped up until eventually they will be put in gaol. Then, presumably, the Secretary of State—if he still holds the office—will have to find the Official Solicitor to get the people who have been gaoled back out of the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>were not now using codes of practice to bring the criminal law into industrial relations, he took a long time to give us a full and explanatory response. The short answer, in a word, was "Yes". That is precisely what they are doing. That is certainly my interpretation of what he said, and that is the way in which my hon. Friends and I would interpret his remarks. In revealing that to us this morning, he has probably sounded the death-knell for voluntary co-operation in the whole matter of codes of practice. That is a great pity, because that kind of co-operation has existed for a long time now between employers and trade unionists in the production of codes.</p>
	<p>It is crystal clear that what we now face is codes drawn up by people in Whitehall, many of them admittedly very able people but not people with any first-hand knowledge or experience of industrial relations situations. Their proposals will be brought to the House and they will be steam-rollered through by the Government with their parliamentary majority for use in the courts, both civil and criminal.</p>
	<p>If the Under-Secretary would tell us this morning that he will accept amendments Nos. 15 and 18, that is, if he would agree to delete the word "court", I should advise my right hon. and hon.
