<div class='page-header'><h1>EMPLOYMENT BILL</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That during the further proceedings on the Employment Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
I can advance the argument for this very shortly. On the basis of morning sittings only, we are not getting on fast enough. After six sittings, we are still not at the end of clause 2. I understand that the first two clauses are not regarded by the Opposition as the most controversial of the Bill. Another 16 remain, plus the schedules, and, at the current rate of progress, I calculate that that would mean at least 57 more mornings spent upon the Bill, or, say, 28 weeks.<br><br>
I make no allegation of filibustering, but the country attaches great importance to this Bill and it wants the Bill upon the statute book as soon as reasonably possible. The Bill is needed on the statute book. If it were there already, picketing carried out at places where the pickets do not work could be restrained by the Courts on an application for an injunction, and daily the country is seeing the need for that provision.<br><br>
Therefore, if we are to meet our responsibilities, the Government must ask the Committee to allow itself more time to consider the Bill in the next few weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eric G. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But for those few remarks by the hon. and learned Gentleman which I regard as extremely provocative, I do not think that we on this side would have serious objections to the sittings motion. I shall show in a moment or two how fallacious is his argument about how urgent the Bill is and how it needs to be put on the statute book quickly. If there is any confusion at all, it is the confusion caused by the Government and not by the proceedings of this
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 316</span>
Committee, and I shall take a little while in explaining what I mean.<br><br>
It has become increasingly clear that the Government have got themselves in a terrible mess, an absolutely appalling mess, about the Bill. We debated the Bill on Second Reading only just over eight weeks ago, and at that stage we thought that we had a definitive measure. If we in fact had that, there would have been some substance in what the Under-Secretary has just said, that we could press ahead, if the Government want to bludgeon it through to the statute book, with all the other things that they want to do.<br><br>
It is true that on Second Reading the Secretary of State hinted that there might well be changes, but at no time during those proceedings did he suggest that there would be major changes to the Bill. He just said that the Government were considering the Express Newspapers v. MacShane case and that they would come forward with proposals on that basis in due course. My right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) at that time suggested that, if the Government were to propose changes, rather than interfere with the present Bill there should be separate legislation.<br><br>
As I understand it, the Secretary of State and the Government have ruled out the possibility of introducing a separate Bill to deal with matters then before the court. I must confess that eight weeks ago, when the Bill was debated on Second Reading, I never expected the Government to get into the sort of confusion and the muddle that they are now in, or to see the maladroit behaviour that they are now practising.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that, at least for the first 12 months of their administration, there would be some cohesiveness about it, but already we see every day in the newspapers stories about doves and hawks, splits in the Cabinet and so on. The Government are proceeding in a most disgraceful way. We were told by the Secretary of State, when he was here, and we are told by the Under-Secretary today, that we can expect changes to the Bill at some stage. The trouble is that we in the Committee are the last group to know what the changes are to be, and I should have thought that hon. Members on the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0673">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 317</span>
Government side would be just as indignant as we are. After all, they, too, are charged by the Committee of Selection on behalf of the House to look at the Bill, and one expects them at some stage to get to their feet and discuss those measures. We have had two brief interventions so far and one or two little speeches from the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst). Otherwise, we have had complete silence. I see dissent in another quarter. Yes, I know that the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South-West (Mr. Page), whom we remember as the Member for Workington in the last Parliament, made a speech which, in our judgment, was not germane to the proceedings before the Committee.<br><br>
So the Government have got themselves into a terrible mess, and we are the last group of people to know what changes are being proposed. That is treating the Committee with discourtesy. I am always moderate in my language; I do not think I can say that they are treating us with contempt at this stage. It depends on what the Under-Secretary says in his reply on this motion. But how are we expected to take the Committee stage seriously if we do not know what proposals the Government will bring forward?<br><br>
We could make a request or a demand that the Secretary of State should be here this morning to answer some of the charges. He is in the normal Thursday morning Cabinet, and obviously he is working hard. I understand that the subject of the Bill and any changes will be before the Cabinet this morning. I suppose that we can therefore excuse the Secretary of State's absence this morning, especially as he is fighting a hard battle. But we see blow-by-blow accounts every day in the newspapers about what is going on, and they make interesting reading.<br><br>
At the moment, the Secretary of State seems to be winning. He seems to be the leading dove within the Cabinet. That has not always been the case, because he has not shown consistent judgment on industrial relations. He was one of the original supporters of the Industrial Relations Act 1971, which proved to be so disastrous. He was also one of the men of the last Conservative Government who advised the right hon. Member for Sidcup (Mr.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 318</span>
Heath) to call that horrible general election in February 1974. But he seems to have learnt his lesson now.<br><br>
If the Secretary of State this morning is fighting off the extremists who have taken over the Conservative Government, we can forgive his absence for the moment. If that is what he is doing, perhaps he is doing better work there. But we are entitled to know the Government's intentions before this motion is passed.<br><br>
The most interesting articles have appeared in <i>The Daily Telegraph.</i> There was an article by Graham Turner, and the editorial yesterday was very interesting. It read:
<br><blockquote><p>"Tomorrow the Cabinet"—</p></blockquote>
that is, today—
<br><blockquote><p>"hopes to reach amendments on the Employment Bill now before the Commons…The Employment Secretary and those who share his view wish to do no more than seek to close the breach opened by the House of Lords in the MacShane case…The Chancellor of the Exchequer and his supporters would like to go much further in introducing legislation also to remove the immunities at present enjoyed by secondary strikes. The Cabinet is being daily numbered off into dove-like Priors and hawkish Howes."</p></blockquote>
What I find fascinating is that some people regard <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> as the official mouthpiece of the Conservative Party. The article concludes:
<br><blockquote><p>"…there is also a respectable case for leaving the law alone. It has not helped much up to now. It may be that, left to his own devices, this is what Mr. Prior would prefer to do…He has produced a narrow Bill…The Cabinet would be most unwise to continue with it as it stands."</p></blockquote>
Here we have <i>The Daily Telegraph,</i> totally committed to the Conservative Party, telling the country that perhaps the Government ought to drop the Bill. But the Under-Secretary tells us that we should make progress and proceed as fast as we can, though we do not even know what changes will come forward.<br><br>
An article by Graham Turner appeared in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> of 12 February. I shall not read the whole of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I might, if I am pressed.
<br><blockquote><p>"The Tory Cabinet now stands in danger of being split from top to bottom on the issue of trade union reform. It teetered on the brink after last week's Cabinet discussion. With Sir Geoffrey Howe's weekend attack on Jim Prior's 'softly, softly' approach to the unions, it has now gone over the brink."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0674">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 319</span>
The article goes on to explain that at last Friday's hour-long meeting under the Prime Minister's chairmanship, with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Employment present, they thought that they were agreed. Then the Chancellor of the Exchequer went off to the West Country and delivered a ferocious attack on the Secretary of State for Employment. What is more, he never discussed it. There is a procedure in Whitehall that, when Cabinet Ministers invade the territory of another Minister, at least they circulate speeches. That does not happen with this Government.<br><br>
What happened? The first that the Secretary of State for Employment learnt about his Cabinet colleague's disgraceful behaviour was when someone telephoned him at home on Saturday night after the speech had been delivered. That is disgusting behaviour. It demonstrates what chaos exists in this Conservative Government.
<br><blockquote><p>"The speech brought a sharp and instant reaction from some of Mr. Prior's backers in the Cabinet. Sir Geoffrey, said one, had not even been batting on his own wicket 'and when he was last on it, in 1971, look where he got to', a reference to the ill-fated Industrial Relations Act, of which Sir Geoffrey was a principal architect. Sir Geoffrey, he went on, was 'like a dog returning to his own vomit'; he just wanted to re-live 1971 and had learned nothing from having got it wrong then."</p></blockquote>
That demonstrates the utter confusion and chaos in the Government over this measure. Here the Under-Secretary tells us that we must press forward and get it on to the statute book as quickly as possible, because the country is crying out for it. Even the Cabinet does not know what it wants to do. Moreover, the dissension has now gone to the Back Benches. I have referred at previous sittings to the early-day motion. I hope that the Committee has noticed how names keep coming off that motion and how arm-twisting is taking place—"Please withdraw your name from the motion—let us not embarrass the Secretary of State even further." I do not know whether the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) has yet taken his name off.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He is immune from arm-twisting measures of that sort. But that is what is taking place. It has now reached the stage where there is dissension on the Back Benches. I hope that we shall hear
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 320</span>
some of that dissension in the Committee this morning.<br><br>
An interesting letter was drawn to my attention by my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster. The hon. Member for Carshalton (Mr. Forman) said in a letter to the editor of <i>The Times</i> on Tuesday:
<br><blockquote><p>"I believe you overestimate the effectiveness of law in curbing trade union power…Do you suppose, for example, that the removal of legal immunity from all secondary action or the recourse to trade union funds in damages would provide anything other than a militants' charter?…Do you suppose that the imposition by statute of a requirement for secret ballots in key internal decisions would be the best way to encourage the trade union rank and file to demand such procedures from their leaders?…Surely our experience with the ill-fated 1971 Industrial Relations Act"—</p></blockquote>
leads us to believe that
<br><blockquote><p>"tacit consent is what is really required."</p></blockquote>
10.45 am<br><br>
That is a Conservative Member of Parliament writing. I do not know what inspired him to write that to <i>The Times,</i> but there is a great deal of sense in it. We on this side of the Committee would agree with him.<br><br>
The Secretary of State is in extreme difficulty over the Bill. We are in difficulties, too, in the Committee. We are the people who have the responsibility of going through it line by line, and we are expected to take on face value the bland statement from the Under-Secretary that we should sit at 4.30 this afternoon and thereafter. I could make a long speech about how this would disrupt the work of hon. Members. We have duties to our constituents which are not confined to this Committee. We shall be excluded from taking part in many debates on the Floor of the House, some of us will be denied sitting on party committees, some of my hon. Friends are members of Select Committees and they have either to neglect this Committee or neglect the proceedings in those Committees. It is not satisfactory.<br><br>
We want to know something about the Government's timetable for all the changes which they will propose. As far as I can understand from all the leaking that is taking place within the Government, there will be a consultative document which will come out next week. Genuine consultations will take anything between four to six weeks. The TUC, the Confederation of British Industry, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0675">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 321</span>
British Institute of Management and everybody who has an interest must be consulted. The Department of Employment will then have to take account of that consultation and come forward with its proposals. That may take another two weeks.<br><br>
This is now put in commission to the Cabinet. The Secretary of State is not master in his own house. He cannot come forward on a departmental basis to lay these changes before this Committee. They have to be churned in to a Cabinet committee, presumably with the Chancellor of the Exchequer whooping up the hawks and then going off at weekends making terrible speeches and undermining the Secretary of State.<br><br>
On that basis, it will be another eight weeks before we see any changes. Since these changes have to be inserted in the Bill, what is this argument I hear from the Under-Secretary this morning that we must press ahead to get it on to the statute book? On their own reckoning, the Government do not hope to have the Bill on to the statute book until after Easter, probably late summer. It is totally fallacious to put forward that kind of argument. There are other comments I could make, but I do not wish to take up much more Committee time. In my judgment, we have made excellent progress so far on the clauses. In comparison with some measures before the House, we are doing pretty well. It is a relatively short Bill of 18 clauses. The Housing Bill has 129 clauses, the Local Government, Planning and Land Bill has 149 clauses, and neither Committee has started afternoon sittings yet. The Transport Bill has 57 clauses. None of those Bills is threatened with major changes. This is the only Bill before the House of Commons at the moment, produced eight weeks on Second Reading, that is now threatened with fundamental changes. We have a Cabinet divided in itself, not knowing where to take it.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary should tell us whether the Government intend to press ahead and bludgeon the Bill on to the statute book, in advance of their own timescale, or whether we are to take it the considered way. We are dealing with an extremely sensitive matter. If the Bill comes out of the Committee without the substantial amendments that we shall move, it will damage industrial relations
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 322</span>
seriously. It will have massive and catastrophic repercussions throughout the country. I hope, therefore, that before we let this motion pass, the Under-Secretary will at least be more forthcoming with the Committee, let us know the timescale, and tell us how he intends to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has made an entertaining speech, in which he told us of the various things he could say if he were to make a long speech. The implication was that he would not, but he went on to make it, about the disrupting of the work of hon. Members and so forth. What is being proposed however, is no more than this. Instead of sitting only in the morning on Tuesdays and Thursdays from half-past 10 until 1 o'clock, we should sit also during the afternoons. To describe that modest proposal as bludgeoning the Bill through is not a temperate or accurate use of the language.<br><br>
What the Government are saying is that this is plainly an important Bill. They are not saying that the Opposition have filibustered or wasted much time during our last six sittings, but plainly more time will be needed for the Committee to consider the provisions of this important Bill if we are to get it on to the statute book within a reasonable time.<br><br>
It is an important Bill. Therefore, the Government are inviting the Committee to sit during the afternoons—not to curtail discussion of it or to bludgeon the Bill through but to enable the Committee to allot itself more time to this important task.<br><br>
As my right hon. Friend made plain when he came to the Committee the other day, the Government propose a new clause, and they propose to give notice of their intentions by way of a consultation paper. That was made plain a fortnight or so ago. The Government will publish their proposals very shortly now, in the form of a consultation paper, and from that consultation paper will be made clear the nature of the changes that the Government believe to be necessary, in the interests of employees as much as of employers, to take account of the new interpretation given by the House of Lords in the MacShane case just before Christmas, after the Bill was published.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0676">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 323</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Giles Radice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary said that this new consultation document would come before us "very shortly". Could he tell us what "very shortly" means? Is it this week, next week, the week after, or the week after that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: "Very shortly" means very shortly. I would not wish to mislead the Committee by saying one day rather than another, but of two words in the English language used in apposition one to the other, it would be hard to find words simpler or more easily understood than "very" and "shortly". It is, of course, the Secretary of State's intention so soon as possible to make his proposals public. I can advise the Committee, as he assured it when he came here the other day, that the Committee will be the first to see those proposals. They will be made available very shortly, I believe that it will be possible for impatience to be contained.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman tell the Committee whether the Cabinet have agreed on what will go into the consultation paper, or will the term "very shortly" depend upon how long it will take the Cabinet to agree what will go into it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I were privy to the proceedings of the Cabinet to the extent that many perceptive journalists appear to be, I still should not feel myself able to answer the hon. Gentleman's question. I do not think that there is any ground for supposing that the Committee will have to wait long to know what is the Government's intention as to the nature of the new Clause, which is needed, in the view of the Government as a whole, to restrict to a more practical and less unjust scope the immunities which at present the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1976 confers upon a trade union organiser, who has only to say, so the Law Lords have said, "I genuinely believe that this action against a remote secondary employer will help me win my dispute with the employer with whom I am disputing". The Government believe that that must be very substantially restricted. That is the intention. It will be proposed in a new clause, and the proposals will be set out in a consultation paper very shortly.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 324</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that the Law Lords did not say that all the union official has to do is not to say that he believes that a particular course of action was in furtherance and so on, but to show that he genuinely believed it to be so?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not suppose that a union leader would often say that that was the case if he did not believe it, but the hon. Gentleman is perfectly right: it has to be a genuine belief. However, a very wide immunity at present exists. It is so wide that it is quite unworkable and quite unjust.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman asks me the Government's intentions. They are to press ahead with the Bill as fast as is reasonably practicable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. and learned Gentleman give an assurance to the Committee that nothing in this consultative document, and in the amendments which will come to us as a consequence of it, will affect the matters which we have already been considering within the Bill? I find it difficult to see how he could give that assurance. For instance, our next debate will be on clause 2 stand part on codes of practice, among other things—and we have already had reference to the code of practice on picketing. We are worried that matters will be put before us which reflect on things which we have already decided on in the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have been concerning ourselves so far with the first clause, which deals with the provision of public funds for ballots, and we are currently considering the clause which empowers the Secretary of State to draft and issue codes of practice—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Including picketing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Including picketing, certainly, if need be. The Government have given notice of their intention, if there cannot be a voluntary agreement, to issue a code of practice relating to picketing. I have made clear more than once that the intention of the new clause would be to restrict immunities. As my right hon. Friend said when he came to the Committee the other day, the clauses with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0677">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 325</span>
which we shall be dealing within the next week or two are not on the subject of that new clause.<br><br>
Therefore it is not, and would not be, the Government's intention to seek in some way to curtail the proper examination of the Bill which it is the duty of this Committee to give. Far from it. Our intention is to press ahead with what the right hon. Gentleman has described as quite a short Bill—which bears no comparison with the length of various other Bills which he mentioned—in a way which will permit the Committee to give proper and full consideration to each clause, subject to reasonable demands by the Government to ensure that their legislation reaches the statute book.<br><br>
I hope that I have been able to reassure right hon. and hon. Gentlemen that this is a motion that it is our duty to pass so that we may allow ourselves more time to give the Bill proper examination.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ron. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could we not put a different construction on the Under-Secretary's remarks? Taking into account what he said, should we not do something quite different? Here we have a short Bill of only 18 clauses representing the Government's considered thinking, but we all know that things have been happening outside to which, unfortunately, the hon. and learned Gentleman is not privy. I sympathise with him. We are all in the same position. We must seek guidance from leaks in the press.<br><br>
<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> has been mentioned. I have <i>The Guardian,</i> which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Cabinet rift comes out into the open. Chancellor's unvetted outburst angers the Cabinet doves."</p></blockquote>
Some of the newspapers tell us who the doves and the hawks are. Perhaps, if an outburst is vetted, it is all right, but this was an unvetted outburst, it seems from the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who ought to know better. I understand that he started his career as a lawyer working for the Transport and General Workers' Union. Perhaps he should have known better.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary says that the new clauses which will alter the Bill will come very shortly. We do not know what "very shortly" means. I think that, by the time
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 326</span>
the consultative document is issued, everybody has been consulted, and it is finally drafted and brought to us, it will probably take something like eight weeks. Therefore, is there not a case for saying that we should adjourn for eight weeks until we have the essence of the Bill?<br><br>
I say eight weeks. I do not know how long eight weeks is in the life of a nation. Is there such a rush? The Under-Secretary says that the country demands this Bill. I do not know. When I go round my constituency in East London, to the shopping centres, the housing estates, the pubs and so on, I do not hear that from everyone I meet. I find worries about mortgages or rents or rising prices. Not a soul has come to me and said "I demand that this Bill be rushed through the House of Commons in the next two or three days."<br><br>
Perhaps the Chancellor of the Exchequer says that in his outburst. Obviously Ministers mix with quite different people from those whom I meet. We all remember the Chancellor of the Exchequer as the architect of the 1971 Act. We all remember him as the architect of the European Communities Act 1972, and look what happened to that. I am not so sure that his advice is the advice to accept.<br><br>
I have read the unfortunate remarks in papers such as the <i>Daily Mail</i> and the <i>Daily Express.</i> Perhaps all the hysteria about the country demanding this and that is, as a previous Prime Minister once put it, something got up by the press. It is all got up by the hawks. It is certainly not something got up by ordinary people.<br><br>
I suggest to the hon. and learned Gentleman that the most sensible thing for us to do, instead of talking in the abstract and in a void, is to adjourn until he brings forward his proposals, which we can look at then.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not in the Committee for the first few minutes of the hon. and learned Gentleman's explanation of why the sittings motion was necessary, but I listened with care to his reply to my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley). The crux of his argument seems to be the need to act quickly to clarify the law and to restrict trade union immunities in the light of their Lordships' ruling in Express Newspapers v. MacShane. But, as my right
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0678">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 327</span>
hon. Friend had pointed out, and as my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) has just emphasised, the proposals which the Government apparently have in mind to clarify the law in that way are not yet available to the Committee, to the Government, to Parliament or to anybody else. They are not in the Bill, so what is the hurry to get the measures that we have before us through if the real urgency relates to something which is not yet in our possession?<br><br>
Indeed, as my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East has argued, common sense would suggest that we should proceed in the very opposite direction. The Under-Secretary did not challenge the hypothetical timetable that my right hon. Friend had in mind: the availability of the consultative document next week, a reasonable period of at least four or five weeks for an adequate consultation process to be gone through, perhaps after that a further week for those who will be more seriously affected to make further representations to the Government, then perhaps a week for the Government themselves to consider, in the light of those representations, how to proceed, and finally the printing and presentation to Parliament and the need for Parliament to have adequate time to consult and consider. That seems to me to cover about nine or 10 weeks. But in the mean-time we shall be asked to rush the present Bill through.<br><br>
Commonsense suggests that we should go slowly to allow the Bill still to be in Committee when the new clause or clauses are available so that we may then not only consider them in Committee and consider any amendments that we may deem to be necessary—that is, if we are unsuccessful in opposing what may be objectionable to us—and also to see the new clause in the context of the Bill as a whole.<br><br>
I share the anxiety which has already been expressed by my hon. Fiends that, because of our procedures, we may well be denied the right to revert to matters that we shall already have passed and which may well have an entirely different character and aspect in the light of whatever changes are proposed by the Government in the new clause.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman served on the Standing Committee on the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 328</span>
Employment Protection Bill in 1975. We all know the size of that measure and the extent to which it was equally far-reaching in its effect on industrial relations and on the law, yet we had not started on that Bill at the point when the present Minister is hoping that this Bill will have left Committee. If I recall correctly—I should have to check—we did not start our proceedings on that Bill until 8 May, and that was a considerably longer Bill than this. We did not have it out of Committee until mid-July.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman suggests that there is need for the present Bill to be got out of Committee to fit in with the requirements of the parliamentary programme. I ask him to bear in mind that we did not start the Employment Protection Bill until 8 May. It would not therefore be unreasonable if we were to tell the hon. and learned Gentleman that we should think about how we could get this Bill out of Committee some time in May. I speak entirely for myself—I do not know to what extent I reflect the views of my right hon. and hon. Friends—but if that other Bill, with all its length, its far-reaching consequences and its importance, could be handled at that time in the parliamentary programme, I see no justification for the hurry on this.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman talks about the country feeling that the law in this field requires change. I assume that he is thinking of the public assuming that the changes they have in mind will have some bearing on contemporary events.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my right hon. Friend aware that there is a school of thought that the reason for haste in getting the Bill out is to cover up the cracks appearing within the Tory Party? Is he aware, for instance, that on the Industry Bill last week there was a revolt of the Right wing on small businesses, and last night, on the Education (No. 2) Bill, there was a revolt of the Left wing on school transport? It is evident from the early-day motion tabled last week, which was critical of the Secretary of State and from which names are now disappearing, that the reason for haste was to try to get the Bill through while the Tory Party hangs together. All the evidence is that it is rapidly falling apart.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0679">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 329</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is doubtless right. He is shrewd and perceptive in these matters. No doubt, he has in mind the old saying "We must hang together, gentlemen, or otherwise we shall hang separately." But I do not intend to be persuaded by my hon. Friend to become involved in the ornithological talk about different kinds of birds, caged or otherwise, hawks or doves, save to say that I have noticed the extraordinary things going on the Order Paper of the House. It seems that internal battles in the Conservative Party and the Government are being fought out on the Order Paper by those who are induced to put their names to bellicose early-day motions and are then gradually persuaded by heaven knows what process—perhaps the withholding of some dangled honour or the lure of a parliamentary delegation to distant sunny parts, all at the disposal of the Whips—to remove their names from these motions.<br><br>
The Committee and Parliament will form their own judgment about that. But my hon. Friend is right when he suggests that what is going on has much more to do with the morale of the Conservative Party and the Government and the need to bring together things which are coming apart at the seams than it has to do with the reality of events in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend considered that one of the reasons why Tory Back Benchers are looking so dejected and walking with bowed heads may be that they are afraid to look up because of all the hawks and doves flying overhead?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. and learned Friend has in mind the interesting correspondence that has been going on in <i>The Times</i> about pigeons or seagulls dropping fish and various other things.<br><br>
I return to what the Committee and the Bill should be primarily concerned with—the relationship between law and good industrial relations. The hon. and learned Gentleman lifted the veil a little on what we might have before us. It is interesting that, although he denies knowledge of what goes on in the Cabinet, he was nevertheless able to tell us what the new clause would be aimed to do—to limit the immunities of trade unions. Even if we had it—we do not have it, and it looks
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 330</span>
as if we shall not have it for weeks—does he expect the country to believe that it will have a significant influence on the conduct of industrial relations?<br><br>
If the Bill had these new proposals embodied within it and if it were already on the statute book, would it have made the slightest difference to what has happened at the firm of Hadfields this morning, as I understand it from the news? I make no comment on the behaviour of those involved and whether they should have done what they did—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. and learned Gentleman wishes to lure me along the line that he has taken and to discuss the merits of the 1906, 1974 and 1976 Acts, I shall happily respond.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Lyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the behaviour of pickets. Would the right hon. Gentleman like to comment on that:</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that apparently one of the parliamentary zombies has managed to shake himself from his slumbers. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to discuss the conduct of pickets, I shall happily do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It would be dangerous to embark on a debate on certain parts of the Bill at this stage, no matter how tempting. The right hon. Gentleman was fully in order until he was tempted by the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Lyell). Perhaps we can get back to the motion before us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to give way to the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South-West (Mr. Page).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall bow to your injunction Mr. Leadbitter. I wished only to ask the right hon. Gentleman, if he were to make any comments, would he please express sympathy with the policeman who was injured on the picket line today?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must insist. There is plenty to do on the Bill. When we come to the appropriate part of it, hon. Members will be able to use all their ingenuity and whatever time is available
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0680">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 331</span>
to them to expound on those matters in which the hon. Member is currently interested. We are at the moment dealing with a sittings motion.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Leadbitter, and of course I shall respect it. It was the Minister himself who raised the question of the matters to which the new clause would be directed. I think that you will agree that, in considering whether the Bill's progress should be speeded up or whether more time should be allocated to us it is proper to hypothesise about matters which the Minister says are relevant reasons for accelerating the progress.<br><br>
I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman to recall the words of the Secretary of State, as I recall them, when he was interviewed in a radio programme some weeks ago and was questioned about the possible relevance of the Bill and what may be in it when enacted to contemporary industrial relations, specifically with regard to the steel dispute. If I recall correctly, he said that he would not have wanted to have this Bill enacted at the present time because there might be those who would look to it as a remedy for some of the things currently happening and because the difficulties that would then arise would discredit his Bill. That was the gist of his line. He did not want the Bill at the present time, because it might be put to too early a test, which it might fail. He wanted to proceed slowly with these matters.<br><br>
To that extent, I think that the Secretary of State is sensible. Of course, this is a field where people seeking to introduce change—whether we accept or reject that change is another matter—ought to proceed slowly and cautiously. Haste should be their very last guide. I say that with some feeling because of my own experiences. One or two scars are still unhealed, I must confess.<br><br>
It makes sense for us to proceed slowly and steadily. The hon. and learned Gentleman has not provided us so far with one good reason why we should do otherwise. I ask him to think of how we proceeded with the Employment Protection Bill and the fact that, notwithstanding its length, without any late sittings at night—we sat in the evenings, but I do
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 332</span>
not think we sat beyond 11 o'clock on any night—we were able to get that easily on to the statute book.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is there not a danger in taking the course advocated by the hon. and learned Gentleman that, because of the disarray and indecision in the Tory Cabinet, it is possible that this new measure may never be produced at all? The Government may have second thoughts or even third thoughts. In which case, we, being anxious to co-operate and make short speeches, should have got the Bill through the Committee, there would be no other proposal coming forward, and those of us anxious to serve on other Committees might find ourselves elsewhere and not able to consider something which might come out as a result of a fourth thought. This is a great danger.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In my speech on Second Reading I said that one thing the Government had learnt from their unhappy experience in 1971 was the importance of presentation and timing when proceeding with such delicate and controversial matters as those before the Committee. I pointed our that, unlike the Industrial Relations Act, which was a massive package, these matters are being taken step by step. This Bill is only one of a series. As I understand it, we are not only to have the new clause or clauses which will be an addition to this Bill, but at some time later in the year there is to be a Green Paper which will include yet more matters and measures.<br><br>
That, is something which, for obvious reasons, we have not touched on so far, but I do not see how the Committee can ignore it. My hon. and learned Friend, when he makes that point, ought to bear in mind that we, and the trade union movement, are being subjected to what may be termed salami tactics—slice by slice—if we let the Government get away with it. I do not want to take up unnecessary time, but I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will reflect carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend mentioned the Green Paper. Will he agree that it is perfectly possible that, when we know the area which that Green Paper is intended to cover, which I presume will be announced at the same time as the consultative document is disclosed—the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0681">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 333</span>
Under-Secretary may throw some light on that—we may well want to argue within the Committee, at some point that the matters which we are discussing would be better left to be covered by that further legislation, or that further Green Paper. Once again, we are in a difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is wholly reasonable. If the Government intend to proceed with further legislation on this subject later in the year, it seems wholly reasonable to suggest that they leave the pieces that they want to tack on to the Bill for inclusion in their later proposals, when everybody can look at them and consider them with care and caution and have the full discussion that is so obviously important.<br><br>
I fear that the hon. and learned Gentleman will not be swayed by that, but what he ought to take full account of is the point we have made about the importance of seeing the new clauses before the Bill is out of Committee. I have shown that there is adequate time in the parliamentary timetable in the light of our previous experience of legislation on these matters, and the dates of introduction. The hon. and learned Gentleman has put an inadequate case for changing our proceedings at this stage to sit extended hours in the afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman said that he hoped to get the Bill through Committee in a reasonable time. Before we pass the motion, we ought to know what that reasonable time is. It is customary before a Committee meets for the Whips on both sides to meet, the Government Whip often confides to the Opposition Whip that they want to get the Bill through in eight, 10, or 12 sittings, and so on. Although the Opposition invariably protest that the time is not enough, the Government's intention is known.<br><br>
I understand that there has been no meeting of our Whips with the Whips on the Government side to say how long the Committee is expected to go on. It is an affront to the Committee for us to go on from day to day not knowing what is in the Government's mind.<br><br>
What is meant by "reasonable time"? I do not want a lawyer's reply. I want to know what is reasonable and what is unreasonable. No doubt, the hon. and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 334</span>
learned Gentleman would consider it unreasonable if the Bill sank into the sands, continued until the recess, and never reached the Floor of the House again. That would be unreasonable. If he says "a reasonable time", one presumes that he has in mind before Easter, after Easter, some time in July—there must be some date in the Government's mind by which they want to finalise the Bill.<br><br>
I can understand the difficulties. The Cabinet is split from top to bottom, it does not know what sort of amendments to bring forward, and we do not know whether the amendments will be so controversial that the Bill will go on longer than expected. Nevertheless, it is an affront to the Committee to ask us to pass a sittings motion when we do not know, first, whether it is necessary, and we do not know what other time will be necessary because we lack information on the new clauses to enable us to come to a conclusion on whether we should concede this to the Government or not.<br><br>
It might have been better if the sittings motion had been postponed until we knew what was in the Cabinet's mind. No doubt, some acrimonious discussions are going on at the moment between the peaceful Priors and hawkish Chancellors as to the appropriate wording of an amendment. We are all standing with bated breath, waiting for the next blow to be delivered at the solar plexus of the trade union movement.<br><br>
I hope that we shall not pass this sittings motion unless we have a definite reply. I am quite serious, and I hope that the Under-Secretary will pay attention to this. We want a definite reply on what he means by "reasonable". Can he spell out the timetable? Otherwise, he is asking us to vote for something which we may not consider necessary. If he wants to reach agreement with this side of the Committee, it is up to him to spell out the timetable and let us know when he expects the Bill to leave the Committee and go to the Floor of the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has been an entertaining and instructive debate, though I am not sure that it has been entirely valuable. I wish to make clear once again why the Government believe that this Committee should allow itself rather more time than our initial sittings motion would permit to consider this important Bill. I am
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0682">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 335</span>
beginning to wonder whether the Opposition are sincere when they tell us how fundamentally important the Bill is, because I should have thought it hard to justify to their constituents, as indeed it would be to ours, that we should continue to deal with a Bill of the great significance that they contend it has—and they are right—on a basis of Tuesday morning and Thursday morning sittings only.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) invited us to compare the progress of this Bill with that of the Employment Protection Bill in 1975, and I am very content to do so. As he told us—I confess I do not have these dates inscribed upon the tablets of my heart, or even in my diary—it began on 8 May and was finished by the end of July. That was a Bill of no fewer than 128 clauses and 17 schedules, and it was taken through Committee in two and a half months.<br><br>
I have already made the calculation as to the length of time this Bill would take us on current rates of progress of two clauses in six sittings. It would take us 28 more weeks. It is precisely this point that the right hon. Gentleman, with his usual eloquence, makes in support of my argument that we must accelerate our progress. We could not justify to the country taking 28 weeks over an 18-clause Bill, with a couple of schedules, whereas two and a half months was all that was needed to deal with the vastly greater Employment Protection Bill in 1975.<br><br>
I have come to think that eight weeks is not a long time in the course of a speech in Standing Committee. One hon. Member said that eight weeks is not a long time in the life of a nation. To suggest that we should adjourn for eight weeks, or indeed at all, in order to await the consultation paper or the new clause—or, it was even suggested, the Green Paper—although entertaining is not practical politics.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
I have been greatly entertained by the imaginative and speculative reflections upon relationships in the Cabinet I can only repeat that the proposals which will very shortly be published in the form of a consultation paper are, and will be, the proposals of the Government as a whole. When all this talk goes on of the hawks and the doves, with much relish, in particular from the right hon. Member from
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 336</span>
Doncaster, I sometimes wonder whether he is overlooking what has led to so much of the trouble that confronts the country, and which I say sincerely and frankly confronts the Government as well.<br><br>
I have in mind the 1976 Act of which the right hon. Gentleman was so influential an architect and so eloquent an advocate. It was that Act which enlarged the immunities in a sense that we foretold would prove to be disastrously impracticable and unjust. That Act, which the House of Lords is now interpreting for the first time, has led to a wide extension, including the extension of immunity for pickets.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Much as I should like to do so, I am reluctant to be drawn into a discussion of the merits of the 1976 Act or any other Act, save to point out to the hon. and learned Gentleman that the change in the 1976 Act was recommended by the Donovan commission, which spent three years looking at these matters. We have referred to that report already in Committee, and will no doubt do so again, with respect amounting to reverence.<br><br>
The specific change that the Government are now aiming to modify in the new clauses that we may expect was entirely in accordance with the recommendations of Lord Donovan and his colleagues. As they and many other commentators since have observed, it was aimed as much as anything at putting the law back to what it was believed and understood to be in the 1906 Act.<br><br>
When the hon. and learned Gentleman refers again to the question of immunities and the need to change them, will he let us know precisely which changes he thinks necessary so that we may consider them and compare them with the recommendations and reasoning of Lord Donovan? If they merely seek to revert to the law as it was before the 1976 Act, we are right back in all the difficulties described by the Royal commission which made it necessary for us to change the law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not go more than one sentence into the Donovan report. The right hon. Gentleman knows that that recommendation by the Donovan commission went hand in hand and in harness with a recommendation for a system of registration which was rejected by the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0683">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 337</span>
right hon. Gentleman and his Government.<br><br>
I think that I have said enough to justify the Government's motion. We must get on. We cannot dawdle along, entertaining though it is—perhaps not "dawdle along" but take so little a proportion of the time available to the Committee as we are at the moment. There is a demand in the country for the Bill to be on the statute book. The polls show us that there is a strong demand from a great majority of trade union members to get these proposals on to the statute book—78 per cent. or 82 per cent. Polls taken among trade union members alone show that there is a demand for this to be on the statute book. I ask the Committee to meet that strong expression of opinion by extending the consideration that it is prepared to give to this Bill from the mornings into the afternoons.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman is quoting the polls and telling us how important they are in what the country is thinking. Is he aware that the far more significant story that the polls are telling us is that his Government are highly unpopular? If what he says is right the Government should resign forthwith.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is evidence of unpopularily because the Bill, is not on the statute book already. To the extent that there is merit in that criticism, we are seeking to ensure that it gets on as soon as is reasonably practicable.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Employment Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful for right hon. and hon. Gentlemen to know that because of the regular meetings of the 1922 Committee in this room on Thursday afternoons, our sittings this afternoon, and on all subsequent Thursday afternoons, will be held in Committee Room 9. There need be no question here of the need to employ secondary pickets, but in order that we may proceed in a manner which will be helpful to all
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 338</span>

<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
ISSUE BY SECRETARY OF STATE OF CODES OF PRACTICE.</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Lead-bitter, for giving us that information—that we are to be evicted by the 1922 Committee. As far as I am concerned, the 1922 Committee may have this room on Tuesday morning, Tuesday afternoon, Thursday afternoon and Thursday evening because I think that the sittings motion is very unsatisfactory.<br><br>
I want to register our objections to the unsatisfactory nature of clause 2. We have demonstrated that we have misgivings about the provisions, and there was a time during the discussions on the amendments when perhaps we could have made the clause more acceptable. However, quite foolishly, the Under-Secretary refused to accept any of the amendments moved by my hon. Friends.<br><br>
At present, the only body empowered to issue codes is ACAS—and it has already issued three. ACAS is totally independent. I can recommend the codes to any Members of the Committee who have not had a chance to look at them. One covers disciplinary practice and procedures in employment, the second time off for trade union duties and activities and the third disclosure of information to trade unions for collective bargaining purposes. Those codes have an extremely good reputation within industry. They resulted from discussions in ACAS. Under the clause the Secretary of State can amend any subsequent codes that ACAS brings forward, and there is a great danger that the codes issued either by the Secretary of State or by ACAS, will be suspect. People who now regard ACAS, and the codes that it produces as being utterly independent and extremely valuable, because of the representative nature of that body, will say that this is all changed. They will question its independence because of the provisions that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0684">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 339</span>
were taken by the Secretary of State in the Employment Act 1980, as it will become.<br><br>
We could perhaps, be a little more relaxed about the procedure if we were giving these powers to the right hon. Member for Lowestoft (Mr. Prior). But we are not. We are giving these powers to the Secretary of State for Employment. I do not know how long the present Secretary of State for Employment will remain in his job. There could be changes, as my hon. Friends have said. The right hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Sir K. Joseph) could be Secretary of State for Employment. That would send shudders down the spines of most people and would frighten to death the officials in the Department of Employment. Other Members of the Cabinet who do not take an enlightened view on these matters could be made Secretary of State. In paragraph 13 of the July working paper the Secretary of State said:
<br><blockquote><p>"…The Government propose that legislation should provide a power for the Secretary of State himself to draw up a code covering all aspects of picketing. The code would have status in law in that it could be taken into account in court proceedings. As a document approved by Parliament it could be expected to have considerable moral force, as well as helping to bring about a more consistent interpretation of the law by police and magistrates."</p></blockquote>
In paragraph 14 of that paper the Secretary of State dangled before the public the following words:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State would, however, intend to make use of the power to draw up a code only in the absence of comprehensive and effective voluntary guidance."</p></blockquote>
We need to know how the Government hope to use such powers if they are inserted in the Bill. I understand the Secretary of State is also considering codes of practice on the closed shop, union membership agreements and the press. Some of my hon. Friends will want to probe that prospect more deeply. If the Secretary of State believes that a code will give more guidance to the police and magistrates, then he must have something in mind.<br><br>
In previous debates the Under-Secretary said that he could not go into the codes and that he would not expect the Government to issue codes before the Committee had debated this clause and it had become law. I bet that within the deeper recesses of the Department of Employment there is already a draft code
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 340</span>
on picketing. That is a proper contingency measure. Officials will have been beavering away at that for weeks. It is fair to ask the Under-Secretary what he has in mind.<br><br>
He also said that he would draw up a code only in the absence of comprehensive and effective voluntary guidance. Again we want to know what he has in mind. What does he mean by "comprehensive and effective voluntary guidance"? The codes will have semi-legal status and they will be used in evidence in court.<br><br>
Will the Minister definitely produce a code on picketing? I took the Secretary of State to mean as much on Second Reading. The working papers said that ACAS might draw up a code. Will that be a runner? For example, is the code on picketing something which the Government will do wholly independently after discussions with ACAS, or have the Government in mind to put the whole matter back to ACAS if they want to produce a code with a modicum of respectability? I know that ACAS does not wish to produce a code on picketing, but the Government, knowing what dynamite it is, might want to give that responsibility back to ACAS.<br><br>
What are the Government's views on the TUC's guide on picketing? The Under-Secretary has that guide in his folder, I have seen him thumbing through it on more than one occasion. The code produced by the TUC last February on picketing, was extremely worthwhile. Perhaps the Under-Secretary will tell us what he thinks about it. Paragraph 9 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The purposes of picketing are to persuade other employees to join in the withdrawal of labour; to dissuade workers recruited by the employer during a strike from entering the strikebound premises or to establish check points to ensure that no strikers return prematurely. Picketing may also be aimed at deflecting supplies or custom from the employer in dispute. The decision to mount a picket is for the union in dispute. Unions should in general, and save in exceptional circumstances, confine picketing to the premises of the parties to the dispute or the premises of suppliers and customers of those parties."</p></blockquote>
The TUC drew up that guide voluntarily last winter just before the general election. As I have often said, the best regulation for the trade unions is self-regulation. Have the government discussed the TUC guides, particularly its guide on picketing, with the members of the general council, or do they intend to brush it aside? Are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0685">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 341</span>
they serious about trying to work out a voluntary code? If they are, they should certainly pick that up.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
The Under-Secretary on a previous occasion said that a proposed Government code on picketing would be a guide to the police. Such a code could be extremely difficult for the ordinary constable on the beat to enforce when trying to restore order in the picket line. Most picketing is peaceful. There is plenty of evidence of that, and I do not think that it is in dispute. Occasionally there are outbreaks. The official union organisers and the police then get together and calm the situation. Reference has been made this morning to Hadfield's in Sheffield. I listened to the Ten o'clock news, and heard that difficulties that occurred early in the morning had been contained.<br><br>
We should try to allay the fears of the TUC about such codes. The TUC has produced a booklet. Clause 14, paragraph 48 on page 11 of that booklet states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Besides seeking to outlaw so-called 'secondary' pickets, the provision also seeks to prohibit 'outsiders' joining picket lines (with the exception of an official accompanying his member at a 'lawful picket'). This is fraught with legal problems. Trade union officers who attend at picket lines when their own members are not directly concerned and trades councils' secretaries would be among those liable to be labelled as unlawful pickets."</p></blockquote>
The Under-Secretary shakes his head, but we are entitled to know if the TUC's view is right. Paragraph 50 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Pickets are already highly vulnerable to being charged with a range of criminal offences but this proposed provision will add a very substantial further restriction and may also lead to an increase in criminal prosecutions. It is easy to imagine circumstances where police officers ask pickets if they work at the place being picketed; and if they do not and refuse to move, the police may initiate prosecutions for obstruction."</p></blockquote>
That means that the criminal law would be involved.<br><br>
Do the Government intend to produce a code on picketing which specifies that only 10 pickets, for example, are satisfactory outside a works gate. It will be a dickens of a job to decide how to do that, because there are several gates in some factories and large industrial complexes.<br><br>
Will he determine how many pickets under this code may go on every gate? If the Secretary of State decides on 10 or
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 342</span>
five to a gate and in the event there are 11 or 12, what guidance will he give the police? Will they say, "All right, you should not be here, go away,"? If they refuse to go away, will they be hauled before the courts?<br><br>
Such delicate situations could arise as a result of the Secretary of State taking powers to produce codes. Unless he is extremely careful, instead of the relative peace and harmony that pervades most picket lines we may find that every picket will take place in a highly-charged atmosphere with marches and demonstrations. Before we agree to let the clause stand part of the Bill, we should like to hear more from the Under-Secretary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Madel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) that most picketing is peaceful and that some unions are to be highly commended for the work that they do to ensure that. I have in mind—and this has been mentioned many times in the Committee—that in the 1974 miners' dispute the NUM were extremely strict and careful to see that picketing was carried out within the law, that there were not large numbers of pickets and that those not involved in the dispute and who were not employees of the coal board were kept out. There is no disagreement on that, although we should both admit that there have been occasions on which picketing has been violent, which is a breach of the criminal law.<br><br>
We entirely accept that the Opposition must give each clause a thorough combing. They were looking in clause 1 for a sign that ballots would be mandatory. They found that not to be the case, and it was helpful that the clause went through without a Division. On this clause the anxiety is that, somehow or other, ACAS will be undermined or that there will be conflict between the Secretary of State and ACAS on the drafting of codes.<br><br>
Subsection (2) provides that the Secretary of State shall have consultation with ACAS before he prepares and publishes a draft code. Subsection (3), which is equally important, provides that:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State shall consider any representations made to him about a draft prepared under subsection (2) above and may modify the draft accordingly."</p></blockquote></span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 343</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member said that we allowed clause 1 to go through uncontested. That is true. It underlines that we have taken a constructive attitude. But was that not because the Government admitted that their drafting was defective in the use of the word "employee", for example, instead of "trade union representative" or something like that? They accepted some of our arguments about "committee of management" and said that they would redraft that. There is no such possibility on clause 2, so there is a difference.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Madel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There may be redrafting, but one great anxiety was whether there was any power hidden in clause 1 under which the Government could order trade unions to have ballots on certain matters. That, as my hon. and learned Friend has said many times, was not the case.<br><br>
At our last sitting the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We believe, for all the reasons that we have advanced previously, that the Service is still the right body to produce codes of practice. We have reaffirmed that, and we shall no doubt do so again."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 12 February, 1979; c. 265.]</p></blockquote>
The right hon. Member for Chesterfield drew attention to the three codes that ACAS has produced on disciplinary practice and procedures in employment, disclosure of information and time off for trade union activities. But we must, in passing, point out how ACAS actually produces a code and what it has to go through in order to do it. It is a pretty comprehensive and careful system. In its annual report for 1976 ACAS says that, in drafting the codes, it takes account
<br><blockquote><p>"of current practice as well as the views of interested bodies. Before the publication of each of the draft consultative codes the Service conducts a series of studies in order that it might be informed of the major issues. The publication of the drafts facilitates a wide measure of consultation. All the comments are carefully considered…the final code aims to be broadly acceptable as a guide to conduct in its area. Following approval by the ACAS Council"—</p></blockquote>
I stress that approval by the council—
<br><blockquote><p>"the codes are submitted to the Secretary of State for Employment to be laid before Parliament."</p></blockquote>
We know what the composition of the council is. There is a full-time chairman, Mr. Mortimer, for whom I have great respect for all he has done and continues to do, and there are nine part-time members, three TUC, three CBI and three
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 344</span>
independent members. It is not stretching the imagination too far to point out that there are bound to be occasions when, quite frankly, they simply cannot agree to publish a code. That is part of the history if industrial relations in this country. It is a fact that we seem not to be able to proceed with sufficient participation as other countries do.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Chesterfield drew attention to the TUC commentary on the Employment Bill. He mentioned paragraph 5 on page 3: were it says that
<br><blockquote><p>"ACAS is the only body empowered to issue codes of practice…and ACAS has indicated that it would not wish to issue a code on picketing."</p></blockquote>
That does not surprise me. It would be difficult for the council to give its approval, as said in the 1976 report, before it could agree a particular code.<br><br>
That is not a criticism of ACAS. It is one of its difficulties. The things that ACAS does that I particularly like and want to see it do more often are contained in sections 3 to 5 of the 1975 Act. Section 3 refers to what ACAS can do about arbitration, section 4 refers to advice—I shall come back to that in a minute and section 5 refers to an inquiry. I do not criticise ACAS, but how I wish that months ago ACAS had done what it can do under section 5, which is to inquire into any question relating to industrial relations generally or to industrial relations in a particular industry and I would obviously mention the steel industry. If we had had a proper inquiry going months back, it might have been helpful in the current difficulties.<br><br>
All I am saying in discussing this matter of who shall issue the codes is that, if the Secretary of State, whoever he or she may be, issued a code of practice that ACAS did not like, ACAS would be empowered under section 4 of the 1975 Act to issue advice at the request of the employers or the employees on any matter concerned with industrial relations. Subsection (2) of section 4 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Service may publish general advice on any matter concerned with industrial relations or employment policies."</p></blockquote>
If any Secretary of State issued a code of practice which was not helpful and was causing trouble, without reference to the Secretary of State ACAS could trigger off clause 4 of the 1975 Act and give advice. If ACAS said that it had looked at that code of practice and, in its view, it did
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0687">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 345</span>
not improve industrial relations and that it would publish the reasons why, would any Secretary of State for Employment continue with the code or fail to modify it? I do not think he would.<br><br>
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Radice) is not here because, if there is one matter that we have to discuss more and more as this Parliament goes on, it is the whole question of industrial democracy and participation. That, in my view, is a right target for the Secretary of State to issue a code of practice. But bearing in mind the 1976 annual report of ACAS, I do not believe that the council could agree. Therefore, the Secretary of State will be able to publish a code of practice on industrial democracy and participation under clause 2 of the Bill, and, if it is so bad or carelessly drafted or unhelpful, along ACAS may come under section 4 of the 1975 Act, give advice and say "We do not think that this will do."<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
I understand the Opposition's anxiety that ACAS and the Secretary of State can now run these codes of practice together and that there could be difficulties. But I draw their attention to the 1975 Act and to the other powers that ACAS has.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is confirming what I said in our discussion on an earlier amendment when I was seeking to avoid the conflict with which clause 2 is pregnant. The hon. Gentleman is not only confirming that but it seems to me that he is welcoming it. I was astonished to hear the Under-Secretary grunting in support of his statement that, if ACAS disapproves of a particular code that the Secretary of State has issued, it can advise those to whom the code will apply accordingly. That is the daftness that we were tilting at earlier and seeking to avoid. But apparently the hon. Gentleman welcomes it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Madel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not a matter of welcoming it. It is recognising a fact. The 1975 Act is not being changed in section 4, so ACAS may give general advice. Because of its composition, ACAS will not be able to agree to publish codes of practice on certain matters. One of these
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 346</span>
is picketing, and one, I suggest, is industrial democracy and participation. Should we therefore sit back and fold our arms and say that we cannot proceed because ACAS cannot agree? I do not think that we should.<br><br>
I believe that clause 2 is carefully drafted, and will be helpful, and there is the safety catch that if the Secretary of State—whoever he or she may be—is publishing codes of practice which ACAS considers are not helping, it can use section 4; they can be amended and we can all proceed in a perfectly orderly manner. That is why I commend the clause to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary have both made clear that one of the codes of practice to be issued under the clause will be concerned with the closed shop and the freedom of the press. It is on that point that I wish to make a short contribution.<br><br>
Throughout the debates on this clause, we have been inhibited by the refusal of the Government to give any indication of what will be in the codes of practice on this or on any other subject. If I make certain assumptions on the basis of what has been said on the closed shop and the freedom of the press by right hon. and hon. Gentlemen over a number of years, I am filled with apprehension.<br><br>
What I am about to say is based on a long experience in journalism. I worked at the trade of journalism for over 30 years before coming to the House. I was a branch secretary of the National Union of Journalists for over 20 years and attended 25 successive annual conferences of that union and served on its appeals tribunal for many years. It is from that background that I now speak.<br><br>
In the editorial departments of the newspaper industry there is another organisation called the Institute of Journalists, which is somewhat older than the union. If the institute had ever adequately represented working journalists in the matter of wages and conditions, it is very likely that the union would never have needed to be formed. But the institute has always held itself rather aloof from the hurly-burly of trade union life, although it is in a legal sense a trade union. It is not affiliated to the TUC, and it represents a very small minority of working
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0688">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 347</span>
journalists. The vast majority—30,000—are represented by the NUJ.<br><br>
The point I stress is that, throughout the whole of the time that I worked in that industry, I never saw even one example of an NUJ closed shop threatening or damaging in any way the freedom of the press. If anyone can give me examples, I should like to hear them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The <i>Hendon Times.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am quite happy to give way if the hon. Gentleman cares to describe it. He does not.<br><br>
Before 1971 a large number of closed shops were operating in the editorial departments—perhaps not as many as on the printing side but certainly a large number. One of the biggest in the old days was in the Kemsley organisation. The Kemsley Press, before it became part of Thomson, was one of the biggest groups and controlled about a quarter of all the provincial evening and morning newspapers published in this country. A complete 100 per cent. closed shop operated throughout Kemsley.<br><br>
One incident occurred a good many years ago in Sheffield Newspapers, which was part of the Kemsley group, at a time when the editorial director was serving his year of office as president of the institute and sought to appoint two new subeditors, one of whom was a member of his institute. They were of course welcomed at the subs' table and as a matter of course invited to produce their union cards. When the subs discovered that they were not members of a union, they downed pencils.<br><br>
It was a rather bitter pill for the president of the institute to have to swallow, to tell his member that he could not after all start work on Sheffield Newspapers. The other man joined the union and the paper was duly produced. There was no meeting, there were no ballots, it was simply a matter of sensible organisation within the office.<br><br>
Hon. Gentlemen on the Government side may say that that was a terrible denial of the liberty of the member of the institute concerned. I say that it was not. It was a defence of the liberty of the majority, a case of working men and women defending their right not to work with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 348</span>
someone who was a member of an organisation which was setting out to undermine their bargaining position. That seems to me to be a perfectly proper position for anyone to take up.<br><br>
The closed shop is about the defence of the rights of the majority. I always understood that in a democracy the will of the majority is supposed to prevail. If the will of the majority is that there should be a closed shop within a particular industry, factory or office, the minority should, in my view, accept that decision.<br><br>
Let us look for a moment at the meaning of the freedom of the press. There are many different interpretations, and mine may not be the same as that of hon. Gentlemen opposite.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I presume that the hon. Member is about to use the example of the freedom of the press to relate his argument in some way to the industrial relations matters covered in clause 2(1). It is there stated that in this clause we are considering the question of codes of practice which the Secretary of State might think fit
<br><blockquote><p>"for the purpose of promoting the improvement of industrial relations".</p></blockquote>
Provided that his example is related to that, the hon. Gentleman may proceed, as long as he is aware that we must come back to the nub of the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to you, Mr. Leadbitter. I am seeking to show that there should not be a provision in this Bill for the Secretary of State to produce a code of practice relating to the closed shop and the freedom of the press. The Government, as I have already pointed out, have clearly indicated that they intend to do that under clause 2(1). The National Union of Journalists, in its evidence to the first Royal commission on the press—you will be aware that it is the only industry that has had the benefit of three Royal commissions since the war—said that the freedom of the press as it was then in operation was the freedom of a handful of financially powerful men to ensure that their views were on every breakfast table in Britain. That view was supported by the late Lord Beaverbrook. When asked what his motives were in owning newspapers, he said "To make propaganda and no other reason".<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0689">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 349</span>
Freedom of the press in this country is certainly not the freedom of journalists to write what they wish. I am very much afraid that when we finally see the code of practice which the Secretary of State will produce on this subject, it will be based on false assumptions assumptions, for instance, that there is at the moment freedom for journalists to write as they wish. In fact heavy censorship is exercised by the proprietors. Every publication receives more material than it can possibly print. The question is what to leave out. Anyone who imagines that the decision on what to leave out is not influenced by the political orientation of the proprietor is extremely naive.<br><br>
One of the greatest dangers to the freedom of the press is the creation of monopolies. Twenty years ago in the streets of my constituency anyone could buy one of three evening newspapers. Now there is only one. This is the story throughout the country. At the time that the second evening newspaper in Glasgow was closed down, there was not one city in Britain outside London where more than one evening newspaper was published. This has been the story of the last 30 years.<br><br>
The freedom of the reader to choose has been reduced almost to nothing throughout most of the country by commercial decisions of proprietors, not by the introduction of the closed shop. It was not printers and journalists who brought this position about. They have seen their jobs disappear by the thousand. If anyone suggests that the closed shop is inhibiting or restricting freedom, he is absolutely wrong. The freedom has been taken away by decisions of newspaper proprietors to create monopolies in the interests of maximising profits.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Needham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member agree that part of the restriction of choice is due to the great difficulty of making money in newspapers, because of the problems of disputes and demarcation that are so rife within the industry, and because of the failure of industrial relations to produce an effective, well-organised and profitable base?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Member is tempted to respond, I suggest that it would be a mistake to do so in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 350</span>
this debate. That wide field of consideration might be of interest elsewhere, but not here this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for you guidance, Mr. Leadbitter I should have been happy to reply now, but perhaps we can deal with it at a later stage when considering repealing the requirement to produce a press charter.<br><br>
The one organisation which has consistently opposed closures of newspapers and consistently upheld the freedom of the press is the National Union of Journalists. It would be grossly unfair if restrictions were placed on that union's right to organise by any code of practice issued by the Secretary of State on the ground that he was defending the freedom of the press. That is the burden of what I am trying to say.<br><br>
The NUJ has a code of conduct which it enforces rigorously upon its members, paragraph 2 of which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"A journalist shall at all times defend the principle of the freedom of the press and other media in relation to the collection of information and the expression of comment and criticism. He/she shall strive to eliminate distortion, news suppression and censorship."</p></blockquote>
That is part of the rules of the union. I know of no similar rule that binds the organisations of newspaper proprietors. That rule is enforced. During my many years on the appeals tribunal, there were many appeals by members against disciplinary action taken against them for breaches of the code of conduct. It would be outrageous to suggest that the NUJ, by organising working journalists within an office to the point of 100 per cent. membership, would in some way threaten the freedom of the press.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
I was disturbed to hear that the Secretary of State has so far met representatives of the NUJ on this matter on one occasion for one hour and has apparently made clear that that is all the consultation that he will have with that union at this stage. That is disgraceful. That union represents 30,000 people whose vital interests both as journalists and as trade unionists will be profoundly affected by a code of conduct on the lines which have been indicated. It is appalling that the Secretary of State feels that one hour's consultation with the representatives of those people
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0690">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 351</span>
was sufficient. It contrasts sharply with the hundreds of hours which the Labour Government, largely in the person of my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker), spent in attempts to produce a press charter.<br><br>
It is not right that working journalists should be treated in that cavalier fashion by the Secretary of State. I hope that he will take a more liberal view if and when he gets round to producing his code of practice. The only requirement placed upon him is to consult ACAS before issuing his draft. There is a provision for him to receive representation after publishing his draft. There is no requirement to conduct any further consultations with anyone.<br><br>
Although I am totally opposed to this provision, I should at least welcome an assurance that, when producing a draft code on the closed shop and the freedom of the press, the Secretary of State will voluntarily have proper and meaningful consultations with the National Union of Journalists before he issues his draft. That would give at least some sort of indication that he attaches proper importance to that body.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand why my hon. Friend is pursuing the matter on this clause. It was the Minister himself who said, among other things, that the clause would be used to introduce a code on freedom of the press I think that that was his phrase. I draw to my hon. Friend's attention that there may be an assumption by some that the Government will do what the Labour Government sought unsuccessfully and abortively to do—to produce a charter that would cover the whole range of matters that bear on press freedom and which were set out under headings, so to speak, in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Amendment) Act 1976.<br><br>
The charter was intended to deal not merely with union membership agreements but with a range of other matters, some of which my hon. Friend has alluded to, which are relevant to any discussion of press freedom. For example, the 1976 Act provides that
<br><blockquote><p>"practical guidance on matters relating to the freedom of the press must include guidance on the avoidance of improper pressure to distort or suppress news, comment, or criticism, the application of union membership agreements to journalists (and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 352</span>
in particular the right of editors to discharge their duties and to commission or publish any article) and the question of access for contributors."</p></blockquote>
As I see it—my hon. Friend may care to note this under clause 2 the code cannot touch matters other than, for example, union membership agreements. The purpose of this code will be merely—not "merely", that is the wrong word will be to promote the improvement of industrial relations.<br><br>
The Minister is not really talking about a code on press freedom. The code that he has in mind will bear on the conduct of the unions, perhaps the National Union of Journalists in particular, and will leave those other matters beyond its scope. They are not within the scope of the Bill or the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for making that point. He is absolutely right. It would have been much easier for us to consider these matters if the Government had given some inkling of the lines on which they are thinking regarding the contents of these codes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One sometimes wishes that those who are most critical of the Government would widen their reading and take in either the provisions of the Bill or at least the Second Reading speech of my right hon. Friend. On this very point, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I would not intend to use the power of repeal—</p></blockquote>
that relates to the charter—
<br><blockquote><p>"until those in the industry have had the opportunity of seeing our draft code. If there was still a strong desire for a charter, and a real possibility of reaching agreement on its terms, we would, of course, be prepared to reconsider any abolition of the charter itself."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 17 December 1979; Vol. 976, c. 63.1</p></blockquote>
My right hon. Friend is saying that if the code is thought by all concerned not to be sufficient and that further guidance is needed on a scale not appropriate to a code of practice on the closed shop, he would certainly reconsider his provisional intention to repeal the provision relating to a charter and go ahead if possible to produce a charter. That is exactly the point he was making.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Under-Secretary clarify this important point? If he tells me I am wrong I shall be pleased, but it has been my assumption that any code that may be produced to deal with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0691">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 353</span>
press freedom will first of all be circumscribed by the powers set out in the clause itself, that is to say, it will be a code that is concerned with the improvement of industrial relations.<br><br>
I quoted to the Committee, and I will do so again, the specific provisions of the 1976 Act which refer to the charter containing guidance on the avoidance of improper pressure to distort or suppress news.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: on a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter, I am not quite sure who is making the speech at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member is replying to the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister had given way to me—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We shall proceed much better if the Committee will respond to the Chair. The right hon. Member is responding to a question which was raised, and I am sure that, from his experience, he will be reasonably brief and the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) will be called to resume in proper time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was under the impression that the Minister had the Floor at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Doncaster has the Floor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The question of the avoidance of improper pressure to distort or suppress news was understood not merely to be the possible improper pressure that hypothetically a group of trade unionists may bring to bear. It was thought of in much wider terms as the improper pressure, for example, of advertisers. We had a case fairly recently. I think it was Trafalgar House which did not like what <i>The Times</i> was saying about the Cunard operations, as I understood it, and withheld about £18,000 of advertising from <i>The Times.</i>
The Committee could doubtless think of many other examples of distortion of news or improper pressure that have nothing to do with the activities of the National Union of Journalists or the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 354</span>
Institute of Journalists. It was for dealing with those other improper pressures as well that the press charter was conceived.<br><br>
If the hon. and learned Gentleman is telling me that the Secretary of State's code will deal also with that, there will be no one happier than I. As I understand it, that would be outside the scope of the powers conferred upon the Secretary of State by the clause. Am I right or wrong?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that at this point I must call the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) and ask the hon. and learned Gentleman to note what has been said. The Chair had assumed that the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) had risen to assist on a point which had been developed by the hon. Member.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Lead-bitter. Matters do become complicated when we have an intervention in an intervention and a point of order in the middle of it. But I think that we are back on course now.<br><br>
I am grateful, nevertheless, to my right hon. Friend for the point that he has made. There is not a complete parallel between the points which would be covered in a press charter, if there were one, and matters which can be covered in a code of practice which, as he points out, will have to be restricted to matters concerned with the promotion of the improvement of industrial relations. That is what the clause says.<br><br>
The part that is worrying me, as I am trying to make clear, is what the Secretary of State imagines to be the improvement of industrial relations. He may well have a totally false impression of the factors which militate against the freedom of the press. That is the whole point, because there is such a lot of mythology around that in some way a journalists' closed shop threatens the freedom of the press. That is far from being the case and in fact, the greater the extent of NUJ organisation, with its strong insistence on the item in the code of conduct which I have read to the Committee, the greater is the protection of the freedom of the press.<br><br>
May I also dispel what is a common misapprehension about the National Union of Journalists' policy on the closed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0692">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 355</span>
shop? I have heard complete misrepresentation of that in the Chamber before now. The NUJ policy is this. Where the members within an office or a group of newspapers, organised as a chapel, request it, the national executive will support them in a campaign for a closed shop. There is never, and has never been, any attempt by the national executive to impose a closed shop upon an office where it is not sought by the members working there. I emphasise also that when it has been introduced as policy within an office, it applies only to staff journalists and to freelance sports and news reporters. The idea has been put around so many times that it includes free-lance specialist contributors. It does not and never has done.<br><br>
A closed shop operated by the NUJ would never prevent the contribution of specialist articles by people who are not journalists because it well recognises that that is part of the normal process of producing a newspaper or magazine. That needs to be made clear. There has been a good deal of misrepresentation about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend agree with me on this point? Like him, I have been a member of the National Union of Journalists for a considerable number of years, and it was always my experience that, until the 1971 Act, the closed ship was never a burning issue. It was only the introduction of that piece of legislation which put the spotlight on it and caused many of the subsequent difficulties, If we have further legislation, in this field, including a code of practice, in the way that the Government envisage, we shall simply intensify the difficulties which, as at this moment, are not very great.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely true. That is what I was trying to say earlier in my speech. These closed shops existed all over the industry. I mentioned the classic case of Kemsley newspapers, where there was 100 per cent. membership for many years. It never caused any problems and no one at any time suggested that it was threatening the freedom of the press. Only since the 1971 Act has this become an issue, as my hon. Friend has said.<br><br>
I am worried that the Secretary of State will be carried away on the wave of antiunion feeling and get the idea that a closed shop by the NUJ inhibits press freedom.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 356</span>
It does nothing of the sort. I should like an assurance that, before he produces a draft code on this subject, he will have proper—friendly, I hope—consultations with the National Union of Journalists so that he fully understands the position. All I am asking is that he gets the facts before he produces his draft code.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish briefly to respond to the remarks of the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Madel) who, I thought, unerringly put his finger on the nub of the question. He gave an accurate and helpful explanation of the procedure and structure of ACAS and its council, explaining that there were three from the trade union side, three from the employers' side and three independents. They operate, therefore, by agreement and consent in a pragmatic, commonsense way. That is the way in which we should attempt to deal with industrial relations.<br><br>
Because the ACAS council members represent all sides, in the nature of things they cannot always agree, as he pointed out. It is precisely in these sensitive areas such as picketing and closed shops, where the parties cannot agree, that we are giving powers in this clause, to the Secretary of State to make law and to force through—the term "bludgeon through" has been used, but I do not know if that is an exaggeration—codes which would have to go through the House of Commons in 90 minutes. That is the nub of the question. Is that a good thing? Is it the way to have good industrial relations? All our history has shown that that is not the way to do it.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bedfordshire, South tried to allay our fears a little by talking about the 1975 Act. He got his metaphors slightly mixed. At one time he said there was a trigger and at another that there was a safety-catch, but at least he said that ACAS would give an opinion. He then asked, in the case when ACAS gave its opinion, whether the Secretary of State would go ahead if the ACAS opinion was critical. He was more or less suggesting that if ACAS was critical the Secretary of State, being a reasonable chap, would not go ahead.<br><br>
If that were in the Bill, we should be satisfied. That is basically what we have been asking for. But the Bill provides for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0693">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 357</span>
precisely the opposite. It gives all the powers to the Secretary of State, subject only to a 90 minute debate in the House of Commons.<br><br>
We have not seen the codes and we do not know what is likely to be in them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend has also said that he will see whether the Select Committee on Employment might play a part in discussing these codes, so it is not entirely as the hon. Gentleman has said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but Governments always look at things, do they not? They always keep things under review. It is not in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Were the Secretary of State not to consider that favourably, it still would not preclude the Select Committee from doing what we hope the Secretary of State will concede anyhow. The elect Committee has the power to send for papers and persons, and could demand to do precisely this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right. We shall look with interest to see how the Select Committee operates. All of us regard the Select Committee procedure as something novel and we shall—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That interjection from the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) was very interesting. Did my hon. Friend sense that it sounded more like a threat to the Secretary of State than to any remarks that he was making?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not like to impute motives to the hon. Member for Hendon, North where there was nothing malicious. He is an honourable gentleman, and I am quite certain that there was nothing like that in his mind.<br><br>
We shall need to watch how the Select Committee procedure works, and how effective it is. At the end of the day, what the Bill does is give these wide powers to the Secretary of State, regardless of what ACAS says.<br><br>
One would gather from some hon. Members on the Government Benches and from what we read in the newspapers and so on that there is virtually no law on picketing at the moment and that it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 358</span>
is highly necessary to rush through new laws. I can cite one example of which I had personal experience, a case called, speaking from memory, Piddington v. Bates, in 1960. Mr. Piddington was a personal friend of mine, one of the most gentle and inoffensive people I have ever met. This was in Islington, where there was a dispute in the printing industry.<br><br>
The inoffensive Mr. Piddington went along to picket, and the policeman on duty had said "Two pickets only". A car came along with more pickets, including Mr. Piddington, and the policeman said something like "No—on your way". Reading the transcript of the case one finds that Mr. Piddington said something to the effect of "I know my rights", and it was put that he had gently pushed past the policeman. Then, it said, he was gently arrested, and was found guilty of an offence.<br><br>
The idea that there is no law and that one may picket at will is incorrect. The hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South-West (Mr. Page) talked about a policeman regrettably being injured. Surely, he is not suggesting that that is not breaking the law? Those laws exist now, in the same way as when a policeman molests a picket, as also has happened, regrettably, on occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But he does not get charged.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All this is against the law now. I should not like people to think that there was no law or that there was some great need to rectify a gaping hole in the law. My anxiety about this is that we are giving virtually a blank cheque, subject only to a 90-minute debate in the House with a large Conservative majority which seems at present to be carried away on yet another wave of anti-union hysteria.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee for having missed the earlier part of the debate, and I intervene briefly to ask a question of the hon. and learned Gentleman and make a couple of brief points. My question relates to clause 2(5), which says that a code of practice
<br><blockquote><p>"may contain such transitional provisions or savings".</p></blockquote>
I find the word "savings" strange. I do not know what it is supposed to mean in this context and I am trying hard to figure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0694">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 359</span>
out what it could conceivably mean. The only sense I can put on it is by taking that in which the word was used in medieval English, to mean something like "exceptions", or "derogations", as the modern phrase has it in international trade agreements and the like. It is a strange work, and the hon. and learned Member—who, I suspect, has not noticed it before—if he knows the answer to my question might tell us the sort of things that could be in a code of practice under this heading.<br><br>
In medieval English, "saving" was used in exactly the same way that the word "save" was used, and occasionally still is by users of archaic English, to mean "except". If the idea is "exceptions" or "derogations" it makes sense, but I should have thought in that case It would have been better to say it. It is not a big point, but I am interested in it not so much as a legislator but as a student and lover of the language pure and undefiled.<br><br>
I make a point arising out of what my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) was just saying about what might be said about picketing within the framework of the code of practice. A code of practice, while delineating the rights, duties, hours and restraints or savings on pickets, ought to go wider. There was a point in my intervention during my hon. Friend's speech. If pickets are required to behave in a certain way, so should officers of the law be required to behave in a certain way. Perhaps a code of practice might lay down that it is possible for an officer to arrest a woman picket and put her into a bus to be taken away, without dragging her to that bus backwards by her long hair, as I have myself seen done. It might perhaps cover the case, which I have also seen, where a woman was being dragged by a policeman towards a bus, when another woman intervened, and said: "Hi, don't handle her as roughly as that", and the policeman dropped the woman he was dragging and instead seized his interlocutor the woman who had gone to protest and said: "You will do instead, Miss". It would be interesting to know with what offence she was charged. So I hope that if we have a code of practice about picketing it will be wider and more embracing than some people have in mind.<br><br>
The other point I wish to make is about closed shops. I am not familiar with the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 360</span>
printing and press industry and therefore cannot add to what my Friends the Members for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) and for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) said about it from their considerable knowledge and experience. I think that we ought not to overlook the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker), that interference with freedom of the press can come from many sources.<br><br>
If we are to have a code of practice about interference with freedom of the press, it ought not to embrace only one possible source of such interference. My right hon. Friend spoke of the pressures exercised by advertisers. That is an interference with the freedom of the press. There are two newspaper tycoons in this country who have said bluntly that, of course, they do not give their editors any freedom to run their newspapers in the way they want to.<br><br>
It is always assumed as part of the head and front of the concept of freedom of the press that the editor decides what goes in and takes responsibility, except in the case of a freelance contribution when he specifically disclaims responsibility. We know that there are at least two press groups where that does not apply, because the chaps who own them or represent the largest shareholders have said quite frankly and I pay tribute to them for their frankness—that there is no way they would let their editors be free to decide what goes into the newspaper and how it should be presented.<br><br>
There are other inhibitions on the freedom of the press. The D notice is a major one. The D notice is operated by the Government, and I have the impression that it, and the unofficial equivalent of the D notice—the nod and the wink, the lunch table directive—have been increasingly used by successive Governments of both parties over the past few years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member is making this interesting point about the various additional influences that ought to be considered in the code of practice, will he agree, reverting to his earlier point about picketing, that it would be a good idea if the code of practice also stated that neither Cabinet Ministers nor Members of Parliament joined picket lines?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0695">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 361</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>. No. I think that would be a silly idea. Some Members of Parliament are members of trade unions. Some of them hold senior positions in trade unions. Some of them are members of bodies which have authorised industrial action, and therefore they are responsible for taking industrial action. I do not see where the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) gets the idea from. He gets all sorts of strange ideas. He is not really in this world. He lives in some stratospheric missile hurtling round the globe, seven miles up, at 5,000 miles an hour. He asked if the idea was a good one. It is the silliest idea that I have heard, even from him, for a long time. I do not wish to be offensive.<br><br>
It is a silly idea, for example, for a member of the executive of a trade union which authorised a dispute not to be able to take the responsibility of showing his face. It is a silly idea that a Member of Parliament is some sort of different being, and that when a chap is elected to this place he ceases to have the connections which he had before. There are many connections which he has had before. The hon. Gentleman has many, I have, and a great many of us have. The idea that Members of Parliament are put in purdah and that they must not appear at any point of industrial dispute, far from being a good one is arrant nonsense.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would it not be advisable to encourage the present Cabinet Ministers to spend their time on picket lines? They would be engaged much less harmfully to the national interest than they are in the Cabinet. I am certain that when the Secretary of State for Industry recently visited a picket line he learnt a lot more about real life than he has learnt in the areas that he normally inhabits.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Chair has given a reasonable degree of flexibility, but this matter is not in the clause. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman could try to find a way to put it there, but so far it is not. I must ask the hon. Member to come back to the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your guidance, as always, Mr. Leadbitter. But we are talking about codes of practice, and it has been envisaged that there will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 362</span>
be a code of practice on picketing. Therefore, I suggest with all respect, that this matter is germane to a discussion on clause stand part. But I shall leave the subject. I merely make this comment in response to my hon. Friend the Member Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton). I do not say that Ministers should go to every picket line or spend much time there; but it would not do them any harm to go now and again to look. If, in the days of the back end of the Conservative Government in 1974, a Minister had gone to look at the picketing of the Saltley coke works I doubt that the right hon. Gentleman who was then Prime Minister would have dropped the awful clanger which led to the defeat of his party.<br><br>
I am not familiar with the printing industry, but I know a little about closed shops in another industry. When the National Joint Council for Civil Air Transport was set up after the passage of the Civil Aviation Act 1946, I was one of the initial members. I remained a member for 25 years. In fact, I was the only member on the trade union side throughout that period who was not a professional trade union officer. That council consisted of representatives of trade unions and of employers. The major employers were, naturally, the British Airways corporations. We started with three—Overseas, European and South American. South American disappeared after a while and we had two. Finally they were merged into British Airways.<br><br>
There are many closed shops in British Airways and nobody is more pleased about it and nobody welcomes them more cordially than the management of British Airways. Indeed, from the time we had an arrangement whereby when it was established that the circumstances in a given shop were appropriate for it to become a closed shop, that fact was minuted and recorded and that shop, department, workplace or whatever it was—mostly, but not entirely, we are talking about maintenance engineering bases—was registered as a closed shop.<br><br>
There is no doubt at all that there was a substantial improvement in industrial relations in the airways corporations, and certainly there was a substantial improvement in productivity in the engineering bases from the time that those closed shops began to be registered.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0696">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 363</span>
Therefore, when the hon. Gentleman and his right hon. Friend come to engage in some consultations, if they are issuing a code of practice in this field, when they are trawling for people to whom to talk and whose opinions to seek, they might include those who have operated closed shops at the joint desire of management and trade unions and have operated them with great success.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman underestimates the inherent dangers of writing into the Bill the fact that the codes of practice should be admissable in the courts. I accept his argument that the courts cannot be prevented from taking into account codes or practice. I accept his argument about the civil courts, and certainly as regards the Court of Appeal, where Lord Denning, has drawn widely on a whole variety of sources to buttress up his arguments and to make the law what he would like it to be. However, I do not accept that that is the case in the criminal courts. I do not think that the criminal courts draw very widely when coming to their decisions. The criminal law should be as precise as possible. The difficulties that obtain in criminal courts usually obtain from interpreting vague concepts like the judges' rules.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman has talked about codes of practice relating to picketing. By writing this provision into the Bill, he is inviting the courts—and the magistrates' courts, which are not necessarily well equipped to deal with vague concepts—to attach great weight to certain aspects of that code. I can see appeal after appeal and judicial interpretation after judicial interpretation upon whether or not undue weight has been given to a certain aspect, a certain section, a certain clause in the code.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. and learned Gentleman apply the same strictures to the use which is made of the Highway Code in the magistrates' courts, for example, on charges of careless of dangerous driving? Surely, it goes in the face of what he has just been urging that the criminal law does have regard—I suppose 10,000 times a day—to a code of practice.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 364</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It does not have regard to a code of practice in as sensitive an area as industrial relations. It has never had occasion to do so, and now the hon. and learned Gentleman in inviting the courts to do just that. It is all very well for the civil courts to have regard to wide interpretation of codes of practice. Someone's liberty is not at stake. In the case of an incident in a picket line, where the hearing in the magistrates' court is taking place against a background of highly charged emotion, the court's interpreting a code of practice in a way which turns out to be detrimental to the person charged adds to that emotionally charged atmosphere. The man will not feel that he has been treated fairly by the court.<br><br>
A result which the person charged believes has been brought about by the court placing undue weight on a particular aspect of a code, which is not written into the law but which is a code of conduct, can heighten the temperature and do the very thing which the Government, if they have any regard for industrial relations, would not want to do, that is, prolong the unpleasantness. That is the danger.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman, who has great experience in the courts—if I say that, people will think that I am flattering him unnecessarily, but he has—must understand that the feeling that undue weight has been put on things in that kind of atmosphere is doubly dangerous. First, it goes to the Court of Criminal Appeal, which may take the view that undue weight has been put upon a particular section of the code. Uncertainty is added to uncertainty. The pickets do not know where they stand, there is more emotional talk, the matter may even go to the House of Lords.<br><br>
The constant interpretation by courts of wage concepts will, in my view, lead to a person being put in a very difficult position. Whether he has brought it about himself is irrelevant. If one is charged with a criminal offence it is a very serious matter. One does not feel happy about having one's liberty, or a stain on one's record being decided by some vague concept which one does not fully understand. The hon. and learned Gentleman ought to think very carefully about the minefield that he is laying down. I have no great objection to a code of practice, but codes can become very detailed, and the worse is the result.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0697">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 365</span>
It has been suggested that some guidelines ought to be written into the code on how the police should behave, but I do not think that that is a wise course. If the Secretary of State decided that that should be written into the code, the courts would have to have regard to it. The hon. Gentleman knows how endless arguments go on in court, how trials are prolonged almost unnecessarily because of legal arguments over whether the judges' rules have been properly carried out.<br><br>
The greater the detail, in the code of conduct, the more difficult it will be for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 366</span>
magistrates, who are not as used to applying liberal interpretations of codes, to come to a proper decision. I urge the hon. and learned Gentleman to think very carefully about whether, by writing this into the Bill and inviting the courts to have regard to these codes in an area of great complexity where emotions reign, he will help either justice or good industrial relations.</span></p>
