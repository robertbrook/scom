	<p>—[	<i>Mr. Parkinson.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Trade (Mr. Cecil Parkinson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be helpful to the Committee if I set out the general position on the insider dealing clauses as a whole, since certain general themes and issues run
	<span class='label label-info column'>554</span>
through all these new clauses from 42 to 46.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I express the hope that in this instance it will be third time lucky, and that we shall finally succeed in having on the statute book an acceptable set of clauses dealing with the problem of insider dealing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1973 the Stock Exchange and the Take-Over Panel issued a joint statement calling for criminal sanctions against insiders. In the 1973 Companies Bill the then Conservative Government proposed criminal sanctions and some civil remedies. In that Bill much of the structure of subsequent proposals was established, and many of the definitions, although subsequently refined and, we believe, improved, were first set out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main criticism of that Bill was that there was no requirement for the prosecution to prove 	<i>mens rea,</i> or guilty mind, and that criticism was regularly repeated. The Bill, of course, fell with the general election of February 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1978 the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis), who played a large and important role in our discussions of company law in the years 1974–79 and who earned himself a considerable reputation for doing so, came forward with his own Bill. In that Bill a clear distinction was drawn between Stock Exchange deals and others. There were criminal sanctions for Stock Exchange deals and civil sanctions for the latter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found it puzzling at the time, and have not yet found anyone who could explain to me, why there were those two different approaches. I think that the explanation is that there was much more likely to be a face-to-face transaction off the Stock Exchange so that it might be possible, for instance, for the person who had sold the shares at below price to follow the insider and to tackle him for his profit. I think that was the reason. When I read these notes recently, it reminded me of my puzzlement at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was some refinement of the definitions in the clauses, both before introduction of the Bill at that time, and in Committee, and we introduced the concept of 	<i>mens rea.</i> But there was widespread concern about the width of the prohibition and definitions. There was much debate on the subject during that Committee stage, and widespread
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0305">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>555</span>
dissatisfaction was expressed that the clauses were too widely drawn and that the definitions were not sufficiently accurate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier this year, after lengthy consultation and consideration, the Stock Exchange adopted a model code for directors' share dealings, with certain defined periods when dealings were not to take place, and other times when dealings could take place, but there was a procedure for prior notification and acknowledgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, we have our own set of proposals, published last month, but already widely discussed. A number of substantial representations have been received about our proposals, and we believe that after a six-year period of more or less continuous debate on the subject, during which proposals have been put forward, refined and—in our opinion—improved, we now have a set of proposals in which, although they are obviously capable of improvement, we believe we have dealt with most of the flaws in previous proposals. The proposals contained in new clause 42 and the succeeding clauses should do the job that successive Governments—and not only Governments but influential bodies in the City and people involved in these issues—have felt should be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the central issue, the imposition of criminal sanctions. The Government's view, which I stated quite clearly on Second Reading, is that self-regulation is not enough. That view is widely held in the City, in industry and commerce and, I believe, in the House. It is notable that many of the critics of our proposals say that they believe that insider dealing should be a criminal offence and that there should be criminal sanctions. They may object to some aspect of our proposals, but they believe that criminal sanctions are needed if we are to outlaw insider dealing and make it a much less attractive proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In saying that, I in no way denigrate self-regulation. It has played an important role in filling the gap caused by successive failures by Governments to get proposals such as these on to the statute book and in promoting a basic change in attitude towards insider dealing. But to make the Government's position clear, I make the clear and unequivocal statement that we believe that insider dealing
	<span class='label label-info column'>556</span>
is wrong and should be subject to criminal sanctions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Committee stage on the previous Bill my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton), whom we sadly miss in our deliberations on this Bill, said that in his view insider dealing was an unpardonable sin, as you may remember, Sir Stephen. You, showing a great knowledge of theology, as on any matter that that Committee discussed, pointed out to him that his proposition was theologically unsound. It is theologically impossible to have such a thing as an unpardonable sin. All sin is pardonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A sin against the Holy Ghost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now we have someone who is perhaps even better informed on theology, so I shall leave that subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did get himself into a mess about harems last time. This is far more dangerous territory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. I am not well qualified on the subject of harems, or about theology, so I shall quickly return to the subject of insider dealing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give the Committee examples, one of which I gave during our Committee proceedings on the previous Bill, to demonstrate why I personally feel so strongly about this crime. I say "crime" because I believe it to be a crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some years ago, when I was in practice as an accountant, my firm acted as registrars of a company. A bid was mounted for the company, which was in great difficulties and likely to collapse. After discussions, a person decided to mount a bid for the company. Between the taking of the decision and the date of the formal announcement, a parcel of over 100,000 shares was acquired continuously in the market. The market in those shares was very narrow. This activity in the market pushed the price of the shares to very near the bid price, and almost torpedoed the bid. Had the bid not gone ahead the company would, I believe, have collapsed. Employment would have been lost. Indeed, a business would have been lost, which was subsequently turned round and built into a very successful business by the person who took it over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0306">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>557</span>
Several years later, we discovered, through a coincidence with which I shall not bore the Committe, that the person who had been dealing in the market was one of the directors of the company and that he had made a very substantial profit by his activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seemed to me that that person would not have been deterred by the prospect of civil action against him, but that he would have thought twice if one of the possibilities had been that he would have had to appear in the dock at the Old Bailey, charged with a criminal offence. The very fact that that might have been a possible result of his activities would, in my opinion, have been a substantial deterrent. And if that prospect had not prevented him from doing what he did—as in my view it would have done—it would quite properly have opened him up to severe punishment for what I believe was a crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was my first contact with a real insider. Ever since those days, I have had very strong views, especially since I subsequently came across another case which, similarly, almost had disastrous results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am convinced, and I know that the hon. Member for Hackney, Central is convinced, that we must press ahead with this legislation. But I realise that the introduction of criminal law into a new area causes feelings of apprehension, and it is essential that the definitions should be as precise as possible, so that people should know clearly what their obligations are and at what stage they are committing a crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government believe that our proposals achieve the desired result, but we are open to suggestions about improving them. We look forward to what members of the Committee have to say, but we believe that the proposals at present before the Committee constitute a viable set of measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to those proposals in detail. First, I shall set out the main changes from the earlier legislation. We believe that new clause 42 includes a better definition of unpublished price-sensitive information. Our definition includes a restriction relating to information about specific matters. It excludes general overall impressions. It is more specific than the earlier definitions. We
	<span class='label label-info column'>558</span>
believe that by the new wording we have removed some of the difficulties, debated strongly in the Committee on the last Bill, about what information is generally available and about the problems of information that might be available on request. On whose request? That was the question. We believe that we have removed those difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think that the introduction of a restriction on information obtained by an insider in his capacity as such, and on information which it is reasonable for such a person not to disclose, except for the proper performance of his functions, will be welcomed by the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that that encapsulates the element of confidentiality within a company in a way that avoids problems and uncertainties, some of which were pointed out to us on the previous Bill in a rather negative way. We think that the proposals before the Committee help towards achieving a better definition of activities that the previous Committee considered to be a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have moved away from the requirement in face-to-face transactions to disclose a connection with a company. It would not have been satisfactory and would have meant very little to many people. It would not have applied to tippees, it could have been avoided by the use of nominee companies, and could have trapped the innocent very easily. We have proposed instead an extension of the approach that we take to Stock Exchange deals and to other deals in similar off-Stock Exchange markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have dropped the special power to appoint inspectors to investigate suspected cases of insider dealing. We do not think that it is right to provide such far-reaching powers that can threaten individual rights. If such powers are not generally needed for the investigation of crime, they should not be needed in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the key features of our proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister is mistaken here. The Department of Health and Social Security is stepping up its number of investigators by several hundred—400 or 600, I have forgotten the exact number—in order to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0307">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>559</span>
discover frauds on social security, which amount, it is generally surmised, to about £3 million a year. If the Department of Health and Social Security thinks it appropriate to appoint inspectors for that purpose, why do the Government think it inconsistent to appoint them for this purpose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We considered that point very carefully, and the hon. Member has risen right on cue. When we thought about it earlier, we predicted that it was a point in which he would take special interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very clever of the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is one of two things. Either it proves that I am very clever, or that the hon. Member is rather predictable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We took the view that, in practice, we could obtain the information that is needed, using existing officials and using the Stock Exchange mechanisms. Our proposal to get rid of investigators could make it easier to obtain the information that we want. There are question-marks over the whole subject of inspectors in this area. After careful thought, we came to the conclusion that we should prefer to do things in the way set out in our proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the more innocuous Bill as originally drafted, it was estimated that a net increase of about nine staff would be needed to administer the provisions as they were then. Presumably, if there are to be no outside inspectors, increased tasks could fall on the Department. Does the Minister expect any greater need for manpower in his Department as a result of the new clauses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is "No". I turn now to two particular issues which have been raised on our present proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a case of suspected insider dealing is raised—through information which comes to the Department in the way that other information relating to aberrant activities of directors arises—would the Minister be inclined to use the powers available
	<span class='label label-info column'>560</span>
to him under section 109 of the 1967 Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to consider that. The truth of the matter is that I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a specific answer at this moment. When I come to wind up the debate, I shall give the hon. Gentleman an answer to his question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was about to deal, first, with a problem about which we have had considerable correspondence. It is the problem of whether directors and employees may continue to hold shares in the companies they work for, following these proposals. Obviously, this is a matter to which we have given a great deal of thought. There have been strong fears about the inhibiting effects of our proposals expressed by such reputable sources as the Institute of Directors and a number of leading industrialists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, there has been a substantial amount of support for our proposals from such bodies as the CSI, the Law Society and the CBI, which had previously expressed concern about the effect that the earlier proposal would have had on employee and director shareholders. These organisations are now satisfied on that count as a result of the modification of our proposals in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have carefully considered the representations that we have had. As the Committee knows, the Government are strongly in favour of spreading the ownership of shares. We wish to see more people as shareholders, not fewer. Therefore, we would not wish to promote proposals which would prevent the spread of share ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that our proposals do not threaten the spread of share ownership or the employee or director shareholder. The essential safeguard is that no one is prohibited from dealing unless he knows that he possesses unpublished price-sensitive information. This is the heart of the matter. We are not talking about information which companies wish to keep to themselves for a variety of reasons. They may not wish to assist their competitors or prejudice their relation with their suppliers, their subcontractors or their customers. They may simply have a natural desire to retain commercial confidentiality. There is no doubt that directors, at any given
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0308">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>561</span>
moment, always know something about their company which other people do not know. But the question is whether it is unpublished price-sensitive information and whether the director knows that it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Directors have information which could cause their shares to take a sudden leap or a sudden plunge. They know things which, if announced, would not move the shares one iota. One of the things that I always found rather disappointing, before I came into the House, concerned one of the companies about which I was talking earlier. We announced record profits for six consecutive years and no one seemed to be remotely interested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Very often the reaction to a company's announcement of increased profits is not a sudden dramatic surge in the market. People going into the building industry, for example, are concerned not only about the performance of individual companies but about the economic prospects of the whole sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore not all the information which directors have—undoubtedly they have more than other people—is of the kind that would move the market were it to become known. I do not believe that every day, in every company, a board is considering these matters, or that directors know that they are about to make a bid or that the company is about to collapse or that something dramatic is about to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although, some years ago, the series on television—"The Power Game"—gave the impression that big business is a permanent, 100 per cent. full-time drama, I do not believe it. I do not believe that the directors of businesses, on a daily basis, are in possession of information which, if known, would move the price mountain. Therefore, although there will be occasions when directors know things which are not published, which are price-sensitive and which, if revealed, might have an impact on the shares—or, when revealed, will do so—such directors will know the distinction between their day-to-day knowledge about their business and their knowledge of important factors which, when revealed to the market, will shift the price. It is in that set of circumstances that we wish to protect the shareholder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>562</span>
It is vital that millions of small shareholders—we hope there will be millions of them—have confidence that they will not be ripped off in the market place. I do not believe that they need have that fear. I do not believe that the information which most directors have on a daily basis is of a kind that need inhibit them in holding and dealing in their shares. It is because we believe this that we have put forward our proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not possible for directors themselves not only to have price-sensitive information but to create it by either increasing the notional value of certain capital assets—buildings and so on—in relation to the market, or by decreasing it and taking that decision themselves?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it may be possible. But if, on the basis of that, they then deal they will be committing a criminal offence under these proposals. Directors would have to think very carefully about that. If they started to manipulate the shares and knew that they were doing so deliberately I should have thought that when they were doing that they were in possession of price-sensitive information. If they were, they would now know that they would be committing a criminal offence and that they could find themselves being prosecuted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that it is fundamental to our proposals that the director has to know that the information
	<br><blockquote><p>"is unpublished price sensitive information".</p></blockquote>
Elsewhere in the clause we use the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"knows or has reasonable cause to believe",</p></blockquote>
which is a significantly lower standard. But we do not say that in this key provision. It has to be shown that the director knew that the information was likely materially to affect the price. That is what has to be focussed on and all the surrounding circumstances may be relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Did the company have a prior notification of dealings? Was it followed? Were the views of the other directors sought? I do not believe that compliance with such arrangements should be written into the Bill as an automatic defence, for that would mean that by going through certain formal steps even blatant insider dealing could be taken outside the scope of the law. As the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0309">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>563</span>
clauses are drafted, evidence as to such matters will be relevant and will have an important role to play, without any specific reference to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can appreciate that the uncertainty necessarily associated with the introduction of new criminal provisions provokes real apprehensions, which have been well set out in the range of letters that we have received. In fairness, however, we should consider the provisions of the legislation. We believe that there are real, valuable and fundamental protections for directors and employees. I am pleased to say that that is agreed by a number of people who were unhappy about the original proposals put forward by the previous Conservative and Labour Governments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those people now feel that we have met a number of their fears, although there are still some who have expressed strong reservations. Nevertheless, as I said earlier, it is interesting that the person expressing the strongest reservations went on to say that he believed that insider dealing should indeed be a criminal offence and that if we could put forward different proposals he would he happier. The principle was accepted, but he had objections to the details of the proposals. It is encouraging, however, that the number of people with such objections is steadily diminishing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn finally to financial institutions. The Committee knows that the Government have welcomed moves by financial institutions to play a more active role as shareholders in companies in which they have stakes. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Industry made this clear in a recent speech to the National Association of Pension Funds. We believe that such institutions should be concerned not just to step in when things go badly wrong in the companies in which they invest but also, as major shareholders, to keep up an active pressure on companies to maintain and improve their efficiency and general performance. In the course of such activities, price-sensitive information may be obtained, but I am sure that it is recognised both by the company and by the institutions that price-sensitive information obtained partly as a result of those activities should not be used as the basis for dealing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>564</span>
We believe that these clauses impose no real inhibitions on financial institutions in contacting the businesses in which they have an interest and in monitoring the performance of those companies. However, institutions which have acquired price-sensitive information in those circumstances clearly should not take advantage of that. I am sure that most reputable institutions would not dream of doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise to the Committee for the length of my remarks, but this is an important set of proposals. I believe that after two false starts we now have proposals which deserve the Committee's support. I hope that they will command that support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister rather skated over the question of disgorgement, which always troubled me a great deal when I was a Minister. I am bound to say, however, that I was in a minority and was unable to persuade my Secretary of State. It was not a resigning issue and hardly a matter of conscience, but that was the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would not the Minister consider that power should be vested in the court to order, following conviction, that a person guilty of insider dealing should, where appropriate—I stress those words—make payment by way of compensation to the company or to any other person or persons who may been prejudiced or injured by reason of that use of insider information?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These days the criminal courts generally have the power to make orders of compensation in certain specific circumstances. I do not believe—though I stand to be corrected—that those powers apply here. Nevertheless, the principle has been utilised in other respects. Should such a power not be utilised here, beyond the power simply to fine or to imprison?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an interesting issue. One of the reasons why the hon. Member for Hackney, Central was not able to carry his colleagues or officials with him, was probably the problem—especially in Stock Exchange dealings—of linking the person who makes the profit with the person who makes the loss. As he knows, it is not easy to show that a particular shareholder made the loss represented by the gain made by a particular insider. Indeed, it is almost impossible. There is often a chain of deals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are possible alternatives. In
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0310">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>565</span>
connection with an earlier part of the Bill we discussed, for example, loans, transactions, and agreements. We said that if someone makes a profit, it should go to the company. If a loss is established, the company should be reimbursed. But the hon. Gentleman knows that it is not the company that makes the loss on these occasions, but a body of individual shareholders, perhaps over a period of months. It is not easy to trace and link directly those who made the loss and those who made the profit. I suspect that that was the major stumbling block that the hon. Gentleman found when he wished to follow his line of reasoning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was never very convinced, but we were anxious—as the Minister is now—to get on with the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stressed the words "where appropriate"—that is to say, if the trial judge, in the relevant circumstances, thinks fit, and if the situation is blatant. At least the Minister should not close his mind to this possibility. We can return to the matter on Report, with a specific amendment if necessary. Does the Minister agree that the proposition is worth further consideration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter to which we have already given a great deal of consideration. But, of course, one does not approach the Committee stage of a Bill with a closed mind, or the whole exercise is pointless. I make no promises to the hon. Gentleman. But I am looking forward to hearing his arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is so genial, so persuasive, and so open-minded that had he not reminded us on several occasions that he was an accountant in an earlier incarnation, I should have thought that he had been a salesman. I was swept along—as I am sure were my colleagues—by the Minister when he said that some say that the Government have gone too far, some say that perhaps they have not gene far enough, but that he believed that we have got it about right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition, however, are not at all convinced that the Government have it about right on this occasion. I hope briefly to set out some of our causes for concern and areas of anxiety about the Government proposals. Given the relatively short time that we had have for
	<span class='label label-info column'>566</span>
consideration, the Government could hardly expect us at this stage to make fully considered proposals. I shall indicate the areas that we believe that the Government should consider before we reach Report stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thing is clear. We can be thankful that we have at least made a start this time after, as the Minister said, a number of false starts. Given that this Bill has been introduced at the beginning of a Session, it has a chance of success that was denied to its predecessors in 1973 and 1978.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, there has been a long period of gestation. But we fear that, even after the record pregnancy, what will emerge will be so handicapped as to be probably not viable and not worth the effort which the Minister and his advisers have put into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At least the Government have recognised the problem and the degree of public concern arising from the revelations of the series of company inspections of past years. They have also recognised that self-regulation is manifestly insufficient, as has been revealed by the inspectors' reports, and that there is a need at the end of the day for criminal sanctions to buttress self-regulation, which will continue to exist despite the safety net of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that this is a formidably difficult area for legislation because much will stem from complex human relationships—the nod, the wink, the tip in the golf club, the indication from an individual who will say over the telephone, "We have known each other for a long time. I advise you to invest in so-and-so or to disgorge your shares in some other company. I cannot tell you why—you know the reasons."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not specific information. It would be acted upon but would probably not be caught by the Government's provisions. We recognise that much will depend upon a web of human relationships in which it would be difficult for any watertight legislation to be enacted. The clue could be given to an individual that it would be worth his while to take a course of action, but insufficiently specific in its detail for it to come within the ambit of these clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is the nature of the price-sensitive information. Think, for example, of a company, built up by a particularly charismatic individual, in which the public has trust because it trusts that individual.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0311">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>567</span>
A medical report on that individual, showing that he has a terminal illness, would radically affect the worth of the shares. Yet, on my reading of the proposals, although that medical information, which will be known to the chairman's medical adviser and may have been divulged to one or two directors, would be very price-sensitive, it would not come within the ambit of the Bill. If I am wrong, perhaps the Minister will tell me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also rather sceptical about the practical effect of the criminal sanctions proposals. We are confirmed in our scepticism by the general chorus of approval of the Minister's proposals from City institutions. There is hardly a note of dissent from the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies or the Council for the Security of Industry. The issue of 	<i>Accountancy Age</i> dated 26 October again gave a broad welcome to the Bills. So we would have the same scepticism, given that chorus of approval, that we would have for, say, Government proposals on tightening up the rules on cigarette advertising if there was a similar chorus of approval from cigarette manufacturers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will, therefore, realise that, after all, they may not have got it quite right, since the institutions which could be on the receiving end of this legislation, and individuals within them, are broadly satisfied with the Government's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fear, looking through the provisions of new clauses 42, 43 and 44, is that there are so many hurdles and different criteria to satisfy simultaneously that it will be extremely difficult to obtain a conviction. Offenders need to be guilty at the same time in so many different ways. To be caught, they have to be
	<br><blockquote><p>"knowingly connected with a company".</p></blockquote>
and it must be
	<br><blockquote><p>"reasonable to expect a person so connected".</p></blockquote>
An offender has to know that information
	<br><blockquote><p>is unpublished price sensitive information",</p></blockquote>
and so on. It is a form of obstacle race for the prosecution and provides a field day for any reasonably qualified defence lawyer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect, therefore, that with all those obstacles, and for a number of other reasons, the practical effect in terms of convictions—later we shall be discussing
	<span class='label label-info column'>568</span>
the deterrent effect—will be small. The Government have created a net with so many large holes that no one will be caught in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, how will the prosecution be able to obtain sufficient evidence? My hon. Friend pointed out some of the problems. The Government have discarded the earlier proposal for investigating inspectors to be appointed by the Secretary of State. In answer to my intervention, the Minister has apparently also ruled out the possibility of a cadre of civil servants within the Department specifically charged with the supervision of these new clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will not be any civil servants left after today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One does not know whether these will come within the 75,000 who face the axe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A body of experts needs to be built up. The Minister is surely hobbling the possibility of successful prosecutions if he is not allowing civil servants to specialise in this area. My hon. Friend also made the point about additional duties under section 109.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many respects the Bill is too narrow in its scope. In new clause 42(2)(	<i>d</i>) the prohibition
	<br><blockquote><p>"relates to any transaction (actual or contemplated) involving both the first company"</p></blockquote>
and another company. Subsidiaries of that other company are just as relevant, since information relating to the first company, or subsidiaries, could have a substantial effect on the value of those additional companies. We hope that the Minister will therefore consider widening the new clause to cover the subsidiary company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In opening, the Minister made much of the compromise that has been reached in the interpretation clause, new clause 46(2), which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any reference in this Part of this Act to unpublished price sensitive information in relation to any securities of any company is a reference to information which</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>a</i>) relates to specific matters relating or of concern (directly or indirectly) to that company, that is to say, is not of a general nature relating or of concern to that company".</p></blockquote>
One has only to imagine the difficulties of any judge in seeking to explain to a jury the difference between general and specific information in any particular area. There should be clearer guidance in that respect. In the case of a large company, for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0312">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>569</span>
example ICI, something can be specific which can be very general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me take information in another area which can be very price-sensitive—oil exploration. If it is known to a company that a particular oil field has proved to be of value, that information may affect a number of other companies which have interests in that oil field. Yet it can have the most dramatic effect on the value of the shares in a particular company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can information be "specific" or "general"—and not just in an academic sense? At some stage a judge will have to guide a jury on the meaning of "general" or "specific" The interpretation is so difficult that any seasoned defence lawyer as eloquent as the Minister will have a very enjoyable day using that and the many escape holes which the Government have conveniently provided. The Minister says that the Government have solved the problem by differentiating between "general" and "specific", but it poses as many questions as it answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are questions about what is necessary to constitute a tip—"directly or indirectly" says the new clause. How "indirect" should it be? That is not defined and perhaps cannot be defined. But one can imagine the difficulties in a case in a criminal court when a jury is making up its mind and properly being directed on that definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One other area is not covered and it is one on which at some stage it would be helpful to have a Government response. It is whether there should be restrictions on persons who acquire information by dishonest or improper means. I think particularly of people who acquire price-sensitive information about the fortunes of a company by means of bugging, for example. We know that it happens, and given the pace of technological development, it is likely to be an increasing problem. Should that be defined as a criminal offence in the Bill to restrain an individual who acquires information by improper means?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not happy about the use, in new clause 42, of the word "individuals". Subsection (1) contains the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to subsection (8) below, an individual who is, or at any time".</p></blockquote>
It is unusual, to say the least, to find the word "individual" in statute. In our view, further study is needed here. Why cannot a company commit that offence,
	<span class='label label-info column'>570</span>
since information clearly can be held corporately?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One turns to new clause 27, for example—the penalties clause which the Committee has already considered in relation to the prohibition of loans to directors. New clause 27(2) provides sanctions against a relevant company. Perhaps the Minister could say why he holds the view that a company as such cannot be brought within the ambit of these insider dealing proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One notes that there is no restriction in new clause 27, as there is in new clause 45, to the effect that proceedings for an offence should be instituted only with the leave of the Secretary of State or the Director of Public Prosecutions. It is difficult to see why there should be a difference between these two clauses. Why is leave needed in one case but not in the other? In my view the procedure should be uniform, whether leave should be required or not required in both cases. It is difficult to see the rationale for that distinguishing feature between those two clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the rewards of insider trading can be great. The penalties, however, may still be small. How do we deprive the criminal of his gain? In the past there have been suggestions that this problem can be dealt with adequately by the size of the fine. Some people have even suggested that, as in other statutes, the fine might be a multiple of the gain to the individual. But one still fears that, given the penalties available, the crime may still be worth while.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend mentioned the possibility of compensation under the powers available to the criminal courts. I am not convinced of the adequacy of that remedy, because our criminal courts have always avoided the question of compensation in areas where there is any complexity. They say that they are not staffed for or not geared to undertaking to consider compensation in those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One is therefore forced to reconsider possible civil remedies of disgorgement. Under new clause 45(3),
	<br><blockquote><p>"No transaction shall be void or voidable by reason only that it was entered into in contravention of section (Prohibition on stock exchange deals by insiders …)or (Prohibition on abuse of information obtained in official capacity) above."</p></blockquote>
That subsection expressly excludes certain civil remedies, whereas in the clauses relating to directors' transactions civil remedies are available. A court is therefore
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0313">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>571</span>
very likely to conclude that there is no civil remedy available in respect of insider dealing, where the rewards for an offender can be very great.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend to the Minister consideration of a formula similar to that in section 35(2) of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976, which provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the obligation to comply with that paragraph is a duty owed to any person who may be affected by a contravention of it and any breach of that duty is actionable accordingly subject to the defences and other incidents applying to actions for breach of statutory duty."</p></blockquote>
Effectively, if a formula along the lines of that section were incorporated into these provisions, it would provide a civil remedy for breach of statutory duty and thus meet the point about disgorgement that my hon. Friend has raised. I commend consideration of that formula to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is this. How will offences under the heading of insider dealing come to light? The Minister has said that there will be no corps of inspectors and no new civil servants—even leaving aside the problems posed by today's announcement. The only time that the crime of insider dealing will come to light is when it is in the interests of an individual to bring it to light. It is only likely to be in the interests of an individual if that individual—who will presumably be aggrieved—feels that he will benefit as a result of what he has brought to light. Although there can be a fine, the criminal penalties offer no incentive—assuming that he cannot gain in any civil action—to an individual who has lost as a result of insider dealing to give information to the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who will divulge an act of insider dealing? From what other source will the Department obtain its information? It may obtain certain information as a result of company inspections, but they are relatively few and very expensive. Surely, the whole purpose of the insider dealing proposals is to reveal the wrongdoing speedily, cheaply and expeditiously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Government accept in principle the proposition that insider dealing should be a crime, they are putting many obstacles in the way of a successful prosecution, not only in the wording of the clauses but also in not providing watchdogs and manpower to carry out the investigations. They are also giving no
	<span class='label label-info column'>572</span>
incentive to individuals to bring possible breaches to the attention of the Department. We fear, in spite of the Minister's brave and genial words, that after this long gestation period the clauses will, in effect, be stillborn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, having said that, we are thankful for the start, though we are most doubtful about the effectiveness of the proposals in practice. If it be true that after a period of years we shall see no, or virtually no, successful prosecutions under these clauses—although we know that the activity is carried on—their only practical effect will be in a sort of declaratory sense. They will indicate that the Government do not like insider dealing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government provided some form of ultimate criminal sanctions, yet the only effect of the new clauses would be to deter individuals who might otherwise be persuaded to indulge in insider dealing. That may be the only deterrent effect of what the Government now trumpet as a great new advance in dealing with insider trading. Clearly, though it is a small and possibly ineffective start, the Government—as the Minister has said, he is very open-minded—need to review the operation of these clauses when they become law and adjust them in the light of experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that there will be no prosecutions. I hope that these preliminary observations will become more substantial when we reach Report and have had time to consult, digest and compare with other similar legislation—not only in Singapore but in the United States. I hope that the Minister will understand that, having flown some kites and expressed some scepticism, we reserve our position substantially at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I stress a point made by my hon. Friend the Minister? I hope that we shall not, in an excess of zeal to punish breaches of confidence and breaches for personal gain, make the insider dealing legislation such a minefield of criminal offences that every director and employee will hesitate to become a shareholder in his own company. When one looks at this present rash of clauses one wonders whether any one, in any way connected with the company, would ever want to hold shares in their company, in case they should—if they deal in those shares—be accused of having unpublished
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0314">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>573</span>
price-sensitive information, and thereby be commiting a criminal offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must try to strike a balance. Everyone considers that it is desirable that directors and employees should have an identity of interest with the shareholders by owning shares themselves and being personally concerned in the equity value of the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any reasonable person's mind will work in this way if he has some savings to invest. He will think, "If I invest these savings, there may come a time when I shall be in some financial difficulty and need them—it might be a good idea to pay off the mortgage, perhaps I shall have to move to a bigger house. Shall I, therefore, put my savings on deposit account in the bank, or in the building society or even keep them under the mattress, so that I can get them immediately when I need them? Shall I invest them in the company with whom I am employed and whose business I know pretty well by now? I have been with that company for some time, I know its ups and downs and can forecast pretty well what will happen".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he puts that proposition to his wife, she—wise woman—will probably say, "Why not put it in the company? You have good knowledge there, you know more about what the dividend from your company will be next year, than you know about what the bank rate and interest rate is going to be next week". I think that that is true with most people. Then that man would say to his wife, "You have just hit the nail on the head. In technical language you have said—although you do not realise as you eat your porridge or crack your egg in the morning—that I have unpublished price-sensitive information. Therefore, I cannot deal in those shares. They are frozen in my hands if I buy them".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am exaggerating a little because that man could, perhaps, resort to subsection (8)(	<i>a</i>) of the new clause and if he were selling the shares, could escape if he could show that he was
	<br><blockquote><p>"doing any particular thing otherwise than with a view to the making of a profit or the avoidance of a loss (whether for himself or another person) by the use of that information".</p></blockquote>
The phrase is
	<br><blockquote><p>"otherwise than with a view to the making of a profit".</p></blockquote>
No doubt if he intends to sell the shares he
	<span class='label label-info column'>574</span>
will immediately look at the price at which the shares are quoted and think to himself, "With the use of the information that I have I can get a better price than that—and I can make a bit of profit on them or, at worst, a mere profit on what I purchased them for". So it would be very difficult for him to be covered by the exception under subsection (8)(	<i>a</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are faced with the problem that an employee or director holding shares has those shares frozen in his hands. It is not only that. He can say to his dear wife who has been advising him over the breakfast table, "If I step under a bus and leave my estate to you, my personal representatives will also have the shares frozen in their hands". That will be so unless they can bring themselves within the provisions of the rather tight subsections (10) and (11), and that will not be very easy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the position of trustees. It is a practical point. We ought to see that personal representatives and genuine trustees are protected. I am not quite sure how to define the trustees beyond saying "genuine" trustees. I am not talking about trusts set up specifically to make profits out of buying and selling shares but people such as personal respresentatives who have to deal with an estate and the genuine trustees who have to deal, perhaps, with a trust under a will. Those people will be in difficulties because they will have to struggle with subsection (10) and show that they were dealing in the shares
	<br><blockquote><p>"otherwise than with a view to the making of a profit".</p></blockquote>
Indeed, if they were doing so, and there were a profit to be made, they would be guilty of a breach of trust if they did not take it. That is the position of the trustees if they do not do the best they can for the beneficiary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to subsection (11) which I call the trustees' subsection. It says that personal representatives and trustees will be presumed to be acting in accordance with subsection (8)(	<i>a</i>) if they take proper advice. I think that it will be difficult for a personal representative, wishing to clear up an estate, to comply with those paragraphs, unless there is a specific provision exempting trustees from their ordinary rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have liked to see a special provision in the Bill for trustees expressly to relieve them, if they feel that they have to act as shareholders and insiders, of liability for breach of trust
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0315">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>575</span>
if they decline to act on any inside information. If they treat themselves as insiders and feel that they have inside information and then refuse to deal with the shares so as to make a profit for the beneficiary, they should be relieved of liability to their beneficiary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Duties are imposed on trustees and personal representatives under the clause which may conflict with their duty otherwise in law to their beneficiaries. If we intend to relieve them of one duty or the other, that should be expressly stated in the Bill, or there will be conflicting duties and they will have to choose between them.

The hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Clinton Davis) in an across-the floor discussion with the Minister raised the question of a person who benefits from wrongly dealing in shares when he has inside information being made to disgorge his wrongful profits, and, conversely, being made to compensate the innocent victim; the hon. Member asked how one links up the person who has suffered from those transactions with the person who has caused them by a breach of confidence in using information which he has about his own company. The phrase "linking up" was used by my hon. Friend, but how does one link up the criminal with the victim?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that the company might have the right to sue the person who has made the gain. That seems fair enough. If he is brought to justice as a criminal, there is no reason why he should not disgorge the profits which he has made, as well as pay for his crime. It is true that the company may benefit, but the company may not have been the victim, and that is the difficulty. But at least there would be some compensation for the other shareholders in that company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is raised whether one should extend that principle from the insider dealer to the person with whom he dealt—the person for whom we are now using this extraordinary phrase "the tippees"—and pursue him if he has profited out of it. Why not, if he is identifiable? He is as guilty in receiving and acting on that information as the man who gave it to him, provided he knows that it is insider information. I hope that my hon. Friend will consider this again at the next stage of the Bill and see if the civil side cannot be dealt with as much as the criminal side
	<span class='label label-info column'>576</span>
in a later clause. I am encroaching on later clauses, but so did previous speakers and you, Sir Stephen, were kind enough to allow them to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 42(4) is what I call the takeover provision. The drafting is extremely difficult to understand. I do not complain about the draftsman making it difficult, because I do not see how he could have made it easy. I will try to give an example of a takeover process and see how subsection (10) applies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suppose a company wishes to take over another company and instructs its merchant bankers—as is frequently done—or some other adviser to purchase shares in the market in order to build up a stake in the company from which the first company can launch its bid. Subsection (4) would, I believe, prohibit that activity. It would clamp down on an activity which is not uncommon at present and is not caught at the stages that I have described by any Stock Exchange code about takeovers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible that the first company, when instructing its merchant bankers or other advisers to buy shares in another company, has no intention of making a takeover bid but merely wants a holding, a good investment, in one of its brother or rival companies—by which I mean not a subsidiary or a connected company, but a company in the same market. But the merchant bankers who are instructed to buy the shares may then suspect that a bid to take over the second company is about to take place. Are they in contemplation of a takeover bid? The main point in subsection (4) seems to be that somebody
	<br><blockquote><p>"is contemplating, or has contemplated"</p></blockquote>
a takeover bid. This is where the drafting becomes difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to describe a perfectly ordinary type of case from two aspects. In one case, there may be an intention to build up a launching platform for a takeover bid. Another case may involve pure investment. The condition for proceedings under subsection (4) against an offender is that that person is contemplating, or had contemplated, making a takeover bid. If the drafting of subsection (4) could be made clearer, this would help to identify offenders in takeover bids and to relieve those quite properly acquiring a stake in a company in accordance with the present rules regarding takeovers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has not been easy to consider these
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0316">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>577</span>
new clauses intelligently. One has had to grab at thoughts here and there and seize examples that one has experienced. But one does not remember all the examples, and the thoughts do not penetrate completely. The new clause is drafted in such a way that it is difficult to understand and difficult to cover all those whom one wants to catch in these matters of insider dealing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that we shall all wish to consider these matters further between now and Report. I hope, therefore, that if we give the clauses our blessing at this stage with only minor criticisms we shall not be precluded from making further criticisms on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree wholeheartedly that something must be done to stop insider dealing. Many people have made considerable sums of money in the past. The nearest I ever came to insider dealing was when I was working for a public company. I purchased some shares at what then appeared to be the top of the market and had to wait three years for them to reach that price before hastily selling them, only to find that within a month their value doubled. So my own experience was not a good one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to protect those people who are legitimately involved in trading in the stock market. The Minister said that he would like to see more people purchasing and holding shares. I certainly support that. Most of the major stockbrokers have investment analysis procedures taking place all the time. Many sharp-minded people are constantly watching the market. They try to glean information about firms—to find out whether they are researching or developing particular products or projects. Very often, by piecing together the information they glean, they are able to advise people whether to buy or sell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those people are working within the law. Very often they are dealing with information which, although it is not generally known, is generally available. Their job is to ensure that that information becomes generally known. Their advice goes not only to specific individuals but also to many of the unit trusts, and indeed they often give information to the general public through the radio. One can listen to the BBC stock market report every evening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>578</span>
It is important that we look closely at what is proposed in new clause 42, to ensure that the legal position of those analysing the market is legitimised—if that is the right word—and that this is clearly expressed. They could be skating on thin ice and people might look at them with great suspicion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter which concerns these people, who may be working for stockbroking partnerships. I am not exactly a lawyer, but I believe that in the case of a partnership, the phrase "connected person "means any partner. Any partner in a stockbroking firm can reasonably be expected to know what is going on in that firm. The difference between the corporate finance department, which may well possess sensitive information on the market, and the side of the company which is engaged in straightforward dealing on the market, could be a very sensitive area. Someone working for a stockbroking partnership, engaged in analysing the market and relating various pieces of information which are generally available but not generally known, could be taken to task as a connected person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very much in favour of this measure. I hope that we can find a way to cover all the aspects. I appreciate that, even after many hours of work in this Committee, it may eventually be the courts that define exactly what the procedure should be. But I hope that the Minister can give me some assurance that these people will have some protection under the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State dealt with this matter in a very general way. I understand and sympathise with that. We are considering a highly complex piece of legal machinery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not deal with the matter in Committee stage on our Bill, so I was spared cross-examination—I am grateful for that—but I had a good deal to do with the proposals in the last Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) said, this is a different set of proposals. Nobody grumbles about that. It is right that the new Government should look at the matter afresh. The pity is that they did not do so earlier. They would then have had an opportunity to put draft clauses before the country as a whole much earlier than they did. The period of consultation in respect of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0317">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>579</span>
legislative proposals they introduced at the end of October was very brief. It had to be brief if the Government were to introduce proposals before Committee stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult, nevertheless, as the right hon. Member for Crosby said, for this Committee to give the requisite comprehensive and detailed consideration and degree of scrutiny to these proposals. I think that the Minister of State recognises that fact. No doubt he also recognises that on Report there will need to be the sort of detailed scrutiny which should, more appropriately, have taken place now. However, that is something for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noticed that, in the Minister's general statement, he did not say where the current proposals differ from the proposals in his own consultative document in October. It would be helpful if the Minister could describe those differences and say why he has departed from such proposals in material particulars. No doubt it was the result of consultation, but that is not what we want to know. We want to know the reasons for the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State said that he was open to suggestion for improving the proposals. We welcome that, because we have sufficient confidence in the Minister. Certainly, he has done an enormous amount of work in this respect—completely opposed, I suspect, by his Secretary of State, who is a generalist, does not believe in specifics and is opposed to the whole idea of detailed legislation. However, he won that battle, and I compliment him again on having done so. However, saying that the Minister of State is open to suggestion means that that will have to be translated into practice by affirming again, as I think the Under-Secretary did the other day, that the Government will not simply be open to considering matters on Report, but be prepared to enter into discussions before then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we recognise the complexity of the Government's proposals—our own proposals, too, were complex—we may be unduly anxious. After all, there is an abundance of overseas experience in dealing with insider dealing. The United States has had the most Draconian measures for many years now—since 1934. Other countries in the Commonwealth—Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, Ontario in Canada—
	<span class='label label-info column'>580</span>
have embarked upon legislation dealing with insider information, and I do not detect any great evidence that that legislalation has resulted in an inhibition of legitimate dealing or that there has been a lapse or lack of confidence in companies in those countries or in the stock exchanges of those countries. The very reason that they embarked on that legislation is that which the Government advance and which we advance for this current legislation—namely, that it is designed to enhance confidence, not diminish it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Insider dealing prevents an equality of information. Indeed, insider dealing subverts the whole basis of the free market concept upon which the Stock Exchange depends for its function. It does not provide for equality of bargaining position. That is the rationale for introducing the legislation. It is that which has caused other nations to do exactly the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If overseas experience is as I have depicted it, should we not look more closely than the Government evidently have done at the detail of that experience? I shall not embark upon the ramifications of that this morning, although I propose later to refer to one or two aspects of it that were touched on by my hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, East (Mr. Anderson) in his excellent contribution. He put forward a number of important and probing questions. They were also mentioned by the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), who made a number of characteristic and pertinent observations which the Government are bound to answer in order to satisfy the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I mention the area of agreement with the Government, I wish to take up one or two of the Minister's remarks. He said that, in my response to the proposal not to have investigators, I was being totally predictable. That may be, but it is astonishing, if so, that he cannot produce an adequate answer. It remains me of an occasion under the previous Conservative Government, when a Minister of State responsible for housing caused one of his Back Bench colleagues to put down an oral question by arrangement. His hon. Friend was so totally unsatisfied with the answer that he said that he would raise the matter on the Adjournment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a great contrast in the Government's attitude towards having inspectors for this matter and the Draconian measures that they are introducing to deal with social security frauds. But the Minister
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0318">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>581</span>
cannot get around that. Let us deal with the Bill and with what the Government's failure really means. They obviously do not like having inspectors specifically to investigate insider dealing. The Minister made a poor point when he said that this branch of the law would be dealt with quite separately from everything else. How will insider dealing be detected? What other apparatus does the Minister suggest we put in place of our proposal?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, East made some trenchant criticisms, which the Government should answer. Are the Government to rely upon the individual to bring this crime to light? That is not good enough. I am not satisfied that the machinery of sections 109 and 165 of the Companies Act 1967 represents the most effective way of dealing with the matter. Speed is of the essence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very interested in the hon. Gentleman's point, but how would the inspectors that he would have available start their work? What event would cause them to be appointed to investigate a certain transaction? Would not that investigation start in exactly the same way as it will when there is an awareness that there has been a major share scandal and it is decided to have a look at it? At some stage someone must take that decision, whether or not there are inspectors. What would have triggered the hon. Gentleman's inspectors into action?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite right. Very few investigations of fraud, or investigations under sections 109 and 165 and that panoply of legislation arise—nor, any more, do so many social security frauds, the cohabitation situations and so on—without a tip-off or a suspicion being voiced. That is how an investigation would arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour Government proposed under clause 62 of our Bill to have an expert group—people who would be largely devoting their activities to this form of investigation who would require skill and expertise. Under the provisions which the Labour Government introduced and those which the present Government are now introducing, such investigators will need skill and will need to be very familiar with the legislation and how it is working. They will need to know
	<span class='label label-info column'>582</span>
about the sort of practices which give rise to the abuse we are seeking to cure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, we proposed to set up a small cadre of people who would acquire that expertise and in addition would be able, under clause 62(3) of our Bill, to call on any person to whom it applied to give information, produce books or documents, to come before the inspectors, and to give such assistance as might have been appropriate. I have only summarised the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My difficulty is that I do not know what the Government are proposing. Perhaps the Minister can spell it out. But they do not appear to be proposing any form of inspector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do the Government intend to use the machinery of section 109? We want to know. If there is to be a crime, there must be a group of people who are able to investigate it. Will it be the police exclusively? What resources do the police have available? All these questions must be answered if we are to be satisfied that offenders can be prosecuted fully and fairly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Stevens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member agree that the central weakness of the case is that whoever is carrying out the investigation will be faced with the fact that the essential evidence in many cases will be a whispered word in the back of a taxicab, at the races, or even a bus? The sort of evidence on which such a case would rest is bound to be virtually beyond the reach of investigators, however sophisticated?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that; otherwise, there would be no point in debating these provisions. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is a fundamentalist of that kind and does not like it at all. That is not the Government's view, and it is not my view. I am not diminishing the difficulties. I am merely probing to ascertain what is to be the machinery for investigation to bring offenders before the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not press at this stage the other points made by my hon Friend. I hope that the Minister will deal with the issue of improper availability of information—the "bugging" question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I do not want to be too categoric, I believe that while our own proposals were certainly capable of improvement, and perhaps have been improved, they were more capable of ready
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0319">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>583</span>
interpretation by the courts than the proposals now before us. But that is a matter of opinion. We are not able to establish that one way or the other; it is just a feeling that one has.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mention was made earlier by my hon. Friend of the field-day, as he put it, that the lawyers might have—[An hon. Member: "Defence lawyers".]—defence lawyers, of course. It certainly would not be true of the prosecution lawyers. I do not think that the criticisms made on the earlier occasion were as cogent as the then Opposition considered. The Government now say that the information must be specific, confidential and price-sensitive, and must not generally be known to people likely to deal in the company's affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend also accept that a jury would have to be convinced beyond reasonable doubt on each of these several points?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. I have always argued—I feel it is fair to say this—in favour of the Government because our proposals would not have created a position much different from theirs, except that they would perhaps have been marginally better, marginally easier for the prosecution, but I put it no higher than that. I do not think that they would have been called for the presentation of such detailed evidence as to make a conviction possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose that both we and the Government have advanced for this set of proposals is that they alter the climate. They make people think twice about embarking this form of abuse. Our proposals would not have been perfect, and the Government's proposals are not likely to be either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same is true of a large number of criminal offences. It is difficult to procure a conviction for long-term fraud. It used to be extremely difficult to procure a conviction for simple receiving because of the defences that were available. I think that it will be difficult here to procure a conviction. But I feel that introducing these offences will have a deterrent effect in itself. At present, there is no deterrent, and clearly that is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a number of points to raise on the question of disgorgement. I have said before that I was perhaps in a minority in the Department in believing that disgorge-
	<span class='label label-info column'>584</span>
ment should be a necessary corollary of this new form of offence. I still believe that. I was not convinced by the arguments that were advanced. If one examines the experience overseas, one finds that there are disgorgement provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall that an argument was adduced that sometimes the company could not establish that it had itself suffered loss, so why should it then be a beneficiary of some form of unjustifiable enrichment? But I believe that in every case that one can conceive of the company does suffer as a result of insider dealing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My reason for believing that are based on the 	<i>obiter dicta</i> in an American case, Diamond v. Oreamuno in 1969 in the New York Court of Appeals. It was said 	<i>obiter</i> that insider dealing damages a company in so far as it damages the company's name and reputation and undermines public regard for the company's securities, so even though the real loser is the corresponding shareholder and not the company, damage is done to the company. Therefore, I join the right hon. Member for Crosby in saying that in such circumstances the shareholders at large should be entitled to benefit, even if it cannot be established that damage has been caused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put forward a proposition, which my hon. Friend did not like, that the criminal courts might be invested with the authority to impose an order for compensation if, on the specific facts, they considered that compensation should be awarded. That is not a novel proposition, because the New South Wales Securities Industry Act 1970 provides that in addition to the imposition of criminal liability, there is a liability to disgorge the profits and enable anyone suffering loss to cover their losses. The Securities Industry Act in the United States, section 94, provides that a person who is convicted of an offence under section 87, part X, shall be liable to pay compensation to any person who has purchased or sold any securities at a price affected by the act or transaction the subject of the offence for the damage suffered by him as a result of the purchase or sale, thus providing a civil remedy contingent upon prior criminal conviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is not wholly unusual to embark upon that course. I found it extraordinary that the Government should have taken so firm a stand against any civil remedy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0320">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>585</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The examples which the hon. Gentleman has given are mainly based on compensation for loss. I suggest that it would assist his argument if the matter were considered from the position of the offender being a trustee for the company. If a trustee uses funds and makes a profit for himself, the beneficiary cannot prove that he has suffered loss. He may not have made a profit, but that is not the same as suffering loss. Yet the trustee is obliged to disgorge his profits. That is how I look at the matter as affecting the directors in a case like this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the point I was coming to on the question of civil remedies. I am obliged to the right hon. Gentleman. I think that that is an unassailable argument. The Government may come forward with some riposte to it, but so far they have not done so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put a set of circumstances to the hon. Gentleman? I am a shareholder and I decide, for my own reasons, to sell my shares. Perhaps I need some money to pay my tax bill—although I need a little less than I used to, thanks to the Chancellor. So I decide to sell my shares. Four days later there is a bid or some information breaks. I sold my shares entirely willingly. No one forced me to. An insider has taken advantage of some information that he has and he makes a substantial profit. But can I really say that I made a loss when I decided, for my own reasons, to sell my shares?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but the Minister misses the entire point, which was eloquently and sufficiently made by his right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby in his intervention. We shall both have time to reflect on that and perhaps the Minister will be able to answer the debate before 1 o'clock. But that point has not been answered by the specific instance given by him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may argue that it would he difficult to establish the way in which damages are to be assessed. But again there is an abundance of overseas experience to assist us. I shall not weary the Committee by rehearsing that experience. I simply urge the Minister between now and Report to examine the information which no doubt can be obtained from his overseas posts—if it is
	<span class='label label-info column'>586</span>
not readily available here—in New South Wales, Singapore, Malaysia and the United States. They do not seem to have run into the sort of difficulties that the Government fear in this regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not propose to embark upon a recital of a number of overseas cases, because that would help the Department too much. Let it do its own research. I am getting my own back for the view the Department took on my disgorgement proposals. I see no reason why I should go out of my way to make its research job any easier. I simply say that an abundance of authority is available in courts overseas. So the Government have a lot to answer in this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn finally to certain questions which the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies have raised. No doubt, the Government are ready to answer them. A number of the questions have already been put by my right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, East and do not need to be repeated. One point which does not appear to have been answered in the Government's proposals was that in clause (E3) of the consultative document, now repeated in new clause 46—I may be out of order, Sir Stephen—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is perfectly in order in making such a reference. Everyone else has done so, so why should not he? But I hope that when we come to the specific clauses, hon. Members will bear in mind that we have discussed them pretty thoroughly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only thing I dissent from is that we have discussed them at all. Of course, we have discussed generalities, but we have not discussed the detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause (E3) provided that references to dealing in securities were to include dealing through an investment exchange. We do not dissent from the proposition that the prohibition should extend to dealings of this character. But one of the features of the definition of an investment exchange is that the identity of the subscribers is not revealed. I wonder whether it is necessary to include that particular aspect of the matter, and consider that if it remains it could constitute a loophole if any investment exchange were to change its rules for subscribers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0321">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>587</span>
The definition of securities, as it appears in clause (E4), remains in these proposals and includes shares and debentures and the right to
	<br><blockquote><p>"call for or make delivery of a share or debenture".</p></blockquote>
Would it not be helpful if the definition were specifically to refer to options, thereby making it manifest that the prohibition extends also to option dealings as well as dealings in rights attaching to securities themselves?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That, in my view, is a cogent point, and I hope that the Minister will be as receptive as he indicated at the beginning of his speech he would be to consider the suggestions that I, my hon. Friend and the right hon. Member for Crosby have made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman understands "shares" to mean only listed shares. The definition starts in that way but it then refers to "all the other shares". It is an extraordinary definition. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has construed it in any way. The principle of the clause has been that only listed shares are concerned. From the definition it would seem to spread over all the rest of the shares.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am unhappy about that but that is a point for the Government rather than for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been an interesting and wide ranging debate. I intend to deal with all the points that I can but as a result my speech may be rather long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I start with some specific points made by the hon. Member for Swansea, East (Mr. Anderson). I congratulate him on the thoroughness with which he had studied new clause 42 and on the work which, clearly, he put into his opening remark. He asked about what he called the "nod and wink" type of information. I refer him to subsection (6) which reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"an individual who is for the time being prohibited by any provisions of this section from dealing on a recognised stock exchange … shall not counsel or procure any other person to deal on a recognised stock exchange in those securities."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the chap in the golf club who said, "By
	<span class='label label-info column'>588</span>
the way, take my advice. I know about these things. I cannot tell you why, but buy X", and whether that type of advice would be caught. If the person who is in possession of price-sensitive information fell within the provisions of the clause he would effectively be counselling or procuring someone else to deal and I am advised that as a result he would be caught by subsection (6).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are we to have a formal definition of nodding and winking?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Whips' Office, says on these occasions, not today. When one wants to get away and asks for a pair, it can be arranged any time, except today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to some of the smaller points raised by the hon. Gentleman. The first relates to the chairman. Let us say that the chairman, who is the linchpin of the business, having built it up, tells his fellow directors that he is critically ill and that they must start to think about who is to succeed him. At that point, if he were such a key figure, the directors would be in the possession of price-sensitive information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman recited a list of the people who supported our new clauses as evidence that they must be wrong. I do not accept that criticism. They are distinguished bodies. The list includes the Law Society, the accountancy bodies, the CBI and so on. The hon. Gentleman said that if all those people supported it it must be wrong. That is a fairly sweeping assertion; I can only say that I do not agree with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is notable that although many people had strong reservations about these proposals they now find them acceptable, not on the grounds that they see that there is something they can get away with in our proposals, but because they feel that we have met certain points and made the proposals more specific and improved the definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made great play of the difficulty of distinguishing between "general" and "specific". He wondered whether it would be a defence lawyer's delight. I do not suspect—the American experience suggests that I am right—that there will be a huge lucrative, brand new practice at the Bar—namely, defenders of insider dealers. I say that because I do not believe that this is wide-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0322">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>589</span>
spread. I do not expect to see a flood of prosecutions every day before the courts. I do not feel that the courts will have the difficulty that the hon. Gentleman appeared to have in deciding whether information is general or specific. It was the one part of his speech of which I thought he made heavy weather.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether companies should be caught by the provisions. We gave that matter careful consideration. As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, the prohibitions set out in the clauses apply only to individuals. But it should not therefore be concluded that if transactions are conducted in the name of the company they will not he caught by the provisions. The provisions will apply to the individuals who act for the company. Therefore, whilst the company cannot commit an offence, those acting for it can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of restricting the prohibitions to individuals is to avoid the considerable complexities that arise when companies are prohibited from dealing. The requirement of knowledge, in particular, raises problems when applied to companies. One has to move away from actual knowledge to imputed knowledge. The company itself, though a corporate entity, can have no actual knowledge of anything. In various areas of the law the company may be held to have imputed knowledge—for example, if its directors hold certain information. In other areas it might be held to have imputed knowledge of what any of its employees know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having considered all the facts, we came to the conclusion that, so long as we had the right to take action against the directors who acted for the company, we were probably restricting ourselves in a way which would make the provisions effective. If we had opened up the whole question of companies, we could have had considerable additional problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) asked if I could give him a list of the changes that we have made between the Bill and the consultative document. We gave him that last week. It is a two-page document. I hope that he will agree that I should not weary the Committee by reading it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both hon. Members asked how we shall investigate insider dealing without the benefit of an inspectorate. The De-
	<span class='label label-info column'>590</span>
partment has investigating officers and people in the solicitor's prosecution branch who are already experts in dealing with company fraud, and with other offences under the Companies Act. They have a tremendous working knowledge of the area. We believe that they will quickly become familiar with the provisions of new clauses 42 to 46—as we all have, in the short time that we have had them at our disposal—and that they will not have any difficulty in extending their range of activities to cover the investigation of insiders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Such familiarity as the Minister has referred to—including his own—bodes very well for the criminal fraternity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman was trying to make a joke rather than being insulting. I shall assume that it was the former.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that what the hon. Gentleman has said is at all fair. He sought to give the impression that we were going to create a cadre of topnotch experts plucked out of the air and tune them up to be the persecutors of all insiders. What would probably have happened is that a number of the people to whom I referred would have been assigned to a special unit. The personnel involved, their range of expertise and their ability to search and ferret out facts would therefore be no different. In addition to the Department's own staff, we expect, and know that we shall receive, the co-operation of the Stock Exchange and other bodies affected by the legislation. The Department also has a very good, long-standing working relationship with the fraud squad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore do not believe that we shall have difficulty in enforcing these provisions because of the absence of an inspectorate. A range of people able to do this is already available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) and the hon. Member for Hackney, Central raised the question of civil remedies and disgorgement. I must say to my right hon. Friend that I personally find the idea attractive and am still open-minded about it. But the arguments against it are very strong—I saw a look of alarm appearing on certain faces as I spoke just then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0323">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>591</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do not worry about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not. I mentioned in my opening remarks the problem of relating the person making the loss to the person making the profit. The hon. Gentleman did not accept my example, but I pointed out that there could be cases in which a person would find it very difficult to establish that he had made a loss although the insider had undoubtedly made a profit. Linking the insider and the person who may have been his victim is therefore not easy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I point out to my right hon. Friend and to the hon. Gentleman that we envisage substantial criminal penalties which are themselves designed to ensure that insider dealing is not a paying proposition. The fine on summary conviction is only £1,000, but it is open to the prosecution to insist upon trial on indictment. In that case, there is no limit to the size of the fine on conviction. So there is the possibility of society, through the courts, depriving the offender of his profits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also other possibilities. Under the Crown Courts Act 1973, the court in which a person is convicted may make an order requiring the person to pay compensation for any loss or damage arising from that defence. But the order must be made in favour of an identified person. If such a person can be identified, therefore, my legal advice is that the court can already order the person convicted to pay compensation to the person damaged provided that that person can be identified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend spoke of finding a way to make the person disgorge his profit to the company, to be held by the directors as trustee for the shareholders. As I said earlier, it is an approach that we have adopted to loans and to profits arising from any of the transactions that we made illegal under the earlier clauses. But I think that the possibility of severe penalties on conviction and the possibility, if the victim can be identified, of the court being able to order compensation constitute a fairly formidable battery of deterrents to the would-he insider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My recollection is that the power of the court to award
	<span class='label label-info column'>592</span>
compensation is limited to a certain figure. I have an idea that that figure was at one time £400, and that it was increased under recent legislation. I am sure there is some limit to the amount of compensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that that is in the magistrates' courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his legal advice. I am advised that it is in the magistrates' courts that that limit of £400 applies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened, and will continue to listen, very carefully to my right hon. Friend. But I hope he will feel that there are possibilities within the existing law and that what we propose represents a major deterrent to the would-be insider. That is, after all, our main aim. We are not seeking a chance to fill the courts with a flood of insiders. We are trying to demonstrate to people who are contemplating becoming insiders that there is a high price to be paid if they do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hackney, Central asked whether the Department would be prepared to use section 109 of the 1967 Act to get information about insider dealing. I am advised that the powers under section 109 merely enable the Department to require a company to produce books and papers and to answer question or give explanations about their contents. It is most unlikely that the information one might acquire in that way would be relevant to insider deals. The relevant information would be about the dealings and the tips and what was known to the insider at the relevant time. We would not exclude the possibility of using section 109 if we felt that it would be helpful. I thank the hon. Member for reminding me and my officials of that possibility. It is at our disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to my right hon. Friend's point about the company director and his egg-cracking wife. Or was it the husband who was cracking the egg?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point about the constraints imposed by section 109. As he rightly said, that section only empowers the inspectors to obtain documents and so on and make certain inquiries of the company. That was why I suggested including some form of power comparable to that in clause 62 in the old
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0324">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>593</span>
Bill. It is the power to make inquiries of the person or persons concerned that is critical. Is that to be left to the police? Do they have skills sufficient to enable them to do this job purposefully and meaningfully?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The companies investigation branch would simply utilise some of its people who would be more exclusively concerned with this aspect of the matter than almost any other. They would be familiar with this area. If they had some powers comparable to those in the last Bill they would be able to make their investigations directly of the people concerned. There is a lacuna here which worries me enormously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman. I shall study his remarks and take advice about them, and consider whether what he suggests would strengthen the legislation in a worthwhile manner. I shall write to him about the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to my right hon. Friend's point about the wife and her egg-cracking company director husband. I devoted a major part of my opening remarks to this area, which I believe to be the critical area. I am very anxious indeed that we should not discourage directors and employees from holding shares in the companies for which they work. I have personally given considerable attention to this area, as has my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The gist of my opening remarks was that the definition in new clause 42 of the sort of information that one has to have at one's disposal is very specific. I do not believe that knowledge about the day-to-day running of a business falls into that category. A person who works in the dispatch department of a company may see a lot of goods going out. The sales manager may know that the sales figures are better. But I do not think that such things really move the shares as they would need to be moved to attract an insider. I believe that the information that matters is about specific important events.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked what would happen if a company had been built around one person who was the moving spirit behind it, and the directors suddenly found out that he was going to die. In a small business, that would
	<span class='label label-info column'>594</span>
be a major event. That could be "price sensitive information". But, if I may say so, the news that the chairman of a huge company with a huge management structure was ill would probably not have the same impact on that price. This is why trying to be more specific would be dangerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the general body of information which a businessman has about his business for long periods of the year falls into the bracket of "unpublished price sensitive information". Of course he knows more about his business than people outside do, but the kind of knowledge we are after is knowledge of dramatic events, major happenings, and things which will transform the company's prospects. When someone has information about such matters, he should not be dealing. But I do not believe that the day-to-day running of major enterprises is full of day-to-day dramas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that a considerable body of important opinion shares our view. But we shall have to see how the law works. My right hon. Friend and I differ on this point, but that is not because the Government have not considered it. We feel that those who make the point are overstating it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I am overstating the case if I put to my hon. Friend the example of the employee who knows that the new electronic invention is being developed behind closed doors in the factory—many employees may know all about it, and it may be a very important matter to the outside person—or of the director who knows that the company is negotiating for the purchase of an important property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend talked about major events affecting a company. But we have to consider, under his definition in new clause 46, things which are "likely materially to affect" the company. I would have thought that that could mean something much less than a major event.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think my right hon. Friend is slightly missing the point I am making. New clause 46 does not refer to events which are likely materially to affect the company. The words are:
	<br><blockquote><p>"likely materially to affect the price".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0325">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>595</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am talking about important transactions. A company might be developing a new project which could transform its expectations. I was in Yorkshire yesterday visiting a company that has developed a product which it has been marketing for a long time. The product is a world leader—it is a magnificent micrometer—developed by James Neill and Son Ltd. It is enjoying worldwide success. All credit to the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such events do not happen every day in the history of a company. A company is not developing a new invention every day, about to make a takeover or to do something that would move the price. It is occurrences which affect the price that matter. Does my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby think that events which move the price are likely to be a daily occurrence or even a regular occurrence, to the extent that they inhibit those in the company from dealing in its shares? That is the point of difference between us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to a technical area. My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby raised a point about the position of trustees. I am advised that there are two or three points that I might make to him on the matter, but I am not sure that they answer his query. If they do not, perhaps he would raise the matter again and I shall try to deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that trustees have to come within subsections (8) and (11) only if they have information which they know is unpublished, price-sensitive information which, under the Bill, would preclude them from dealing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, regarding an explicit provision to protect trustees, we agreed that a trustee does not owe a beneficiary a duty to exploit information when to do so would be a criminal offence. We do not agree with the Law Society—
	<span class='label label-info column'>596</span>
although we are open to persuasion—that the position needs to be made clear. There then follows a sentence in my advice—which I find baffling, but I am assured is relevant—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Trustees do not have to rob banks to enrich the beneficiaries; equally they must not break this law."</p></blockquote>
If I see a smile of satisfaction coming over my right hon. Friend's face, I am delighted. It will prove to him that he understands the answer, even if I do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to my right hon. Friend's remarks about what he called the "takeover clause" subsection (4). I should like time to consider those remarks. He raised a point of importance which I shall consider, and I shall get in touch with him about it. If he and the Department agree we shall bring forward an amendment on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, East (Mr. Bright) raised points concerning financial analysis and partnerships. The Stock Exchange, in its representations on the previous Bill, made it quite clear that this activity—that is, discussions between company executives and analysts—is carried on at present quite legitimately without there being any leakage of confidential information. The rules of the Stock Exchange bear very strictly on company directors in that respect. The Stock Exchange is saying that it does not expect company directors to provide to analysts price-sensitive, unpublished information of the kind that would be covered by the new clause, or that any such—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
