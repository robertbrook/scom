	<div class='debates'>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric G. Valley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Good hew. At the start of the last sitting, you were kind enough to allow me to raise a point of order so that I might ask about proposed changes to the Bill. Because of your tolerance, we were able to proceed for a short time, and the Under-Secretary was able to intervene on a point of order and give us some indication as to what was likely to happen to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past few days, there have been further reports that the Government are contemplating changes. I suggest that it would be for the convenience of the Committee and certainly for the more orderly proceeding of the Bill if I were to move that the debate be now adjourned so that we may raise the matter and perhaps have a reply from the Secretary of State for Employment, who could not be here last week for reasons that we understand and accept? Would you accept that motion, Mr. Goodhew?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In responding to the right hon. Gentleman, which I do quite agreeably and say that I shall be prepared to accept such a motion, perhaps I may say that the Chair understands that very strong feelings are held on both sides of the Committee on various parts of the Bill and is appreciative of the restrained way in which business is being conducted and the constructive debates that have taken place. Therefore, I do not feel that I can any longer deny hon. and right hon. Members the opportunity of carrying out a certain exercise in an orderly rather than a disorderly fashion, and I hope that we can dispose of the matter in not too great a time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>162</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Valley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged, Mr. Goodhew. I beg to move, That the debate be now adjourned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Seven weeks ago we gave the Bill a Second Reading in the House of Commons, and subsequently those of us who are members of this Committee were charged with giving it detailed consideration. It has been said more than once that the Bill hangs together in the sense that we have to look at ballots in relation to union membership agreements and picketing and all the other proposals contained in it. We can do that only if we are kept informed about any changes that the Government propose to make to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that on Second Reading the Secretary of State hinted that changes could be made during the passage of the Bill, although he was not very specific, and perhaps for accuracy I should quote what he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Last Thursday the House of Lords gave its judgment in the case of Express Newspapers v. Mac-Shane. This case raised issues of central importance to our review. We are now considering their Lordships' judgment carefully. We shall take whatever action seems necessary in the light of that judgment and bring it before the House in due course. There are vital and delicate matters which will require a great deal of thought."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 December 1979; Vol. 976, c. 68.]</p></blockquote>
There was no suggestion at that time—because that was when it was first mooted that we would have changes—that within five weeks the Government would be bringing them forward. It is very contentious, and I suppose that the situation in the steel industry has heightened the discussion of the proposed changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the main, as I said on Second Reading and previously in the Committee, I do not think that this legislation is all that good. To impose on the trade unions vexatious legislation which will in the main be unworkable, as a Tory Government are doing for the second time in under 10 years, will cause a deterioration in industrial relations. There is evidence that the Secretary of State for Employment understands that. On second Reading he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is not a measure designed to change the whole structure of industrial relations. It is not a measure to clobber the unions. It is neither doctrinaire nor draconian. In 1974, when the Trade Union and Labour Relations Bill had completed its passage, I urged my party which was in opposition, to stick to it, to accept it as a solid foundation. It would have met the desire of Parliament to settle the question and put an end to damaging and divisive dispute …If we fail, we shall condemn ourselves to a

	<span class='label label-info column'>163</span>
continuing struggle that will sap the strength of our nation." 	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 December 1979; vol. 976, c.71.]</p></blockquote>
There is no doubt that the right hon. Gentleman understands that in this area one must move, if one has to move at all, in an extremely delicate way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has been on television and radio recently. I have no objection to that, as I said last week, provided that others have a fair opportunity of putting a contrary point of view. But he was reported at some length in yesterday's newspapers, and accordingly to the 	<i>Financial Times,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>"He stresses, on BBC Radio's The World This Weekend that industrial relations problems had to be put right with a great seal of sensitivity. If the Government got its industrial relations policy wrong this time the outlook for the country would be very bleak."</p></blockquote>
He was reported in 	<i>The Times</i> as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I cannot stress too strongly that if the Government gets its industrial relations policy wrong this time round the outlook for the country is very bleak indeed …If we suddenly tried to push two or three clauses of this particular Bill through Parliament now, in a great rush on picketing and immunities, then it would be immediately highlighted in the public and union mind and I think would almost certainly fail as a result."</p></blockquote>
That is really the issue that we should debate on the motion that you have accepted, Mr. Good hew. It is a question of trying to find out the Government's intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that the Secretary of State is under a great deal of pressure. Perhaps he is not master in his House. We know from the Walden interview that The Prime Minister takes a particularly hard line. That interview, known in the trade as the entrepreneurial Good Samaritan interview, was the one in which she said that, good Samaritans were only good if they had cash.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Industry, too, is reported in the newspapers as being one of the hawks in all this. He has the steel industry round his neck in a big way, and he is looking to the Secretary of State for Employment to get him out of his difficulty. The Secretary of State will tell us whether he is or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>164</span>
In today's 	<i>Daily Mail,</i> one of the very experienced Lobby correspondents—I had better give him his full title: Gordon Gering, political editor—states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But behind the scenes, Mr. Prior is at loggerheads with Industry Secretary Sir Keith Joseph. He appears to feel that he has been cast as a convenient scapegoat for a strike that might have been settled some time ago if Sir Keith had been less aloof."</p></blockquote>
I have no doubt that there is some truth in that and that there had been some briefing of Mr. Gordon Gering of the 	<i>Daily Mail.</i>
On page 2 of the 	<i>Daily Mail,</i> we see that, far from the Secretary of State for Industry not being involved in that dispute, the Granada Television programme showed last night that the Government are up to their necks in it:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It was alleged that the corporation was preparing for a 14 per cent. pay rise for the steelmen—which would have averted the strike—but were prevented by Industry Secretary Sir Keith Joseph from putting it on the table."</p></blockquote>
At face value, one may say that that is just a newspaper story, but further on in the article we see a report of comments by Sir Charles Villagers:
	<br><blockquote><p>"BSC chairman Sir Charles Villagers said last night: 'It was not a totally unfair programme. We got a pretty fair hearing. I did not learn anything I did not already know. No new information has been revealed. Most of the programme was accurate."</p></blockquote>
So here we have the chairman of the British Steel Corporation telling us that the Secretary of State for Industry has prevented him from bringing the steel dispute to a conclusion. On the front page we are told that he is trying to put all the blame on the Secretary of State for Employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is concern also about the Government's intentions for this Bill, and I understand that there is a call from the Back Benches for immediate action. On today's Order Paper there is a motion in the name of the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Mr. Marlow), and 44 Conservative Party Members, highly critical of the Government, are calling upon Her Majesty's Government to introduce immediate legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is what we want to know from the Secretary of State. Are we to have whatever changes he proposes in an orderly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0591">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>165</span>
way, trying to deal with the sensitive arrangements that exist in industrial relations, or are we to have immediate legislation, as 44 Conservative Members of Parliament want, and as one member of this Committee wants? the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) is nodding agreement; he signed the motion, too. We actually have a member of the Committee who is dissatisfied with the way that the Government are approaching the matter, and he wants the Government to hold to this Bill, without great amendments, and introduce immediate legislation. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will let us know his views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have already said, it looks as though we have pressure from the Prime Minister, it looks as though we have pressure from some of the Secretary of State's Cabinet colleagues, we have pressure from 44 Conservative Members of Parliament, and we have pressure from one member of this Committee, asking the Government to come forward with immediate legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other outside pressures, too. Sir John Methuen, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, is now clamouring for immediate legislation. I must say that I despair every time the director-general of the CBI goes on television or the radio and I hear the way he bellyaches on about industrial relations. He started off a few months ago saying that the CBI had everything it had asked for from this Government, and now he is not satisfied with that; he wants to create more difficulties for the Secretary of State. I think that those of us who have been round this course previously ought to refer Sir John Methuen to the wise words that were used by his predecessor, Sir Campbell Adamson, in referring to the Industrial Relations Act 1971, when he said that it had soured and sullied industrial relations. Sir John Methuen ought to look at the record at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are now contemplating something. I do not say that industrial relations are not difficult at this time: Of course, they are difficult. It is an indisputable fact that under Conservative Governments industrial relations always deteriorate. One has only to trace the figures from 1945 right through to the present time. More days are lost through strikes when there is a Conservative Government in power. In fact, I think that under the tender ministrations of the pres-
	<span class='label label-info column'>166</span>
ent Government about 21 million working days have been lost so far, much more than twice the number of days lost in the worst year of the previous Labour Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the Committee is entitled to know what changes are contemplated in the Bill and when they will be announced. Will the Secretary of State come forward with immediate legislation to meet the views of his colleagues on the Back Benches and his colleague in this Committee? Has he yet been to his Cabinet colleagues with his proposals? We do not know that yet from the newspapers. It may well be that the Secretary of State has a paper prepared which will be taken at some Cabinet or Cabinet Committee meeting this week, and he must be on tenterhooks to know how it will go. Surely, the Committee is entitled to know when that is to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we do not like the Bill, if we are to consider it properly and in detail, and if it is to emerge from the Committee as a measure which will not unnecessarily damage industrial relations, the time has come for the Secretary of State to tell us what pressures he is under, what proposals he has to make, and when we are likely to see them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley). As he says, the Opposition strongly believe that the whole Bill hangs together as a package, and it is essential that we see the new proposals before we reach the end of our debate on clause 1 so that we may look at clause 1 in the light of the new suggestions which the Secretary of State is bringing forward. It seems to me that the Committee is probably learning less about the progress of the Government's thinking on the whole question of industrial relations than are many other people outside. My right hon. Friend has already quoted from several newspaper reports. I shall quote from another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> this morning has what seems to be an extremely well informed story by its political correspondent, rather in line with other stories we have heard, so I think we can assume that a good deal of briefing is going on. I do not complain about that, even though only part of the Government seems to be doing the briefing at any one time. It says:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0592">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>167</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The gradualist approach of Mr. Prior, Employment Secretary, to trade union reform is being questioned by some other ministers in the light of the steel strike. He faces a possible Cabinet battle if he insists on putting forward only limited amendments to the Employment Bill.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Prior's policy has been put under new strain by the extension of the steel strike to private companies, the greater use of flying pickets and the call by the Confederation of British Industry for 'profound changes' in the law on trade unions."</p></blockquote>
It then adds:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Coming as it did from one of the most important employers' organisations, the CBI call is believed to have struck a particular chord with the Prime Minister".</p></blockquote>
It would not, I think, take much to bring the Prime Minister into tune with the more extreme views on these matters. That is the kind of view which she has already expressed publicly. The story goes on to talk about Mr. Prior drafting amendment; it talks about discussions with his supporters and the views of his opponents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, only at the weekend, we had a long "Weekend World" programme on television in which we were treated to all the differences between the so-called hawks and doves over this issue. Yet within the Committee we are told nothing. We have no first-hand knowledge of how these matters are progressing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the Secretary of State's dilemma. If 	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> is right, this is likely to be discussed by the Cabinet on Thursday. The Secretary of State may not be able to confirm that but, if that is so, we appreciate that it is a little difficult for him to come here today with a document, because it has not been rubber-stamped—if rubber-stamped is the word in these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is a dilemma for us, too, and it is one for the Secretary of State to resolve rather than the Committee. To some extent, we are discussing these matters in a vacuum, and it has to be filled. If we must wait for the Cabinet to make its decision on these documents, it does not seem unreasonable that the Committee should hold its fire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no dire urgency in what we are doing in terms of a week or so, if that is how long it will take. By then we could presumably have the consultative document before us, and I suggest that that might be the best course for us to take. It would solve the Secretary of State's dilemma, and it would solve the difficult-
	<span class='label label-info column'>168</span>
ties which the Committee is experiencing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take only a minute or two, and I intervene merely to indicate that the puzzlement and disturbance felt about the strange situation in which the Committee finds itself is not confined to our Front Bench. I feel like a Member in the early stages of the Committee stage of a Finance Bill, after hearing an announcement that, before the Committee is concluded, the Chancellor of the Exchequer will seriously consider getting rid of the PAYE system and requiring all taxpayers to queue up every Friday morning at the office of the local collector of taxes in order to pay their tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may sound a bit exaggerated but, as we understand it and as far as we are able to unravel the mysteries, what is being considered will make as much difference to this Bill as the rather fanciful example which I have given would make to a Finance Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is grossly unfair to members of the Committee on both sides that we should be put into this position in which every word we utter between now and the time that we have some clarification of this matter is a waste of breath.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I briefly pick up the words quoted from 	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant)—"profound changes" in trade union law. I read the letter in 	<i>The Times</i> yesterday from Professor Wedderburn in which he talks of the golden rule of British industrial law which goes back over a century. Our industrial relations law has been based on it for over a century. It was reaffirmed in the Act of 1906 passed by the Liberal majority. Again, our Liberal colleague is not here to confirm that, but I believe it to be true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears that there are now moves—though we do not hear about them in this Committee, which seems to be some sort of sideshow—being conducted elsewhere. Unfortunately, I do not get time to watch television, and I feel very deprived by that. Sometimes we have difficulty in reading all the newspapers, and there are all sorts of reports of intentions to change the whole of our law in a profound way so that the Bill we have here is really is not very important. We are just discussing a few side-issues because we understand that something of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0593">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>169</span>
far greater import is in the offing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That being so, I should have thought that it would be far better to bring such changes before the House in a separate Bill so that the whole House could give its view on Second Reading. That is the correct procedure, rather than to tack it on somehow to this Bill and change the whole nature of it. If there is something to which we are not privy at the moment which, will profoundly change the whole nature of the Bill, it could well affect our attitude to clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Giles Radices</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is good that we are having this debate because it is important that we know what is going on. My hon. Friends have explained some of the background, and, of course, I have great sympathy for the Secretary of State, whom I admire. He is probably my favourite Cabinet Minister. I am sure that will do him a lot of good in his own party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, there are a number of pressures. There are contradictory judgments in the courts, there is the steel dispute and what the steel industry is asking for, and there are the Tory backwoodsmen. Perhaps it is wrong to call somebody so well dressed and suave as the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) a backwoodsman, but his views are somewhat primitive. Clearly, the Secretary of State has a lot of difficulties, and we all sympathise with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is entitled to know what is going on. We are told that the Secretary of State wants to get it right. He wants changes which will last, which will not be thrown out by the incoming Labour Government. I do not know what he is after. If he is after minor and limited changes, there is a case for bringing them forward straight away. We could then proceed. If there are to be major changes, such as those my hon. Friend has talked about, it is in a sense an outrage to this Committee, because what is being suggested is an entirely new Bill. If that is the case and, in effect, a new Bill is being suggested, we are doing nothing very much here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must make up their mind. The key date is Thursday, when, I understand from the newspapers, the Cabinet will be looking at the consultative document. If that is the case, the Committee ought to adjourn until the Cabinet has made up its mind what it intends to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>170</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right honourable and hon. Friends are in some difficulty. The Secretary of State bears a heavy responsibility in this matter, but we are aware of the enormous pressures he is under. We recognise that we have to treat it with kid gloves in case we further undermine right hon. Gentleman's position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friends have said, it is essential that the Secretary of State informs us what his intentions are in relation to the statement he made on Second Reading, part of which was quoted by my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley). In reply to an intervention by one of his hon. Friends the Member for Rutland and Stamford (Mr. Lewis), the Secretary of State said, referring to the House of Lords judgment in Express Newspapers v. MacShane:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This case raised issues of central importance to our review. We are now considering their Lordships' judgment carefully. We shall take whatever action seems necessary in the light of that judgment and bring it before the House in due course. There are vital and delicate matters which will require a great deal of thought."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 December, 1979; Vol 976, c.68.]</p></blockquote>
We understand the Secretary of State's desire to treat these matters with a great deal of thought, but that is not a view shared by many of his right honourable and hon. Friends both in the Cabinet and on the Back Benches. Early-day motion No. 375, initiated by the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Mr. Marlow),
	<br><blockquote><p>"calls upon Her Majesty's Government, in accord-acne with over-whelming popular demand, to intro-duce immediate legislation to restore industrial equity."</p></blockquote>
This is the key to the dilemma the Committee faces. There is a demand from a substantial section of the Conservative Party for immediate legislation. No one is sure what the legislation should be. The Secretary of State has the appalling dilemma that he recognises that even if this Bill were on the statute book it would be no use to him in the current dispute that is occupying the thoughts of the British Steel Corporation and of the Conservative Party. It would make no difference at all, and the Secretary of State is well aware of these problems. He has difficulty convincing many members of his own party. It is important that the moderates in the Conservative Party who support the Secretary of State should stand up and be counted and help the Secretary of State in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0594">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>171</span>
this appalling dilemma over the next two or three weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friends that it will be a constitutional outrage if the Secretary of State seeks to introduce into this Bill profound changes in trade union law. We are opposing large parts of this Bill, and we should oppose any new Bill that he proposed. We have a right to put to him as strongly as we can that if there are profound changes to be made—I shall be interested to see just what he tries to do—they should take the form of a new Bill and should not be introduced into this Bill before the Committee.

As my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) said, it is essential that we know the Government's intention as quickly as possible. I remind the Committee that we on this side are not opposed to every aspect of the Bill. We are looking at the Bill as a package, but it is important that we know what the package contains. Otherwise, as my hon. Friend said earlier, how can we arrive at a realistic decision in relation to clause 1 which relates to balloting unless we see the total package? The Secretary of State has a duty to let us know his intentions as quickly as possible and to inform us whether he seeks to alter the Bill radically on immunities, picketing and secondary blacking or whether he proposes to adopt the method of introducing a new Bill.

The Secretary of State faces appalling difficulty. Looking at the events in the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords and the judgment on the private steel sector, I am struck with the thought that if the Master of the Rolls who at 81 has spent a lifetime on the Bench is incapable of interpreting the law correctly, how on earth are ordinary working men and women in factories, shipyards and steelworks to interpret the law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the Labour Government's law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the point I am making. I am saying that if the Master of the Rolls is incapable of interpreting the law correctly how on earth can ordinary men and women in our factories and steelworks interpret the law correctly? This is
	<span class='label label-info column'>172</span>
the appalling dilemma for the Secretary of State. When he enters into that delicate field, he faces the problem of trying to get on to the statute book a law which can be correctly interpreted by everyone. We know that he will fail. The Tory Party is demanding some law, any law, as long as it tries to stop people striking. It does not work like that. It is not as simple as that. We want to know from the Secretary of State what he proposes to do in relation to this Bill, and we say that it would be a constitutional outrage if he sought to amend it by introducing major changes on trade union legislation in a bill which had its Second Reading six or seven weeks ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervene briefly to urge the Secretary of State to be frank when he replies to the motion moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley). One can understand that he is not in a position at this stage to spell out to the Committee what the amendments are likely to be, but we are entitled to know the timetable of events. I presume that the matter will come to the next meeting of the Cabinet, that a discussion will be held and, after that Cabinet meeting, the Government will be in a position to set out the drastic amendments to the Bill that everyone is forecasting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what we read in the newspapers about the acute differences between the two sides—the hawks and the doves—it is possible that the Cabinet will not be able to make an early decision. The Committee will then continue to be left in this situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming precisely to that point. I was about to suggest that, when the Secretary of State publishes his diaries in 10 years' time, we shall no doubt be able to sort out the doves from the hawks, and it will probably make even more interesting reading than the diaries which have been published so far. We do not know. We are not privy to what goes on in the Cabinet. But certainly we know from the timetable that, as far as our deliberations are concerned today and on Thursday, we shall be wasting our time discussing the shadow of what eventually may be a much tougher Bill than the one now before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are therefore justified in saying that at least there should be an adjournment
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0595">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>173</span>
of the Committee until a week today. There is no necessity to meet on Thursday when the Cabinet is meeting. No doubt, we shall in any case be deprived of the services of the Secretary of State, who will be defending his corner in the Cabinet. So there is good ground for saying let us have the real Bill as quickly as possible so that we can get down to business. We are not likely to get that at least until a week from today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not expect the Secretary of State to spell out what the amendments will be, but we expect him to spell out a timetable. I hope that he will be frank with the Committee and let us know where he stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. James Prior)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I thank the Opposition for their felicitations. Secondly, I thank them for making it unnecessary for me to bother to read the morning papers. I can come to the Committee and be regaled with all the news that is in them—not only for today but for several days past. It will save me quite a bit of work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has read them all right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I can say, to the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) is that I thought, and had hoped, that my hon. and learned Friend had explained the situation in the short discussion that we had last Thursday in the Committee. But I should like to make plain that, ever since the House of Lords ruled in the case of Express Newspapers v. MacShane, the Government have been considering what action is necessary. I gave a warning on Second Reading, which the right hon. Gentleman has quoted. The Government are preparing their proposals, which they will issue in a consultative document within the next few days. There will then be an opportunity for those most affected by it—the trade unions, the CBI, the employers and workers generally—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Wait a second—and only after that would the Government put down amendments in good time for the Committee to examine them before coming to a decision. We expect, as one does with important matters introduced into
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
the House, to give at least two weekends' notice of the amendments so that the Committee will have a proper and fair opportunity to assess them, probably in the form of a new clause to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could my right hon. Friend say how many days or weeks he imagines that the period of consultation might be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not want to be firm on that. I recognise that the country expects this Committee to get on with its work a bit more quickly. There would have to be a reasonable period. It is not as if the country was already fairly well versed on the subject of immunities, given the publicity of the past few days and weeks. It would not take long to get the views of the TUC and CBI. As my hon. Friend knows, we have tried to carry people with us throughout the passage of this legislation. Before it was introduced we had various consultative documents. I believe that that has been absolutely the right way to carry the country with us. The very fact that the Bill commands such wide support is an indication that we have tried to carry people with us, and we shall go on trying to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that while the Committee is sitting it should have a look at the proposals in advance of their being made available to the general public. I intend to see that each member of the Committee has a copy of the proposals before they are issued to the general public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Secretary of State will withdraw his remark that the general public want the Committee to get on more quickly than it has done so far. We understand the right hon. Gentleman's difficulties, but if he had been to the Committee regularly he would, I am sure, share the appreciation of his hon. Friends that the debates so far on clause 1 have been worthwhile, and the amendments have been so good that the Government have accepted two of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Frankly, what the right hon. Gentleman has said so far is not good enough. It seems that he is now stretching a fairly lengthy timetable before the Committee. Obviously, one of the things which we want to know from the right hon. Gentleman is what sort of timetable is involved, but if he expects to introduce the sort of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0596">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>175</span>
amendments that the Prime Minister has threatened the trade union movement with and get them through with a short period of consultation—one wonders how short is "short"—he has another think coming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that in what I propose I shall be treating the Committee in a most responsible and reasonable manner. I must say to the hon. Gentleman, if he does not believe that there is a certain impatience in the country with the speed at which this legislation is being taken, he obviously does not read the same newspapers as I read, and I had gathered from the general tenor of their remarks this morning that hon. Members did in fact read the same newspapers as I read.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that one can argue that there is not a degree of impatience in the country as a whole to get on with the Bill. I suggest that Parliament will do itself no good if it does not recognise that the country is impatient for the Government's proposals to be put on the statute book, and the sooner the better, as long as there is a proper debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am now more puzzled than I was before. If the right hon. Gentleman is assuring us that any proposed amendments or new clauses which he brings before the Committee arise not out of the current hysteria because of the steel strike or anything of that kind but out of the position created by the Lords' judgment in Express Newspapers v. MacShane, why on earth did the Government not do it before they introduced the Bill in the first place? This has me completely puzzled. If the new clauses or amendments arose out of something which happened this week or last week, since Second Reading, I could understand it, but the opportunity was there before the Second Reading to get the Bill into the shape that the Government wanted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but he is wrong. The Bill was introduced at the beginning of December. The Second Reading took place on 17 December. The House of Lords judgment in Express Newspapers v. MacShane was given on 13 December.
	<span class='label label-info column'>176</span>
So it was simply not possible to put it in the original Bill. We felt strongly, for reasons which are abundantly clear, that we ought to get on with the Bill. In fact, if any criticism is to be levelled at my head, it is that we ought to have got on with the Bill more quickly than we have, but I believe that we have handled the consultations and the working papers in the best possible way from the point of view of all the interested parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that anything which we may bring forward on immunities is likely to have the slightest effect on clauses 1, 2, 3 or 4 of the Bill, and it does not do us any good to think that we have to see what is going to happen on immunities in order to make progress on the early clauses of the Bill. It would be totally unreasonable if that view were accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is more, let me say this to the hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans), who said that he did not know what proposal the Government would bring forward on secondary picketing. If he has read the Bill, he knows what proposal we are putting forward on secondary picketing because it is in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will not work, and the right hon. Gentleman knows it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fact, on secondary picketing we quite clearly state our proposal that the immunities under section 13 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act will not apply to picketing done by people away from their place of work. So we are taking a very strong measure on picketing, which I do not think that the country fully understands, and I wish to say now that the proposals on picketing would deal, and could deal, with a great deal of the secondary picketing that has been taking place in recent weeks. I must make that absolutely plain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Wishful thinking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that it is wishful thinking, and the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley has made his remarks. Do the Opposition say that they are satisfied with the law as it is at the moment, that they are not seeking any changes in industrial relations law? Are they really saying that, in the light of what the hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) himself said to the effect that if Lord Denning did not get the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0597">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>177</span>
law right, how could ordinary people get the law right? Does that suggest that the law is clear or framed so that people can understand it? Several Hon. Members 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me go on for a minute. I keep giving way. I shall give way in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe, and have always believed, that if we can get agreement between the parties to sensible changes in the law, that will be the greatest step forward that this country could ever take in industrial relations. That is what I have sought to do. I shall just quote from this week's issue of 	<i>The Economist:</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>"…it is now the logical duty of men of good sense in both the trade union movement and the Labour Party to say what sorts of restrictions on secondary strikes they would tolerate. If their answer is that all devolution of judgement in trade union affairs to new laws passed by parliament, and then to "men in wigs" is inadmissible, the gap between themselves and most middle-of-the-road opinion will become impossible. So will the government of the country."</p></blockquote>
I believe that we have an absolute duty to our country to try to reach the maximum amount of agreement between the two sides of the House but not to refrain from doing what we know to be right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to go for a moment before the hon. Gentleman intervenes, because I feel strongly about all this. I do not believe that most reasonable men, including trade unionists, and including active trade unionists take the view that the proposals that we have put forward so far, and the proposals that we shall put forward in a working paper, will do anything to take away the proper rights of trade unionists. What they will do is give greater protection to certain individuals and to certain groups of people, whether they be employers or employees, who feel that at the moment their views are not properly considered and that they are being asked, and forced, to take action against their will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have always said, we are dealing with delicate and difficult matters. The Government's proposals have not been formulated in the last few days. They arise out of the case of Express Newspapers v. MacShane. Let me say to the right hon. Gentleman that last winter the Attorney-General in his Goverment was suggesting
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
that people should use the law, but the law on immunities as it was last winter was the Denning judgment in Express Newspapers v. MacShane. That was swept away by the House of Lords, so the position now on immunities is—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Good hew, I have deliberately refrained from taking part in the Committee's proceedings so far in the interests of making progress, but as I understand it, we are discussing not the merits of a proposal that this Committee has yet to see, and which the right hon. Gentleman is arguing, but how the Government should proceed in this matter. I do not know whether the right hon. Gentleman has suddenly allowed himself to become obsessed with that light over the door and is seeking to make a party-political broadcast.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the right hon. Gentleman wants to debate these matters, we should be delighted to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This committee at this stage would be an inappropriate forum for the kind of debate that the right hon. Gentleman now appears to want to have, but if that is what he wishes we should be glad to participate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Question before the Committee is, That the debate be now adjourned. I had hoped that we could keep the discussion within fairly narrow limits. Even my small ingenuity could find many reasons for adjourning the debate if I were to set about such a task.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand rebuked by the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) and I would not wish to extend this debate a minute longer than necessary. I was trying to give what I hoped was some balance to the arguments that have been put this morning, and the arguments which the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) produced from the national newspapers. I was going on to say that the law is now in a mess but if, as we pointed out in 1974 we could have done, we had that Act as a basis of trade union and labour relations law, I believe that it would have stood the test of time, with a little tidying up. Unfortunately, that is not the law we have at the moment, and that is why the Government will be putting forward their proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that our proposals and the time that members of the Committee will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0598">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>179</span>
have to consider them in the light of the rest of the Bill, as they obviously want to do, together with the fact that I have given an undertaking about the timescale to consider the precise amendments that we shall put down, all shows that the Committee will have ample opportunity. Hon. Members will also have an opportunity for advice to be received from the trade union movement, the CBI and other interested parties. I want to make progress with the Committee. I recognise the strong feelings that the Opposition have on this particular subject. I hope that I have met many of the points that they have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the law has been clear ever since 1906. The learned and octogenarian Master of the Rolls gave a judgment, which almost every qualified commentator felt compelled to say was wrong. The house of Lords has put it right, and we all know what the law is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State tries to justify making profound changes in the law. We do not know what those changes are as yet. He intends to consult the TUC and the CBI, and we are very pleased to hear that. The procedural question I put to him is, should he not also consult the House of Commons itself, beyond this Committee? This is something really major, of far greater import than most of the things in the Bill—of such major importance that he even allowed himself to be carried away with some hyperbole about the interests of the nation and so on. Should not the House of Commons be consulted on a Second Reading basis, as well as the CBI?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman believes the law has been clear since 1906, he did not read what Donovan had to say. He did not read what his right hon. Friends have had to say in Committees on which I have sat over the past five years on trade union and labour relations Bills and employment protection Bills. The law has been anything but clear over the years. This is one of our problems. That is why I think it right to have consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the House of Commons not having a chance for consideration, the Committee has a chance for consideration. It would seem to me unlikely that these things will not be discussed on Report. I should have thought that there was ample
	<span class='label label-info column'>180</span>
opportunity. I am proceeding in a way which I should have thought met the convenience of the vast majority of those concerned both inside and outside this place. On that basis, I hope that we may make some progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I put a simple question. It concerns what the right hon. Gentleman said about the introduction of whatever fresh provisions he will bring along, new clause or whatever. He said that this would not affect anything we have done up to that point, as far as he can see. He said that there was nothing in clauses 1, 2, 3 and 4 which could conceivably be affected by what he might want to do about secondary picketing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does that not rule out the possibility of the Secretary of State's use of a code of practice rather than a statutory measure for some part or all of his intentions? Since clause 2 covers codes of practice, might it not be better if we did not complete the proceedings on clause 2 until we know what he intends? I put this to him in his own interest. He might want to use codes of practice for this purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is always ingenious, and he has shown his ingenuity once more this morning. If by any extraordinary chance one wished to deal with this matter by code of practice, the powers that we would have under clause 2 would enable that to be done. Therefore, I suggest that the right thing to do is to get on with clause 2, to discuss it sensibly and to talk about codes of practice. There will always be stages on a Bill, or perhaps on an Act, when the Secretary of State may, in years to come want to introduce codes of practice. The proposal in clause 2 helps rather than hinders anything that might be done. To that extent, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will allow clause 2 to go through comparatively quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that you will readily acknowledge, Mr. Good hew, that at no stage during the proceedings over the past three sittings have we deliberately wasted time in this Committee. It is not our desire to do so this morning. It may well be that we can pass over this motion and move on to clause stand part, but before we do that I wish to comment on what the Secretary of State has said. The right hon. Gentleman spoke with a good deal of passion
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0599">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>181</span>
during his remarks a few minutes ago. He is right to speak in such a way if that is how he feels. We all have a good deal of sympathy with him in the battle he now faces. This is perhaps the most traumatic period that the Secretary of State has had to face, not only during the past nine months or so of this Government but perhaps even more critical than anything he experienced when he was in government between 1970 and 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the feeling when there are colleagues within the Government who do not take on board precisely what the sponsoring Minister is trying to do. Inevitably pressures arise. That is, I am sure, the reason why the Secretary of State spoke as he did this morning. He did not tell us whether the Government had come to final views, and it is clear from what he says that the proposals which will be considered and issued in the next few days still have to be cleared by colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the reason for Secretary of State's concern. He will have his paper before the appropriate Committee. There will be one, no doubt, from the Prime Minister's own policy unit with another from CPRS or something of that sort, and it will be a real old ding-dodger when they meet, whenever it is they do, this week. While we wish that the Secretary of State were not involved in moving down this road, we can understand some of the difficulties and tensions he is experiencing, and that brings me to the point about how we should proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman says that nothing in the proposals will affect clauses 1, 2, 3 or 4. Naturally, we take his word for it, but we do not know completely about this and we shall not know until we see the proposals for ourselves. But it is clear that profound changes will be made to this Bill at some stage, and it is not right to slip them in at some stage during the Committee proceedings. As I have already said, I wish that we were not going down this road, but I think that the argument was summed up by my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) on Second Reading regarding the case of Express Newspapers v. MacShane. He said that this issued was being considered by the Government and that the amendments would be tabled at some stage. My right hon. Friend said that it really was not satisfactory for the Committee to have to consider these changes but that they should be considered by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
whole House. That is my view. I have not consulted my hon. Friends but certainly my view is that, if the Government are going down this path, it would be much better for the proposals to be considered in new legislation so that 635 Members of Parliament may have a view—it may well be that they will have a view—whereas now only 14 Members of Committee can consider them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will make their proposals in the next day or two and we shall see them. They will be considered by the TUC and the Confederation of British Industry. No doubt, whatever point we reach in Committee, we shall refer to them. But the Secretary of State said that, after those consultations, he would introduce amendments. I ask him now to consider the matter further. He will publish the proposals and lay them before the House, and they will be considered. I think that it would be much better if the Secretary of State decided, after consultation, to introduce a new Bill and took it through a separate Committee stage. We cannot come to a definitive view on that until we see the proposals but, hearing what the Secretary of State said this morning, I think that would probably be the best way to proceed. With that, if none of my hon. Friends wishes to take part further in this debate, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We return now to the Question, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I was speaking on Thursday on the motion that the clause stand part of the Bill, I said that one of our major anxieties, which is shared by the trade unions, is that if the State funding of ballots does not produce the results which the Government expect and if they fail to turn the unions into the tame tabby cats which the Prime Minister in particular would like to see, a Conservative Government will be tempted towards compulsory ballots. I do not think that our fears have been entirely allayed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned the Government's hopes in this matter. The Secretary of State quoted from the Donovan report earlier
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0600">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>183</span>
this morning. I should like to refer briefly to the Donovan report on this question of ballots, particularly strike ballots, by which the Government set a great deal of store. Paragraph 428 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is little justification in the available evidence for the view the workers are less likely to vote for strike action than their leaders; and findings from our workshop relations survey, already cited, confirm this. Experience in the USA has been that strike ballots are overwhelmingly likely to go in favour of strike action. This is also the experience of Canada, where strike ballots are compulsory in the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia."</p></blockquote>
The evidence is that the Government will not secure the results for which they are hoping. That is why we are worried that they will then be tempted to turn to tougher measures. If that is not so, I think that the Secretary of State must do much more than has so far been done to try to dispel such fears.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Needham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If what the hon. Gentleman said is true and ballots of this type go against the Government's intentions, the last thing that they will want to do is to introduce compulsory ballots because that would be against their interests. That proves that it would be much better not to have ballots at all. If all the evidence from the United States and Canada shows that they are likely to result in strikes, the last thing that the Government will want is compulsory ballots.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I am saying. This is a matter on which I fear that the Government have miscalculated, just as the Government in 1971 miscalculated. They have not paid sufficient attention to this kind of evidence, and I fear that in due course their miscalculations will catch up with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Ken Graham Assistant General Secretary of the TUC, referred to clause 1 in a speech in London on 24 January. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"By offering, in clause 1 of their Employment Bill, subsidies for ballots the Government think they are dangling a 'carrot' in front of the unions. But the trade union movement knows that the 18 clauses of the Bill are in fact a 'stick' to be used against workers, unions and sensible employers."</p></blockquote>
I add to that a comment on what the Secretary of State said about people of moderate views, including trade union
	<span class='label label-info column'>184</span>
leaders and activists, believing that this sort of legislation is good. If that is so, it is extraordinary that there is total unity on the TUC General Council against the Bill. Perhaps a few favour the odd clause—for example clause 1 but, generally speaking, there is unity of purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman should have watched "The World This Weekend" and heard those well known moderates, Mr. Jackson and Mr. Sirs, speaking about the Bill in very firm tones. I do not see how he can justify what he said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to pose a number of questions on clause 1. The first is on regulations and the proposed scheme. We have heard this morning that the Government can produce a consultative document on trade union immunities which they will bring to the Committee fairly speedily. We have been pressing for this since the beginning of the Committee stage. Why have we been unable to have a sight of the scheme for ballots, and some of the details for balloting? There would have been time to consult if the Government had had a will to do so. It is a sensitive and important matter of which we should have had more knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, at the very least, we shall have before Report a much clearer indication of the way in which the scheme for ballots will work. We should avoid leaving too much to the judges to decide as a consequence of the regulations. That could happen, and I shall illustrate that in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I should like to raise the question of money—the amount likely to be spent on ballots and State aid to the trade unions. I asked the Under-Secretary earlier if he could give an indication of his arithmetic. I asked how much he estimated that 1,000 postal votes would cost. He said that that was a matter with which we should deal on Report. I repeat my question because, although he mentioned the cash involved, he did not answer my specific question. I am trying to discover how the Government arrived at the £2 million figure. We know, because the Under-Secretary has told us, that that does not allow for inflation. It is not an inflation-proofed figure. It does not allow for the increases in postal charges introduced this week. The £2 million figure is therefore out of date. It would be interesting to the Committee to know how that figure is arrived at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A couple of our amendments have been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0601">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>185</span>
accepted in principle. It is not easy to work out, but the union policy-making body amendment—which the Government have accepted in principle—could cost the Government a considerable sum. Some of the policy-making bodies are very large indeed. Not all of them will elect their members by postal ballot, but when they do heavy additional costs will be incurred. On that basis alone, if there is to be the take-up that the government expect and want, £2 million will be inadequate. One could say that it will be grossly inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to raise another point with the Secretary of State. It arises out of our anxiety about the stringent approach that the Government are adopting to public expenditure. I am a little worried that in giving State aid to fund trade union ballots they may be giving something with one hand and taking it away with the other. The Department of Employment and the Department of Education and Science jointly give money to the TUC for education and training. In 1976/77 they gave £400,000 and the sum has risen steadily over the years to the nearly £1½ million estimated for 1979/80. I believe that the Government are still considering a TUC request for a modest increase for 1980/81. I would like to be assured by the Secretary of State that he will not offset those payments against the cost of balloting, and that they will not be reduced or scrapped—if not as a direct consequence of this, as an indirect consequence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can clear that up. The Government have told the TUC that they are increasing the grant available for training this year in line with the increase in the cost of living. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that I regard any money spent on training, particularly training and education for shop stewards and union officials, as a vital part of industrial relations. There is absolutely no question that we shall try to cheese-pare on this in order to raise money for ballots. I can give that undertaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that assurance. The whole Committee will be glad to know—or to suspect—that the Secretary of State has won a battle with some of his Cabinet colleageues who might not share his views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to put another question to the Secretary of State. The consultative
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
documents issued by the Secretary of State on such issues as picketing, the closed shop and ballots were due to appear in the Department of Employment Gazette. He will recall—and I have had this confirmed in a Parliamentary Answer by the Prime Minister—that the Prime Minister intervened on the eve of publication of the Gazette and publication was held up. It cost several thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money. Some people might think that that was rather extraordinary in view of the Prime Minister's concern about eliminating waste in public expenditure. She felt obliged to intervene and it must have caused the Secretary of State considerable embarrassment. It would be helpful to know what changes the Prime Minister felt it was necessary to make before the Gazette was finally published with the documents in it. Again we return to the doves and hawks argument, about which we have already heard a good deal this morning. Perhaps some of the changes which she sought to secure, and undoubtedly did secure, have affected the question of balance. It would be helpful if we could have some guidance on that at this stage rather than have to raise it again when we come to discuss picketing and the closed shop. It may be that the ballot question was not mentioned, but guidance would be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer again to Donovan. We have had some discussion about the benefits of workplace ballots as opposed to postal ballots, and Donovan has something useful to say about these matters. The report mentions on page 171 the advantages of postal balloting and says that this
	<br><blockquote><p>"has resulted in levels of participation significantly higher than those reached by unions when members vote at branch meetings, although a majority still abstain even in a postal ballot."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 636 goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In some unions many more members would vote if arrangements were made to enable them to do so at the workplace. This is done in the mines"—</p></blockquote>
we heard about that from my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley)—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and it results in levels of participation which are far higher than any reached in voting at branch offices…Nevertheless arrangements of this sort deserve to be encouraged, and provision for them could appropriately be made in factory agreements in future."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0602">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>187</span>
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is worth repeating that point because we have already heard in the Committee about the benefits of workplace ballots, and we would hope, therefore, that if the Government are going up this road they may feel able to include them in the assistance which they intend to give.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to clause 1(5). This has not been discussed by the Committee so far, and it concerns the question of which people are entitled to vote. The subsection says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and the scheme shall include provision for restricting the cases in which payments are made to cases in which the ballot is so conducted as to secure, so far as reasonably practicable, that those voting may do so in secret."</p></blockquote>
"Those voting"—who is entitled to vote in this sort of ballot? That seems to be vague phraseology. Who will decide? Will it be the certification officer? I shall say a word about his role in a moment, but if it is to be the certification officer where are the criteria to be laid down? Will that emerge in the scheme that we are told is to be drawn up? One can see here opportunities for those who wish to be difficult in this situation to take court action, and it is important that we should not again give a blank cheque.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me on to the certification officer. I want to know how it is thought that he will deal with a complaint of malpractice in these matters of ballots. It may be on the point of entitlement to vote or it may be on some other point concerned with elections. I turn again to the Donovan report, paragraphs 644–5. It talks about a satisfactory procedure requiring two elements:
	<br><blockquote><p>"provision for inquiry into the facts of an allegation of election malpractices, and provision for a trial."</p></blockquote>
Donovan's formula was that, in the first instance, the registrar, who I think would now roughly compare with the certification officer, should look at the situation. He should be able
	<br><blockquote><p>"to send an inspector equipped with the necessary powers to make a full inquiry into the facts in any case where a complaint appears to make this necessary."</p></blockquote>
Presumably, the certification officer would be in a similar position. He would be able to send one of his assistants,
	<span class='label label-info column'>188</span>
whether called an inspector or not, to make an investigation in the first place. According to Donovan, the registrar might
	<br><blockquote><p>"be able to obtain a satisfactory settlement on a voluntary basis."</p></blockquote>
But, if not, Donovan proposed an independent review body, really to avoid the courts. What we do not know is whether the Government have anything of this kind in mind or have considered these proposals in Donovan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen if the certification officer faces an allegation of malpractice in the conduct of a ballot? Will he have the last word? Presumably, he will, but this is the sort of thing that we have not had clarified for us in the Committee, and that is not a satisfactory way to proceed. It would be helpful if we could have some indication of what is in the Government's mind, whether they have thought of a review body, or whether they thought of it and ruled it out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These proposals for State aid for balloting, because they do not put the spotlight on the ballot procedures, will probably give rise to a rash of complaints for that very reason, because people will be much more aware of the balloting procedures. Indeed, the Government want that to happen. They want people to be more aware—we appreciate that—but as a consequence there may be more complaints than would otherwise be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The less detail we have in the Committee, the more we are bound to be concerned about the role of the certification officer, his scope and his powers. On the face of it, it seems that he has something of a blank cheque, that he will have a great deal of scope and opportunity for what one might call personal initiative. That is why I think it is unsatisfactory that we have not had more detail in our debates so far about the role of the certification officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are given no indication of the kind of requirements that the certification officer will apply to unions seeking money. Indeed, the Under-Secretary at one stage made up one condition out of the top of his head, one could say. When we were discussing the question of the principal management body, he first of all said that it would be a matter for the certification officer, and then in almost the same breath he said that it would be the executive body. Then we had a debate, and now we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0603">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>189</span>
have the prospect that the Government will accept in principle an amendment on that. So clearly there is confusion about the role of the certification officer and the guidelines under which he will operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that the Secretary of State will say that all this will be sorted out, but it is not satisfactory for the Committee to debate these matters at this stage without far more information about the details of the scheme. I hope that we shall hear something on that from the Secretary of State this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see little point in objecting to State aid of this kind where a union both needs and wants it—where, in other words, it is asking for it. However, I remain intensely sceptical—I think that this is the position of most of my hon. Friends—about the clause as drafted. We want far more explanation. We want a full and frank explanation of how the whole scheme will operate. I shall listen with care to what the Secretary of State has to say, but I shall take a lot more convincing that the Government have really thought through all the practical difficulties and all the complexities before I shall feel able to support the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, wish to draw the Committee's attention to some of the potential pitfalls that I see in the role of the certification officer, but before I do so I wish to refer briefly to the comments that have been made regarding the idea of secret ballots to produce the right result. I am sure that the whole Committee has the idea that secret ballots are intended not to produce the "right" result but to produce the result that the majority want to see reflected. That is the most important thing. I have had people writing to me recently claiming that they had not had an opportunity in strikes to see that their views have been accurately represented before they went on strike.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me turn back to the problems of pitfalls that I see in the role of the certification officer. I draw the attention of the Committee, and particularly of the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary, to the provisions of clause 1(3)(	<i>a</i>), which refers to the purpose of
	<br><blockquote><p>"obtaining a decision or ascertaining the views of members of a trade union"</p></blockquote>
on a strike, and with it consequential obligation on the certification officer to monitor the necessary finances involved
	<span class='label label-info column'>190</span>
in such an action. We must consider that not only is £2 million involved—perhaps even more than £2 million—but also that the certification officer's role has been considerably expanded over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must remember that the Trade Union Act 1913, the Trade Disputes Act 1965 and again the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 took the job of the chief registrar of friendly societies and transmuted it into that of the certification officer. In particular, that role was re-emphasised in the Employment Protection Act 1975, section 9, requiring that the certification officer should take custody of all the annual returns and accounts of the various trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have the depth of industrial experience and knowledge of my hon. Friends, but I have served for four years on the shop floor. I have, in the words of the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton), obtained the obligatory dirt under the fingernails. I know what it is like to use industrial machines such as lathes, capstans and the like. My fingers and hands bear mute testimony to the fact that they have had several unsuccessful confrontations with whirling pieces of machinery. I know, also, the tedium and boredom of doing routine mechanical assembly work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask members of the Committee to remember what happens when there is the possibility of a strike, the tension and the emotion that come in and—dare I say it—a little of the excitement. I ask them to bear in mind the pressures that are then put on the union in forming its strike committee, in getting the pickets under way and, of necessity, controlling the various finances involved in running such a strike operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is where my concern arises, because the certification officer has to control the money that goes into the operation of these ballots, and the strike committee has the job of controlling and monitoring the finances, the receipts and expenditures that occur. One appreciates that this is an extremely difficult task. It is hard enough to control the finances in an ordinary company day by day without trying to do it with the drama and excitement that arise when a strike is in progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an example, we have seen only too recently the problems that have been faced by one union, APEX, in handling the report of the Grunwick strike com-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0604">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>191</span>
mittee where some £26,000 is unaccounted for and could not be monitored. I know that the union has taken rigorous steps to try to find out where this sum has gone. The general treasurer has expressed in a report his extreme concern at what has occurred and has commented that the strike committee has been a law unto itself. In interviews he has said that he has tried to establish where the money has gone but has found that he has been inadvertently misled almost to the point of deception.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not suggesting that this goes on all the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a moment. My concern is that we have a certification officer handling public money who will be working almost alongside the problems of controlling the finance. It is the interface between public funds and union funds in a difficult situation—and a strike is dramatic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

Today a writ has been issued against the 	<i>News of the World</i> for publishing that report. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not give credence to these stories that no one knows where the money has gone. A statement was issued by the general secretary of APEX yesterday, and I can let the hon. Gentleman have a copy. This report has been completely denied. It is now an issue before the courts, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not spread such rumours until he is in full possession of the facts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for what he says. I have no wish to expand on this, and I have been using it as an example. It is an illustration of the difficulties. If the press are wrong on this particular issue, then I am delighted to hear it. However, I regret that this may not be so. I do not wish to get involved in this particular issue. It would be wrong because that would be
	<span class='label label-info column'>192</span>
turning away from the problems that I see facing the certification officer. A union has greater flexibility with its funds and how it can spend its money, whereas the certification officer is, of necessity, far more tightly accountable and acts within strict limits. I have pointed out the potential pitfalls, and I hope to achieve my end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that these exchanges show that when one goes too wide of the clause under discussion and becomes involved in individual cases there is likely to be trouble and delay.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I have been informed by APEX that a writ has now been issued. The story has been denied, and the matter is now, I assume, before the courts. This matter is now sub judice, and action has been taken to discredit all the lies that have been published. There is no evidence at all. We should not discuss this matter until the court case is heard. The spurious stories that have appeared in the press have been discredited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. May I draw your attention, Mr. Goodhew, to the reports of a cover-up which has been carried out for the best part of 12 months, allegations of a burglary and of records being stolen. It is wrong that the Committee should not be able to hear and discuss the problems of the certfication officer in trying to keep abreast with what is happening. Such a situation stifles discussion in a way which reminds one of the Watergate scandal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a bit funny and a bit silly that the Conservative Party is so obsessed by, and attaches so much undeserved importance to, the question of ballots. What is merely a piece of practical mechanics, sometimes useful and sometimes not, is made into a great issue of principle. The reason the Government have got that wrong is the same reason that they get so much else industrial relations wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Their picture of British working men is that they are a bunch of half-witted suckers, who can be led astray by any loudmouthed agitator who comes along. It is no use the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South-West (Mr. Page) shaking his head at that, because the only thing he will achieve by that is to shake it off. One hears and reads over and over again that good honest British working men, who have no desire other than to be sweet to their employers and get on with their jobs, are duped by agitators. The hon. Gentleman has just told us that he has worked in factories, so he must know some working men at first sight. Of course, not all of his colleagues know any working men—very few of them do. The hon. Gentleman must know that that picture is nothing like the truth at all. British workers vary. There are some good ones and some not so good, just as there are some good Members of Parliament and some not so good. By and large, they are sensible chaps who know their interests, they know the facts on both sides of an argument. They are pretty good hands at making a judgment as to which is the better side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>194</span>
I wish that people would stop talking about being duped by a handful of agitators. British working men are not chumps. The sooner the Tory Party stops talking as though they were, the better we shall all understand this issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not go to the stake on the question of ballots one way or other. No principle is involved. In some circumstances a ballot can be helpful. In occasional circumstances a ballot is virtually or actually essential. But a ballot is not a magic wand. Too many Tory Ministers and too many people in industrial management have started to think of it as a magic wand. They believe that all one needs to do is to make all trade union decisions by ballot and there will be no more industrial relations problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jocelyn Cadbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that it is right that people should be able to express their views in secret, as they do when they vote in an election. It is a matter of moral principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know why the hon. Gentleman thinks that it is necessary to help his hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire South-West by explaining what his hon. Friend was trying to say. I would have thought that the hon. Member was perfectly capable of making clear what he wanted to say without adventitious, and I suspect undesired, assistance. The hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South-West probably listened just now to his hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Cadbury) thinking that with hon. Friends like that who on earth needs honourable enemies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people who regard the ballot as the solution for all industrial ills. It does not always produce the results that its protagonists want, as is made clear in the quotation from Donovan mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington Central (Mr. Grant), and is abundantly clear to lots of people who have organised or taken part in ballots in trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are circumstances in which ballots are advantageous, so long as we remember that against those advantages one has to set three disadvantages. There is very little in life which is all black or all white, and there are very few choices we make where all the arguments are on one side and there are all advantages and no disadvantages. So it is with ballots. There are some advantages and there are three
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0606">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>195</span>
notable disadvantages. Ballots have the advantage that they are secret. That is fine. They have the disadvantage—I am seeking to put this in the most non-contentious way I can because it is a point of importance which must be taken on board by everybody interested in industrial relations—that votes are cast in a less well informed way than by almost any other means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A chap goes to his branch meeting and hears Joe Bloggs get up and say "I believe we ought to take industrial action over this for the following reasons…" Bill Snooks says "I think Joe is wrong and we ought to be opposed to industrial action for the following reasons. …" The chap who has gone along and heard them and asked Joe Bloggs and Bill Snooks questions about their views will cast a much better-informed vote than the chap—this is the one that hon. Gentlemen opposite seem to care most about—who will not get out of his telly armchair one evening a month to go to his branch or will not even go during the crisis of an imminent industrial dispute. What hon. Members are pleading for is decision by the uninformed. I do not say that that should be the final or only operative consideration, but it is something which we all need to take into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Needham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the evidence put forward at a great mass meeting is always totally unbiased evidence and gives as reasonable and sensible a view of the company's position as that which the company can itself give by putting it to the worker in his own home? I understand the view that that also may be biased, but surely one method is just as biased as the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I no not recall having said that people would be making statements which were not biased. On the contrary, I quoted two people as taking two opposiste points of view, and undoubtedly they could both be biased. I think that the hon. Gentleman is getting a bit near talking about ballots being conducted by employers rather than by trade unions. There is nothing about that in the clause, and I shall not follow him on that because we should rapidly all be out of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the decision would be an informed decision if the man had information from the
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
employer? The place for a trade unionist to get his information is at his branch meeting. I have been to more branch meetings than I have hairs on my head, I have heard many arguments, and, of course, there is a lot of bias in trade union arguments. There is a lot of bias in the arguments in a Standing Committee, but at least one gets the ebb and flow, the thrust and counter-thrust of argument, and people can make up their minds between the various elements of bias.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me take an example not of a ballot about a strike but a ballot to choose people. I think pretty well every trade union has the procedure that at each of its annual or biennial conferences a conference arrangements committee is elected to arrange the next conference, to order the agenda and so on. That is done by the delegates at the meeting. They know the blokes they are voting for. They have seen them at conference, they have heard them speak at conference, they know what their views are about how the business ought to be conducted. They are capable of making an informed judgment between Tom and Dick and Harry according to the contributions they make. They see them, they know them, they know their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How would one elect a conference arrangements committee by postal ballot of people the majority of whom have never been to a conference? Of course, one could do it—it is nice and secret and all the rest of it—but on what basis do those fellows vote?—on the basis of what they read in the newspapers. I said earlier in our proceedings, and I repeat, that one of the worst things that has happened in industrial relations in recent years is the increasing influence of the media on policy making and on the election of officials in trade unions.

We have heard a lot of chit-chat about the newspapers between the Secretary of State and my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) between my hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher) and the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South-West (Mr. Page). In all friendliness, I advise all the younger members of the Committee that I have managed to retain my pristine freshness and youthful ebullience in my present advanced age only by not reading newspapers. It is the best recipe that I know for a long, active and intelligent life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>197</span>
I read daily the two pages of one newspaper which describe what goes on in sport. The only part of those two pages which I accept without confirmatory independent evidence is the football scores. I do not believe another word of any of them. The reason that we have such a high incidence of vocational disease, mental and physical, in this place, is that all hon. Members spend to much of their time and energy on newspapers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been a very bad thing for industrial relations that in recent years the media have played an undue part in the work of trade unions. That is the first of the three disadvantages of the ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second is that it creates a lack of flexibility. The Secretary of State said in an earlier discussion that the things we are talking about are—I quote his words—"delicate and difficult matters". He is absolutely right. When things are delicate and difficult, the one thing that one most wants in dealing with them is the opportunity for flexiblity. Outside war, there is scarcely a field of human activity in which it is possible for things to change so quickly as in industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trouble with the ballot is that, once the ballot papers have been sent out, no matter how much atmosphere and attitudes change in the next 24, 48, or 72 hours, no initiative can be taken until those papers have been counted. One is frozen, sterilised and emasculated during the period of the ballot. That is not a good thing in industrial relations. One needs flexibility more than anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third disadvantage, which is connected with the one which I have just been talking about, is that of delay. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) quoted from the Donovan report what it described as the golden rule of industrial law. There is also a golden rule of industrial relations. It is that it is not the soft answer but the quick answer which turneth away wrath. Nothing contributes so much to the exacerbation of incipiently difficult relations between employer and employee as having to hang around for the answer to a question. Anything which causes delay in industrial relations is very much to be avoided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The worst feature about this delay is not merely delay in authorising the taking of industrial action but delay in stopping it once it has been taken. If one insists on a ballot before one starts a strike or other industrial action, one must have a ballot
	<span class='label label-info column'>198</span>
to stop it. If the executive of the trade union has given up its right to propose, then it has lost its right to dispose. If it has given up its right to decide—perhaps for very good reasons of which the hon. Gentleman would approve—whether industrial action should be taken, and what industrial action should be taken, it has given up its right to stop such action. There must be another ballot for that. So there is a lack of flexibility; there is oversimplification. I have never yet come across a ballot form which spelt out all the issues on both sides of the argument properly. That is a difficult thing to do, as any of the professional pollsters will agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said before, and I say again in this debate, that I do not believe that the clause will have any effect whatever. I do not believe there will be any more ballots or any fewer ballots as a result of its being passed. I do not know of one occasion—I am sure if the Under-Secretary does he will be kind enough to tell us—when a union executive said "Shall we have a ballot about this dispute?", some said "Yes" and some said "No", and somebody said "I think it would be a good idea but it will cost 25 thousand quid", so everybody said "Then we will not have it". I do not know of any case where a ballot which would otherwise have been taken was not taken because of the expense involved. Do any hon. Members know of such a case? I very much doubt it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that, after the Bill is enacted, when a union executive wonders whether or not to have a ballot somebody will say "Well, maybe it is not a very good idea but the Government are paying so let us do it." It will not happen that way. All the ballots that take place now will go on taking place. The members of my union will be a bit better off and more funds will be available for other purposes, perhaps including strike pay or one or two other things that hon. Members opposite might not approve of. There will not be any more ballots as a result of this legislation, and the Government know it. So why are they going ahead with it? What are they up to?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is really the answer to an earlier intervention by the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham) when he drew attention to the logic of this situation. He was quite right in what he said. The truth is that the Government's attitude on this question is not based on logic
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0608">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>199</span>
at all. It is an atavistic, instinctive reaction. To them, ballots are not merely a magic wand, they are a sort of virility symbol. They are legislating for ballots to show their political virility. But I repeat that nothing will happen as a result. Nothing is more painful and more pointless than a manifestation of virility which is frustrated by complete contraception. That is all that will happen as a result of this clause. I beg that we lose no sleep over it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to follow the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo). He spoke at some length, but he gave the game away in some of his opening remarks when he said that ballots would give undeserved importance to the views of people who might be asked to take part in a strike.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing clause 1, which deals with secret ballots, and one can see at once how relevant it is to the one event of supreme importance which is occurring in this country today, namely, the steel strike. The objective of clause 1(3)(	<i>a</i>) is to allow a ballot for the purpose
	<br><blockquote><p>"of ascertaining the views of members of a trade union as to the calling or ending of a strike."</p></blockquote>
What could be more relevant than that? The question I wish to ask, and I dare say the hon. Gentleman will be keen to answer, is: what is the attitude of the Labour Party in these circumstances?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is reason to believe that the thousands of steel workers in the private sector at present called out by their trade unions have very little desire to come out on strike. They would very much like to remain working but, because of their loyalty to their trade union or fear of picket lines or whatever, they feel constrained to come out on strike. I believe that it would be right for them to be given the opportunity to express their views in a secret ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My question—I look forward to hearing the answer—is what would be the attitude of the Labour Party? Would the Labour Party object to the trade unions involved holding a ballot among the workers in the private steel companies to find out from them and—to use the phrase of the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow—to give undeserved importance to the views
	<span class='label label-info column'>200</span>
of those who have been asked to come out on strike, to find out from them whether they really wish to strike?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Goodhew. In the short time he has been speaking, the hon. Member has twice quoted me as saying something which I did not say. I did not say anything like it. It will be on the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman gives what he thinks is the Labour Party's position in relation to ballots. If he had been listening to our debates on amendments to clause 1, he would recognise that over and over again my hon. and right hon. Friends have made it perfectly clear that the labour Party is in favour of ballots. I have cited my own trade union, the AEUW, which has ballots on everything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make this point to the hon. Gentleman, since he is concentrating on a dispute which is going on at the moment. If he does not appreciate it, the Secretary of State certainly does. There are industrial disputes going on and they always will go on in this country every day of the week, in plants and establishments all over the country. One of the things which he had better avoid and which the Secretary of State will have to take cognizance of, is the question of ballots to end strikes. If he had any knowledge of this subject at all the hon. Gentleman would recognise that that could be a very unfortunate weapon which the Secretary of State would be placing in not quite such responsible hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the things one always appreciates when one is involved in industrial disputes is that it is sometimes difficult to persuade the men to go back to work. If one always insists on secret ballots, strikes will go on a lot longer than they do at present and until such time as the men on strike have won their total demands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear the point that the hon. Gentleman makes. My point is that the opportunity should be given to those workers in the private sector of the steel industry to express their view, quietly and calmly, after due reflection and after due consideration of the views of their union, if the executive of their union wishes them to strike, and the views of anybody else who wishes to make representations to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0609">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>201</span>
them, together with the views which come from their own common sense and experience of their own industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise to the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow if I misquoted him, but I took the trouble to write down what I thought he had said, which was that there was a danger of attaching undeserved importance to the views of the people involved. If I have misquoted, I am happy to hear it and I am happy to have his support that we should attach due importance to the views of the people involved, because that is exactly the object of this part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One is provoked to say a few words by the rhetorical questions of the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Lyell). May I say how pleased we are to see the Secretary of State with us today. We understand completely that he has been involved in higher forums, and I am certain that he will be happy to know that in his absence the Under-Secretary of State has been at his most persuasive—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend must speak for himself. I think "bland" would be better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No—at his most disarming. He has presented the whole of clause 1 as very beneficent. I thought at one time that he was perhaps desirous of a gold badge of merit for service to the trade union movement for bringing these gifts to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State says that that will come. In the circumstances, it must seem churlish for someone like me, a suspicious sort of person, to look at all askance at what is being done. But the more I have thought about it and the more we have probed, the less satisfactory the whole thing becomes and the more critical one becomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been pointed out, there is a wide variety of procedures within trade unions for conducting ballots. Indeed, there are as many procedures as there are unions. Some union rules do not permit postal ballots. Therefore, it is nonsense to insist on one universal method, yet that is really the Government's present intention. They say "postal ballot". That has been made clear. They seem to be enamoured of
	<span class='label label-info column'>202</span>
pillar-box democracy. They seem to think that that is superior to any other form. We have suggested that it should be "postal or other".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have explained how my union arranges ballots at the workplace, and I shall not go into that again, in the interests of brevity. I have said that it is similar to the way we hold general elections. We have discussed the way the NUM does things with pithead ballots. I think that when the AUEW had a postal ballot the response was about 30 per cent. to 35 per cent. Yet when the NUM does it a different way, with a pithead ballot, which would not qualify for funds under the present system, it gets a turnout of at least 70 per cent. So it is quite often possible to get a higher turnout with a workplace ballot than with the pillar-box procedure. I just draw that to the Minister's attention. If he wants a higher turnout, he should take cognisance of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next I look at the cost. We have asked how the figure of £2 million is arrived at. It is completely unexplained to me. We now know that the cost of posting a first-class letter is to rise to 14p. Let us compromise and call it 13p. The letter has to come back, and that makes it 26p. To make it a round figure, let us say 25p to send a letter out and a letter back. That means that, for four members to cast a vote costs £1. In addition, there are the envelopes, the printing of the ballot papers, the explanatory literature, the election addresses and the extra staff involved. I suggest that the cost would come to about £1 for every two members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How many trade union members are there. The total is about 12 million, so, if every trade unionist under this new scheme voted once, that would cost £6 million. I am assuming that we want democracy throughout the trade union movement, that we want regular postal balloting. So it will obviously cost much more than £6 million. I am sure that hon. Members who are so enamoured of postal balloting will want many ballots. I think that a more realistic figure would be something like £15 million. That is the sort of figure I have worked out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, let us take some of the printing unions that already hold postal ballots, which are compulsory. There are three envelopes. One envelope goes out. Inside it there are two other envelopes, on one of which the member puts his branch number. He puts a plain envelope
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0610">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>203</span>
inside. When the envelopes come back, the branch number is checked off and those envelopes are destroyed. Then the votes are counted, and those members who did not vote are fined. The work is done with the assistance of the Electoral Reform Society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have here the actual ballot papers of my own union, NATSOPA, which presumably would be eligible for these funds. I do not know whether hon. Members understand how we do things. The first paper is for the election of the president, which is by a secret postal ballot. The president is a lay member, and therefore not an employee of the union. Therefore, unless the Government change their clause, his election would not qualify. What happened on this occasion was that, because the candidate with the highest number of votes did not have a majority of all the votes, we had to have a second ballot. So, for the president there were two ballots.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact that the president of my hon. Friend's union is a lay member does not mean that he will be ruled out. He will be included within clause 1(3)(	<i>b</i>), because he will be a member of a committee of management.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is reassuring. I thank my hon. Friend for the information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would also point out that we send out biographical notes on all the candidates. That costs a great deal of money. In addition, our delegates to the Trades Union Congress and to the London Labour Party are all elected by secret ballot. Then we have the London machine branch members voting for the governing council. That is another sheet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member seems to have rather a wad of papers. If he wants to establish the cost of this particular ballot, could he do a quick totting up on his pocket calculator, or on his fingers, whilst the Committee gets on with its work, and come back with a total?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am suggesting, Mr. Goodhew, that, whether stamps cost 12p 14p or whatever, the material will be so heavy that it will probably cost a lot more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because each branch elects members to the local Labour Party, the local trades council and so on, we have to print differ-
	<span class='label label-info column'>204</span>
ent ballot papers for each region. Unless hon. Members would like to know how we run the union, I shall compress this matter. There are at least 13 different districts for which different lots of ballot papers have to be printed. That is extremely expensive. All our wage offers have to be put to ballot. There are the changes of rules, which are extremely complicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figure of £2 million—if the Minister is serious—is completely unrealistic. That makes me slightly suspicious. I wonder whether this is what the Government intend to spend the £2 million on, or whether they have something else in mind. No doubt that is the intention of the present Ministers. But let us suppose that there were different, rather more extreme, Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the Prime Minister said on television—I have heard echoes of it here today—that in the case of an industrial dispute there would be a referendum, or a vote would be called for, not a ballot in agreement with the union but perhaps held by the company. The Under-Secretary has explained that this is optional and that only if the trade unions ask for it will it be done. The Bill does not say that anywhere. It merely provides that the Secretary of State
	<br><blockquote><p>"may by regulations make a scheme".</p></blockquote>
It does not say that he may do so with the agreement of the unions. We have looked askance at clause 1(3):
	<br><blockquote><p>"and such other purposes as the Secretary of State may by order specify."</p></blockquote>
That is a stark form of words. It could be improved by the insertion after "order" of the words "after consultation with the trade unions".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary said that line 15 was permissive. We have all heard of the permissive society, where anything seems to go. He was challenged by my hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Evans), who asked if he could think of any other purpose for which this could be used. He immediately replied that he had had a suggestion from the CBI. The CBI might suggest all sorts of things. We want it written into the Bill that it should be done only after consultation with the unions. If the Government want the unions to do everything democratically and by secret postal ballot, they should set an example. The CBI, for example, at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0611">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>205</span>
its annual conference voted in favour of secret postal ballots by a show of hands. Just down the Corridor in this House is another body which is hardly elected by postal ballot. We have in this place a Cabinet—a Committee of management—which is a sort of closed shop. That is not elected by postal ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the chairmen of companies, such as Michael Edwardes? Was he elected by postal ballot? On all these matters, if the Government were to set an example to the trade unions that would be much better than preaching and coercion by law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that many hon. Members would like to get this clause on its way before one o'clock. Therefore, it may be convenient if I intervene at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little disappointed by the recap-tion the Opposition have given to the clause. I thought that they would embrace it and welcome it. I am grateful to them for some of their comments about it. We shall take these comments into consider-ation when we come to the framing of the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe, as I think my hon. Friends do, that the importance of a secret ballot is not so much that it may give one result or another as that it gives everyone an opportunity to cast a vote in secret. When I heard some of the arguments of the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo), I thought of the House of Lords debates on the many Reform Bills of the 1880s and around that time. I think that it was Lord Palmerston who said that he considered ballots an insult to the dignity of an Englishman. I would hate to think that the hon. Gentleman was a latter-day Palmerston, but in view of the remarks he has made about the use of the secret ballot, I think he may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Learned Gentleman went on to say that he had never known of a case in which trade unionists had decided not to have a secret ballot on grounds of cost. His memory is not very long in this respect not as long as it usually is. That was the main reason why the Left-wingers at the rules revision conference of the AUEW in 1975 sought to turn it out. It was only defeated by 27 votes to 25. I think that cost is an element.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make abundantly clear that we are seeking to make funds available in the simplest possible manner, so that
	<span class='label label-info column'>206</span>
unions can, if they so desire, take advantage of them. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Lyell). If only we could get this established so that at least the employees in the private sector of the steel industry, for example, could feel that they had a chance to hold a secret ballot before they were forced out on strike, I think that the whole country could see that there had been a secret ballot, a decision had been made, and would consider that fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to give some aid towards that sort of case. It will not always work. It will not always go the way many people think. It is not a panacea for our problems, and we know that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State is putting an extremely important point in using the example of allowing the steel workers in the private sector to hold a secret ballot on whether they want to come out on strike. No one disagrees with the argument that he is deploying at the moment, but would this clause allow the Secretary of State to force through a ballot of those workers if the trade union, the ISTC, did not want to hold that ballot?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, it would not. Under no circumstances would it. But I should have thought that the ISTC, knowing that it would not have to use its own funds for this purpose, and the union members knowing that they would not have to use union funds for this purpose, might well be encouraged to hold secret ballots. It will not always happen, and it will not happen overnight. The more it happens, the better it will be. We shall then see that there is true democracy within the trade union movement. Regrettably, I do not believe that anybody could say that that situation exists today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been asked about cost. Quite frankly—I say this to the Committee without fear of contradiction from the Chancellor of the Exchequer or anybody else—if we have underestimated the cost no one will be more pleased than the present Government. The more money that is spent, the more secret ballots will have been held.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Including the Chief Secretary to the Treasury?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Including the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. I think we shall all
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0612">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>207</span>
be pleased, and I hope that we can be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to some of the points raised by the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant), in particular. He referred to clause 1(5) and asked who was entitled to vote. The answer is: in elections, all those entitled under the rules; for strikes, all those likely to be instructed by the union or advised to participate. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the fact that the 	<i>Department of Employment Gazette</i> had had to be altered. There were changes in the working document. Perhaps the printing began a little too early. It actually refers to what we were saying about recognition and has nothing to do with this issue at all. I should like to make that plain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked also about regulations. The scheme has not yet been drawn up. Obviously, we have to await the views of the Committee and the House. We should be showing scant respect to what I regard as the most important forum of the nation, that is, Parliament—more and more I hope that we shall get some authority and power back to Parliament and not allow it to escape down the road to other places—if I had regulations already prepared before I had heard what the Committee had to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was arguing that we should have seen something in draft form, not that the right hon. Gentleman should have come along with a cut-and-dried scheme at this stage. I appreciate that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give an absolute undertaking, but I shall see whether it is possible to have something in draft form before Report so that hon. Gentlemen can have a look at it. I cannot promise that, but we shall certainly undertake to try to have something ready in draft form by that time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the context of what he has just said, could the Secretary of State see that the two questions which I asked are covered? First, who will decide the questions to be asked in the ballot? One is rather worried that sometimes tendentious questions can be asked, and one would like to know whether the certification officer will have to bear that in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, what will be the position if a
	<span class='label label-info column'>208</span>
trade union flouts the result of a ballot? The hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) said that it is sometimes difficult to make men go back to work at the end of a strike. If a ballot has found that people should go back and they do not, will the certification officer then not allow the funds to be made available?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would put the certification officer in an impossible position. He is there merely to take cognisance of the fact that an orderly ballot has been held. He cannot be responsible in any way for the result of the ballot or what happens after the ballot. Nor can the certification officer be responsible for the way that the question is framed. That is not a matter for him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are important matters, but again we have to be very careful. If it is thought for one moment that the Government are involving themselves, through the certification officer or through anyone else, in the actual form that the ballot takes, this will destroy the whole purpose of trying to get more ballots. I have much greater faith than that in the good sense of the average trade union official and the average trade unionist. We must just leave it to them to get on with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the Secretary of State has just said in response to his hon. Friend the member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) is most important and will determine the attitude not only of the Committee but of many trade unions if the Bill reaches the statute book. Is he giving a categoric assurance that the result of the Government's providing public funds for a ballot will in no way impinge on the autonomy of the trade unions in conducting the ballot?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. I can give that categoric assurance. In simple terms, the certification officer will have to satisfy himself that the expenditure was properly made and in secret ballot upon an eligible issue, and that every member had, so far as is possible, a fair opportunity of voting. Those are the matters in which the certification officer will be interested. He cannot interest himself in the other matters which my hon. Friend feels so strongly about. I fully appreciate his point of view, but we do not believe that he is right. I hope, with those explanations, and having had a quick look at the time—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee, but one point that has been raised several times is the question whether the Secretary of State envisages that expenditure for the purposes laid down in the clause will go beyond the cost of postage and of printing the ballot forms—whether, for example, it will cover the cost of the kind of leaflet that British Leyland put out to its workers, and perhaps funds for the shop stewards to do something similar to inform their members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We feel that there should be a reasonable amount of additional expenditure for leaflets and so on, but the amount should be reasonable and not extravagant, such as perhaps the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) was suggesting.

Could I say one last word on workplace ballots? We would like to give every possible encouragement to the holding of ballots at the workplace. I do not regard this as necessarily the first step in regulations that we are drawing up. This is something which ought to go on as a matter of good industrial practice between employers and employees now.

I stress as strongly as I can that I hope that many more companies will make full use of the secret ballot at the place of work. I think that that is the most satisfactory way of increasing the number of people who take part in the affairs of their union, and the use of the postal ballot is perhaps a second best in this direction. Having said that, I agree that this is an important clause and I hope that the Committee will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask one brief question on clause 1(3)(	<i>a</i>), which I suspect is the heart of clause 1. It refers to "ascertaining the views of members of a trade union". Will the Secretary of State give a guarantee that that provision would not be used to allow the employers to hold a ballot of their individual workers, but that the ballot will always be in the hands of the trade union?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as this clause is concerned, and dealing with public money, there is no money available for anybody

other than a trade union. But this will not stop British Leyland, if it can agree with its unions, having a secret ballot at its workplace or by post which it pays for itself. This clause is only for money which is used by a trade union approved by the certification officer. The hon. Gentleman has put up more hares which have failed to run down the course than in any Committee stage I have ever known.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State think we should not raise hares in the Committee considering the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have an eye on the clock and there are a number of points which I should have liked to raise with the Secretary of State, although I think he has helped the Committee considerably this morning. I shall content myself with picking up one point only. He talked about the Left wing of the AUEW national committee using the argument of cost against secret ballots. If he looks at it, he will find that that was only one of a large number of arguments that they used. He has been around long enough to know that it is unlikely that that was the overriding factor.

We on the Opposition Benches retain our unease not about the principle—I think there is no question of arguing against this in principle—but about many of the practicalities. However, the Secretary of State has said—for instance on the matter of regulations—that he will do his best to come back to us before Report. He and his hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary have accepted a couple of our amendments in principle which again goes to show that the debate has been valuable, and in the light of that we do not intend to press the clause to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
