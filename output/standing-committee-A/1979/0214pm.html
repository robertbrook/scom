	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During our short debate this morning on the sittings motion, the Under-Secretary appeared to indicate that clauses 1 and 2 were of less significance than other parts of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Regarded by the Opposition as less significant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put the hon. and learned Gentleman's mind right in that respect? I know that I am expressing the view of my right hon. and hon. Friends when I say that we regard every clause of the Bill as being of significance and importance, and none more than clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it were possible to write codes of practice which would truly approve industrial relations in this country, that would be a major leap forward. In our debates on the amendments to clause 2 we have tried to assist the Government in that respect. I have read again the Secretary of State's words at our fourth sitting when we had a short debate on the motion to adjourn:
	<br><q><p>"I believe that we have an absolute duty to our country to try to reach the maximum amount of agreement between the two sides of the House …"</p></q>
No one could possibly disagree with those words, and it is in that spirit that we have tried to assist. But it is worth reading the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>368</span>
remainder of the sentence. The Secretary of State went on:
	<br><q><p>"but not to refrain from doing what we know to be right."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 5 February 1980; c. 177.]</p></q>
That is the contradiction in the sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One assumes, when one enters into consultation on highly important matters, that one goes in, if not with a completely open mind, with a willingness to listen to other parties' views on the subject under discussion. All the evidence from our debates points to the fact that the Government's mind is closed on this subject. They are determined not to listen in a serious manner to any other views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State said on Second Reading:
	<br><q><p>"Clause 2 contains the power to publish codes of practice for the improvement of industrial relations."</p></q>
If publishing codes of practice could have improved industrial relations, I have no doubt that my own Government from 1974 to 1979 would have published them at the rate of one or two a day. But it is not simply a question of publishing codes of practice. The Secretary of State went on:
	<br><q><p>"We need both the law and guidance on best practice, and codes will help achieve this"—</p></q>
But only, of course, if the codes which are produced have the agreement of the parties involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><q><p>"I intend to use this power to produce a code on the closed shop."</p></q>
I appreciate that we shall debate the closed shop in greater depth later: I am sure that Tory Members will benefit from what we are able to tell them about the reasons for the closed shop and how the trade union movement developed towards the closed shop. But I should be going a little out of order if I developed that theme too much now. The Secretary of State then went on:
	<br><q><p>"If no other authoritative, comprehensive and effective guidance is available, I shall produce a code on picketing."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 December 1979; Vol. 976, c. 61.]</p></q>
We all know that there is no such thing as any other authoritative, comprehensive and effective guidance on the closed shop. If there were, it would have been produced a long time ago. Again, we shall
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0701">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>369</span>
be driven back to the fact that the Secretary of State, presumably with the assistance of his hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary, will produce a code on picketing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary and the Secretary of State have been round the track before. Indeed, the hon. and learned Gentleman will recall our debates on the Employment Protection Bill, when one of my hon. Friends and I detained the Committee for some time in trying to produce a form of words acceptable to all sides in relation to picketing. I am sure that he will recall also that our own Government had to depend on the support of the hon. and learned Gentleman and the rest of his party to carry the day on the clause dealing with picketing. My right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) was the Minister of State and he well recalls our embarrassment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—during that period when Labour Members spent many hours attempting to get a point of view accepted which would have brought in a degree of common sense. We failed. We got no support whatsoever from the Tory Party on that occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We got no support, no amendments and no encouragement then from the Opposition, so it will be interesting now to see the codes of practice which will be produced in this area when during 1975 we had no assistance. The Under-Secretary will appreciate that I wait with bated breath for the Government's pronouncements on picketing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that the real argument is taking place not on either side of the Committee but within the Cabinet and within the Tory Party. I shall not comment on the attitude of the moderates in the Tory Party, but presumably one day they will rebel against the reactionary policies being inflicted on them at the moment. But the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Needham), in an intervention in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo), referred to the problems that the Labour Government faced last winter said:
	<br><q><p>"We might as well pay up and forget. There has to be some way out of this. Surely, it is right that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>370</span>
the Government should make such a suggestion—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A.</i> 12 February, 1980; c. 306.]</p></q>
That is the cry from the heart of the moderates within the Tory Party. I am giving the hon. Gentleman the benefit of the doubt in taking him to be a moderate. I have not heard many of his comments yet, but I shall give him that benefit at the moment. That is the cry: "Surely, something must be done in a very difficult situation".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That has been the thrust of our contribution, too, in the debate on clause 2. We recognise that the problems of British industry are deep-seated and far reaching. No one knows better that my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker), who was Minister of State in the Labour Government and has spent more years in the Department of Employment and dealing with employment matters both in Government and Opposition than any other Member of the House. He had to wrestle with the problems night and day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that it is necessary for all men of good will, particularly those with knowledge of the trade union movement, to assist in arguments in these areas. Whenever we have suggested that Parliament should have the right to assist with or amend codes of practice, it has been resolutely resisted. I do not know why the Ministers have resisted such arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman threw a sprat to his rather Right-wing colleague, the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst), when he said that he would consider the role of the Select Committee. We shall see whether the Select Committee will be treated seriously when codes of practice are drawn up. I do not know how the House of Commons would view the fact that a Select Committee was to be given greater rights than itself. There may be conflict between the Select Committee and the Secretary of State for Employment on a code of practice. That would lead to a fascinating situation. I shall not speculate on whether that may happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we could issue a code of practice for such vexed areas as picketing and the closed shop that had the agreement of the TUC, the CBI, the Government, the Opposition and the minority parties, it would be a significant document. I recognise that the Secretary of State and the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0702">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>371</span>
Parliamentary Secretary are reasonable men who would do their utmost to produce a reasonable document; the evidence is clear that that would not be acceptable to the Cabinet, particularly to the hawks within it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Prime Minister today answered a question from one of my hon. Friends who referred to the rather disgraceful speech made at the weekend by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Chancellor blatantly stepped outside the remit of his own Department and into the area of the Secretary of State at a very delicate moment. One can forgive a Cabinet Minister from time to time for straying unwittingly outside his own area, but that was obviously and significantly a blatant attempt by the Chancellor to circumvent the views of the Secretary of State for Employment at a very tricky moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One suspects that the code of practice that would be drawn up in either of those major areas would reflect the views of the hawks in the Cabinet. It would be presented to Parliament without Parliament having the right to amend it. Presumably, it would be railroaded through the House of Commons with its present majority and the Tory Moderates, as usual, would lie down and be ridden over. At the end of the day, we should have a code of practice, but it would not be worth the paper that it was written on. It would be obvious to the trade union movement and to the wider working class that the Labour Opposition were opposed to something of significance within that code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The shop stewards' movement, the convenors and those whom hon. Gentlemen opposite so often suggest are extremists in industrial relations, would take the view that if the Labour Opposition had made it clear that they did not accept the code of practice and that they would repeal, if not the whole code, then certain areas of it, it would hardly be surprising if those directly involved ignored it until that was done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Needham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, the question of codes of practice would be best dealt with on a voluntary basis. It would be best to make sure that the CBI, the TUC, the Government, the employers
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>372</span>
and the unions got together to produce a code of practice on picketing. It would be better to continue down the road of industrial relations on a voluntary basis. We know the difficulties that arise when statutes are introduced into industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the hon. Gentleman think a situation which the TUC and the CBI would agree on a code of practice on picketing? Is it sufficient for the code of practice, or the TUC guide produced last Year, to say that unions in general, save in exceptional circumstances, confine picketing to premises of the parties to the dispute, or the premises of suppliers and customers of those parties? That is so wide as to make the thing almost meaningless. That is why I suggest that the right way to proceed, unfortunately, is the way that we propose, however much we may wish not to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome that short speech from the hon. Gentleman. I hope that we shall have many more contributions from him. Unfortunately, he has missed my point, which was that Parliament should have the right to discuss the code of practice and if necessary amend it. If a code or practice produced by the Secretary of State for Employment is written and presented to Parliament and railroaded through because of the Tory Government's majority, it will not be worth the paper that it is written on. It would be far better for the Secretary of State to think again, even at this late hour, and give Parliament the right to amend the code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman would like me to give him chapter and verse on areas in which there has been co-operation and agreement, I shall be happy to do so, but I suspect that his Whip would not be happy at the end of it. I shall take the advantage of briefly mentioning the lorry drivers' strike last year, which was a very difficult dispute. A large section of my constituency is situated at the junction of the M6 and the M62 and there is a significant distribution network. Hon. Gentlemen should bear in mind that many of those involved in the lorry drivers' strike had little knowledge of industrial disputes. In many cases, it was the first involvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go into the background of that dispute. I hope that I shall have the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0703">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>373</span>
opportunity on a later clause. But when men involve themselves for the first time in their lives in an industrial dispute, they have to learn many things the hard way. I spent my life in the shipbuilding and ship repairing industry. We had what was probably the proudest and longest record of industrial strife of any industry in Great Britain. All our shop stewards and convenors—I was a convenor myself for five years—were experts at conducting strikes. We never embarked upon a strike unless we knew that we could win it within four days. We recognised that it was pointless going on strike unless we could win or if it would take a long time to win. Industrial expertise of that nature is built up over a considerable period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some very unfortunate things took place during the lorry drivers' strike which involved me as the Member of Parliament. But at the end of the day the two unions involved in the strike—the United Road Transport Union was involved as well as the Transport and General Workers Union—issued a code of practice. They instructed their members on the tactics they must adopt and the areas where they could allow groups of workers who had settled to return to work. The real problem was that those groups of workers had become involved in an industrial dispute for the first time, and they were learning the hard way. I am sure that if they were forced into another industrial dispute—and with this Government, that could happen at any time—the country would see that they have put to good effect the lessons they learnt the hard way in that dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are, therefore, plenty of examples of the TUC, the CBI or—much more relevantly groups of workers, including district officials, shop stewards and convenors entering into arrangements and negotiations. Whether in the context of a strike or of industrial action in some other form, such as a ban on overtime, groups of workers will enter into a dialogue with their employers. They do not need a Government code of practice. They have a great deal of practical knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who have had wide experience in this area could give the Government considerable assistance in drawing up their codes of practice, particularly on what seem to be the only areas about
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>374</span>
which there is concern—the closed shop and secondary picketing. I feel that the Government are missing a great opportunity here. I shall make the point as strongly as I can. If we could produce a code of practice which had the agreement of the TUC, the CBI, the Government and the Opposition, I believe that such a document would command tremendous respect and support outside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately—this is the tragedy of clause 2—we shall not get such a document, because the Government are not going to give us any opportunity to assist them. I suspect that the code of practice will take longer to draw up than many members of the Conservative Party seem to appreciate. Once the Government start writing the damned thing, they will realise that they are bound to run into very great difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that with our wide industrial knowledge we could have assisted them enormously, but they are not going to give us the opportunity. As one of my hon. Friends said in an earlier debate, they will present us with a code of practice containing the little bit of poison that will make the whole thing inoperative and ineffective, and we will then be faced with rejecting it in to to. That is not the best way to embark upon a Bill that is aimed, according to the Secretary of State, at improving industrial relations. If this attitude is to prevail as we go through the Bill, the Secretary of State can rest assured that all the Bill will do—and clause 2 is a very good example of where the offer of co-operation should have been seized—is make industrial relations a damned sight worse than they are now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If clause 2 remains part of the Bill, the Government will rue the day, just as the then Conservative Government regretted the day when the Industrial Relations Act was passed. In my view, it will lead to a worsening, not a bettering, of industrial relations. Clause 2 deals with a code of practice. That code will probably be drawn up in spite of evidence given by the trade unions that many parts of it are unacceptable to them— because, in the last analysis, it will be the Secretary of State who will decide what that code of practice will be. If one looks
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0704">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>375</span>
into the future, one can see how the code is likely to be used in the courts to penalise trade unionists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us imagine what might well happen in the future. During an industrial dispute, a picket or a striker might be arrested for a comparatively innocuous breach of the law, such as obstruction. He might be told by a police constable to get back onto the pavement, he might refuse, he might put out his tongue at the police constable, and he might be arrested and charged with obstruction. He would then come before the magistrates' court. He might well be able to bring evidence before the court to prove that the incidents with which he was charged had not happened. The magistrates might be evenly balanced as to whether they should acquit the man or convict and sentence him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prosecuting solicitor might then say "In addition to that offence, I have to report that this man is in breach of the code of practice." No one can be prosecuted for breaching a code of practice, but nevertheless the fact of the breach could be brought before the court as part of the evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the code of practice might state that the number of pickets must be limited to 10. The prosecuting solicitor would say that the man had been the eleventh picket in the line, that he had breached the code and that that should be taken into consideration when his offence was considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The man being prosecuted might well say in defence that he had thought he was one of the permitted 10 pickets, or that he took a place in the line of pickets because one of the pickets had gone away for lunch or to obey a call of nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would then be a long legal argument not about whether the man was guilty of obstruction but about whether he was guilty of disobeying the code of practice. We must face the problem of the code of practice being used as another weapon against the trade union movement and against individuals who, in the eyes of the law, have breached the code of practice and have breached the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trade union movement has managed perfectly well since 1906 with a picketing law that has remained practically unchanged. The only change that has been made is that it is no longer possible
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>376</span>
to picket outside an individual's house. Other than that, since 1906 there has been little change in the law on picketing. Yet we are now to have a code of practice which might well be used as a weapon in the courts to convict people not of disobeying the code of practice—the code will not carry legal sanctions—but on other charges, so that those people will be punished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government say that the Bill is intended to improve industrial relations. But this is the worst possible step to take. It will build up resentment and a confrontation with the trade union movement because, in the last analysis, it will bring the law into disrepute. In the last analysis, trade unionists will defy the law, just as they did under the Industrial Relations Act. The Government will then have to call on the Official Solicitor and try other means of extracting themselves from an impossible situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are only at the beginning of the Bill. Clause 2 is the first step on the road of trying to tie the trade union movement hand and foot with the red tape of law so that it cannot operate in a positive way to improve the terms and conditions of employment of its members. That is the purpose of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Wolfson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to the picketing law which has been unchanged since 1906. With all the changes in mobility, wealth and the opportunities nowadays for people to travel long distances in order to picket, does he suggest that no change at all is necessary now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I believe that no change is necessary now. Mobility had not been with us only in the last 12 months. We have had mobility—even if we take the motor car, for at least the past 20 or 30 years. There is no substance in saying that because people can get around the country more quickly we are facing problems that we did not have 20 or 30 years ago—although it may have been true 100 years ago. The law had not been changed. It worked perfectly well before hysteria was engendered by the press, and it can work well in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the last analysis, every Member will have to agree that in industrial conflict
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0705">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>377</span>
solutions can be found only by mutual agreement between employers and employees, The employer wants to get his labour as cheaply as possible; he wants to buy in the cheapest market as he buys any other commodity. On the other hand, workers want to protect themselves colectively to get the best possible terms and conditions of employment. That contradiction in attitudes can be resolved only by sitting round the table and arriving at a solution. Incidentally, in 98 or 99 per cent. of disagreements a solution is found with recourse to strike action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Intervention by the law and the Government—the steel strike is a remarkable example—leads to friction beween the two sides. Understanding cannot be reached and each side blames the other for the dispute. The media, being in the hands of people who believe that we live in the best of all possible worlds, obviously take the view that the fault always lies with the worker. That is not so.

We must be very careful with clause 2, because we are adding more red tape to the miles and miles of further red tape to be added as the Bill makes progress, and this will bedevil relationships between working people and their employers. I hope that we shall consider clause 2 very carefully before we incorporate it in the Bill, because we are going down a road which will only lead to greater difficulties in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said a couple of times that disputes can only be settled between employer and employee. We agree absolutely. The recommendations on picketing, for which these rules will particularly be laid down, are to ensure that picketing is peacefully conducted and confined to those in dispute at their own place of employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not been able to consider the new clauses so we do not know how far we shall go along the road that the hon. Gentleman mentions. We are only dealing with this particular part of clause 2, with the code of conduct, so the matter he raises is irrelevant. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we shall have a lot to say when we come to the issues that he raises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I am doing is drawing the Committee's attention—as I intend to do many
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>378</span>
times during the passage of the Bill—to the fact that we are going down a road towards tying up the trade union movement hand and foot and making it almost impossible for it to operate except by legalistic means. It will be a godsend to the lawyers. The trade unions, with a history of 150 years, have no reason to respect the law, because judgment after judgment has been class-biased and the trade unions have come to regard the law with disrespect. Consequently, the further they can get away from the law and develop mutual respect between both sides of industry without bringing in lawyers on an issue the better it will be for industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that I hope we shall give clause 2 very careful consideration before incorporating it in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During the debates on the amendments to this clause, we have been able to discuss—without, I hope, infringing the rules of order—many of its broad principles. That has been valuable. If I may, I shall, start at the end by commenting on the speech of the hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher), I agree with his last observation that we must try to keep issues arising in industrial relations out of the courts. It is that policy which lies behind the Government's inclusion of clause 2 in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one chooses to put into main legislation all the guidance that one believes to be necessary in the public interest, of course one is trammelled by the rigidity of law. That is why we prefer the code of practice as a means of giving what the 1975 Act describes as practical guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it has become clear during our discussions that there is general acceptance in the Committee of the principals of codes of practice. They are seen to have a useful part to play in industrial relations. I think, too, that there is a general understanding that there is a place for codes of practice issued after proper consultation, by the Secretary of State in addition to or in parallel with ACAS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why I say that there is general acceptance in the Committee is to be found in the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) who has valuable experience of the printing industry and, indeed, of industrial matters as a whole. He said
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0706">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>379</span>
that ACAS was a tripartite structure and that there were aspects of industrial affairs upon which, by reason of its tripartite structure, it was not always able to get unanimous agreement. That is, so to speak, a defect of its virtue. It is a tremendous virtue that it is a tripartite structure, but the other side of the coin—the defect—is that it cannot always get unanimous agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Learned Gentleman has made the point for the Government in a way when he gave illustrations of the closed shop and picketing. It was those considerations that led the Government to propose giving the Secretary of State the power to issue a code of practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the hon. Gentleman was saying that there was no place in industrial relations literature for a code of practice, for example, on the closed shop or on picketing. What he was rightly and perceptively saying was that ACAS could not be expected to produce such a code. I think, therefore, that in the Committee there is not only general acceptance of the concept of codes of practice but a general, though perhaps qualified, acceptance for the Secretary of State to have power to issue codes of practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not an entirely new departure by any means because the Industrial Relations Act 1971 gave power to the Secretary of State to issue a code of practice. He did so on industrial relations, and part of that code remains in force and was specifically kept in force by the Labour Government. They made a ceiling in their general repeal of the Industrial Relations Act. I remember it well. The right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Foot) opened the debate on May Day 1974 and read the first lines of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Bill:
	<br><q><p>"The Industrial Relations Act 1971 is hereby repealed."</p></q>
Thereafter substantial portions of the 1971 Act were kept in force. There is, I believe, a very welcome common ground of general acceptance of the clause in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the specific matters raised by right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite. I start with the speech of the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley), who said—there is no quarrel with this—that ACAS codes have a good reputation. Indeed, they have, and so has
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>380</span>
ACAS generally. I reiterate that nothing that the Government say in support of the clause is intended to cast doubt upon the validity or the impartiality of the three codes that ACAS has so far produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman lost, I thought, general support when he went on to say that the great danger is that these will be made suspect, and that further codes by ACAS would be made suspect because the Secretary of State can amend them. But that argument fails when one reflects that under the 1975 Act, introduced by the Labour Government, every ACAS code, before it can see the light of day, has to be approved by the Secretary of State. It is subordinated to the Secretary of State, he has to approve it and has to bring it into operation. That does not impugn the independence of ACAS or its reputation, I do not believe that there is the slightest difference in principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why give this power, asked the right hon. Gentleman. I have dealt with that question by reminding the Committee of what the hon. Member for Newham, North-East said, and of course it was supported by my hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Madel), who speaks with a wealth of experience in such matters and, indeed, his experience in this kind of legislation is greatly respected on all sides of the House. There are topics upon which ACAS could not be expected to reach agreement and, as my hon. Friend reminded us, ACAS has expressly declined and said that it could not, for example, agree to introduce a code of practice on participation, I agreed with what my hon. Friend said, that there is room for practical guidance on participation, though not only on participation. He also reminded us that ACAS had declined to issue a code of practice on picketing. So the issue turns, to some extent, on whether we in the committee see a place for a code of practice on picketing, on the closed shop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Darlington said that the trade union movement has got on very well with the powers relating to picketing, that it has had since 1906. It can be said that the trade union movement has got on well with the powers, though I think the more perceptive trade union members—if I may say so without seeming offensive—would doubt whether they really have got on well in recent years
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0707">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>381</span>
with those powers; whether they are getting on well with them today; whether their reputation is being enchanced by the way in which these powers are currently being exercised by a small minority, I agree, of trade union members, but my goodness, what damage they are doing to the reputation of the trade union movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be said that the trade union movement has got on well, but has the country? The intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Wolfson) with, again, very wide industrial experience of industrial relation matters, was very telling. We do now have to see whether we are content that there should be so little in the way of guidance of an independent nature to the way in which picketing powers shall be exercised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newham, North-East fascinated me by telling us that he knew well Mr. Piddington, the appellant in the case of Piddington v. Bates. That was a case as he reminded us, where a police officer prosecuted Mr. Piddington for obstructing him in the course of his duty because the police officer took the view that two pickets were enough. It was reasonable to have two and unreasonable to have three. To the extent that that decision, which was upheld in the Divisional Court by the Lord Chief Justice, caused resentment in trade union circles—and I think it was implicit in what he said, that it did cause resentment—would it not have been far better for there to have been in existence an independent source of guidance, a code or practice in which it may have been said that for general purposes, a certain number might have been generally regarded as sufficient? If a code of practice issued by the Secretary of State, but after consultation with ACAS and approved by Parliament, gives that sort of guidance, is it to be said that that is valueless and would not be of help?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Suppose we wonder a little about the independence of the Conservative Secretary of State in issuing such things?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a valid question mark and is why I emphasise that a code of practice would only be brought up, and could only be issued after consultation with ACAS, and after it had been
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>382</span>
approved by Parliament. It would have helped in the Piddington case because if two was genuinely regarded as being extraordinarily low as a number—and I am not saying that it would be—no doubt in the course of consultation that view would have come through. A code of practice might be expected to say a slightly larger number. I hope that no code of practice would ever say that anything approaching a mass picket of the type we see on television screens is in any sense reasonable. I take the view that it could only be regarded as intimidatory and was intended to be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point here is that some form of guidance, both to pickets and those who organise them, and to those who have the very difficult and delicate task of keeping the peace outside a picketed factory, would benefit from them all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. and learned Gentleman suggesting that if we had a code of practice on picketing, irrespective of it being opposed by the Opposition, it would deter a mass picket?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would help to dissuade people from making what was by its own nature a breach of the law. I take the view that in most cases a mass picket is in itself a breach of the criminal law. It must constitute obstruction—the right hon. Member for Doncaster nods his agreement in his fair way—and by its nature, a breach of the law. It is possibly a breach of the criminal law or intimidation, too. What is proposed in the code of practice on picketing which my right hon. Friend has in mind is that there shall be a statement of the law as it exists so that people may understand what can go wrong when mass picketing takes place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has a very reasonable degree of knowledge of the law from a Conservative lawyer's point of view. We respect that. He has indicated to the Committee that, in his opinion a mass picket—his opinion would be of value to his party—is a breach now of the criminal law. Will he tell us, then, why the police do not arrest and charge every single one of the pickets?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0708">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>383</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not only my view, the right hon. Member for Doncaster was fairly nodding his head when I made that remark. I am not responsible, nor is any member of any Government responsible, for the conduct of chief constables. Chief constables have very delicate and difficult duties to perform, I do not criticise anybody in either a current or past situation. But I am entitled to say that it is my opinion that any mass picket is, in itself, a breach of the law, and whether it is politic, whether it is practical to prosecute every breach of the criminal law at any time is a quite different matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman will recall that I said this morning that I would not be tempted, much as I would relish doing so, having a debate at this stage of the Bill about picketing. This is the nub of the difference between us and touches on the reason why ACAS has declined to produce a code on picketing. Surely the point is that much of the picketing that has taken place, and many of the tactics are a greater breach of the law as it stands. I have a tremendous amount of sympathy for those responsible for enforcing the law.—I also have a lot of sympathy for that poor chap this morning who was injured at the Hadfield works. But short of trying to provide enormous places in which to pen hundreds, maybe thousands, of people, the law is completely ineffective in such situations. If, the criminal law cannot cope, what makes us believe that a code of practice, whether produced by ACAS or anyone else, can? If the law cannot cope, why is a code of practice expected to be any more effective? When it proves ineffective it will look rather foolish.

We should recognise the wisdom of a letter that appeared in 	<i>The Times</i> on 12 February—the date sticks in my mind as it is my wife's birthday. In that letter the hon. Member for Carshalton (Mr. Forman) said, amongst other wise things, that to be effective the law must have at least the tacit acceptance of those to whom it is to apply. If the two-eyed people of this land ever passed a law discriminating against one-eyed people, none of us should be surprised if the one-eyed people greeted it with a rude gesture. That is the type of thing that has been happening in industrial relations not only at the present time, but over a long period. That
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>384</span>
is the nub of the difference between the two sides of the House on the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must now try to pursue my speech a little further. I shall say only this in response to that intervention. It is a counsel of despair to say that, becasue there are cases when the criminal law is broken and mass picketing results, there is nothing to be gained from setting out in a persuasive way sensible guidance as to what is the law relating to picketing and how a picket line should be properly conducted. To take the hon. Gentleman's line is a counsel of despair not borne out by experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a complicated area.—Section 15 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 is extrordinarily difficult and puzzling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reflecting the 1906 Act, it says:
	<br><q><p>"It shall be lawful…to attend"—</p></q>
we all know the next part—
	<br><q><p>"for the purpose only of peacefully obtaining or communicating information".</p></q>
However, the ordinary criminal law of obstruction is untouched. In many cases, I am sure, police officers are uncertain. I am even more sure that lay people are uncertain. Even lawyers are uncertain in many instances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that has caused great difficulty during the past summer. We believe that there would be nothing but value in having a code of practice readily available amongst trade unions, employers, workpeople and the police that sets out in a simple and, one hopes, an agreed way what the criminal law is. It would say where one may go while picketing, what one may do, and where the barrier falls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric G. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and Learned Gentleman may be about to deal with this matter, but as he is probably coming to the end of his remarks I shall remind him of it.

When I opened the debate on clause 2—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When he does I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will tell us exactly what he feels about the TUC's code of conduct. If that were obeyed in the letter and in the spirit, would that not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0709">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>385</span>
be much better than a code which some would interpret as having been imposed by the Secretary of State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I repeat what my right hon. Friend has said. If an authorititative voluntary code—guidelines such as those of the TUC—can be produced, it would be much better than one produced by the Government. I pay tribute to the TUC's guide on picketing. I hope that it does not sound patronising—it is certainly not intended to—if I say that it is most valuable initiative. But it does not go far enough. In the interests of brevity, I shall give only one illustration of that. It comes from the paragraph from which the right hon. Gentleman quoted:
	<br><q><p>"Unions should in general and save in exceptional circumstances confine picketing to the premises of the parties to the dispute"—</p></q>
that is perfectly all right so far—
	<br><q><p>"on the premises of suppliers and customers of those parties".</p></q>
In the view of the Government, that goes too wide. Clause 14 of the Bill reflects our view. That is one reason why the TUC code by itself is not enough. But I repeat that if something along the lines of the TUC guide, adequately expanded, could be agreed, The Government would much prefer to have that than guidance produced by themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have discussed the question of a code of practice with the TUC. Throughout the summer we have had wide consultations, Three times we have met the Employment Policy and Organisation Committee. Useful discussions of the TUC guide have taken place. On those occasions my right hon. Friend expressed to the TUC very much the view that I have just expressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been generous in giving way. We all appreciate that, because we are dealing with an important issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right to picket is tenuous. Almost every picket could be construed as a breach of the criminal law, in the realm of obstruction and so forth. We know that at the moment the law is vague. We have spoken of occasions when a policeman has said that any more than two pickets is a breach of the law. It is all rather vague.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>386</span>
Some of the problems can be dealt with by agreement with the TUC, which will give guidance. Either that or we can bring in the law. The code that the Government have in mind—the Minister made the analogy with the Highway Code—would virtually amount to bringing in the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the Government to accept that I sincerely believe that the law and the rule of law is very important. In modern society it is essential to keep respect for the law. Therefore, we must not ask the law to do things that it cannot do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Someone may say that two pickets do not constitute a breach of the law. He may say "That policeman was wrong. My friend was wrongfully convicted. The police ought to have allowed three"—or five, or any number. Then two more pickets may turn up. That sort of thing will make the law an ass.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am certain that the hon. and learned Gentleman will agree that the law in this country works only because it has the consent of the populace. If 5,000 people turn up at a picket line they cannot all be arrested. It is impossible. I ask him, as a lawyer, whether it it wise to bring the law into an area where it cannot be enforced and where it is left to the discretion of the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have often seen chief constables having a look at the situation and deciding not to enforce the law that day. They make an ass of the law and bring the whole law into disrepute. It is dangerous to make an ass of the law. Therefore, out of respect for the law, will the Minister not be more cautious in introducing the law into such matters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder how many more times members of the Committee will talk about bringing the law into industrial relations. Heavens above—we all know that the law is already in industrial relations up to the neck. Necessarily so—there would be no ability for trade unions to perform their proper job if the law were not there giving them a special position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our job is to try by the best possible means to see that the law is sensible, just and—as the hon. Gentleman says—generally accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, it is common ground between the right hon. Member for Doncaster and myself that mass picketing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0710">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>387</span>
and therefore criminal offences often take place. Plainly, something needs to be done. We cannot simply say "We must not bring the law in". The law is in at the moment, but it is not doing its job. Part of the reason for that is that people do not understand what the law is. A code of practice will help all parties to understand what the law is. That is why I believe it to be desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked by the right hon. Member for Doncaster whether trade union officials would be prevented from taking part in a picket purely on the grounds that they did not work at the place being picketed. The answer to that is that there is special provision for trade union officials to attend regardless of whether they work on the spot or not, provided only that they are accompanying a member of their union who does work there. I believe that to be a reasonable concession, and I do not think that the castigation in the paragraph quoted from the TUC commentary is justified in that connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the Government issue codes to the police? The police would wish to take notice of a code but there will not be special provision in the code of practice of the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) asked whether the police would be told what to do in the code. We shall have to see what comes up in consultation about that. But the police have a difficult duty on a picket line, which is the same as they have anywhere else, to maintain the Queen's peace. The hon. Member produced examples of brutal conduct. I would not wish to comment on any incidents. I deplore any hypothetical instance where any woman was dragged by her hair along the ground—of course I would. But it is because mass pickets generate an atmosphere of brutality, fear and excitement that excesses, from time to time, take place on all sides. All of us must agree to do whatever we can to secure that picketing remains orderly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman appreciates that we shall have an excellent debate when we reach clause 14, the clause dealing with picketing. He has argued, however, that the mass picket
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>388</span>
is already breaking the criminal law—an argument with which I would not disagree. The problem is that the police do not act on what is a clear breach of the criminal law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the hon. and learned Gentleman seriously suggesting to the Committee that, armed with a code or practice the police will take a different view and arrest 200 or 300, 2,000 or 3,000 people who form the mass picket? Is that what he is really suggesting to us?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not necessarily, because the police have to exercise their discretion—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—and that is one of the most delicate jobs that we call upon any public servant to perform. But I believe that, as it becomes more widely known what the limit of the law is, fewer people will be persuaded to break the law. We are a law-abiding nation and that is certainly true of the trade unions. When a High Court order is made it is almost the universal experience that trade unions obey it. Mr. Sirs is only the most recent example. He believed the order of the court of appeal to be unsound but none the less he abided by it, and in due course it was overturned. But that was only the latest of a pretty consistent pattern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe it is right to say that once people really know that such picketing is against the criminal law, as the hon. Gentleman has told us he agrees, they will be so ready to take part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one thing of value has come out of this debate, it is the realisation that it is common ground between the two sides of the Committee that mass picketing is against the criminal law. If hon. Gentlemen with their experience and connections with the trade union movement can help to get that message over, I believe that to be greatly in the interests of the whole of the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther), with his great experience in journalism, said that there should not be a press section in any code of practice on the closed shop. It is important to bear in mind that under the 1975 Act the duty of producing, in the absence of agreement, a charter on the freedom of the press was placed upon the Secretary of State because there is concern for the freedom of the press, not only limited to the closed shop but other aspects of which the hon. Gentleman with his experience reminded us, such as pressure from advertisers and so forth. The important point is that the Secretary of State was seen to be a proper person to carry the responsibility of introducing a charter on the freedom of the press.

The hon Gentleman said, I hope inadvertently, that my right hon. Friend had made it absolutely clear that the one-hour interview he had with the National Union of Journalists was the only contact he would have with the union. That I must firmly correct. It is true that there was a useful meeting which lasted about an hour, but my right hon. Friend has always made it clear that he is willing at all times to receive representations from the National Union of Journalists or anybody else. Indeed, the whole of last summer and autumn was taken up in consultation, as I know very well both to my benefit and my cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that assurance and I shall pass it on to the general secretary of the NUJ from whom I gained the original information. The general secretary's impression, and that of other representatives of the union who met the right hon. Gentleman, was that he had made it quite clear that that was the end of his consultations with the union in advance of the production of a code of practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The consultations have taken place on the basis of the Bill. Indeed, it would have been wrong for us to have consulted on a code of practice before authority from Parliament. The hon. Gentleman has asked for an assurance that we shall consult the National Union of Journalists on a code of practice and its relationship to the press. I give it without reservation or qualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not the view of the Government that a closed shop is necessarily incompatible with good industrial relations. We dislike the closed shop for obvious libertarian reasons, but the Government have shown by their approach in the Bill their wish considerably to strengthen the safeguards for individual people affected by the closed shop. The statement that the Secretary of State cannot be trusted to draw up a proper code of practice because he believes that the closed shop is incompatible with good industrial relations is not reliable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think I can usefully say very much more in response to a valuable debate. I hope I have covered the principal points that have been raised. This is a clause that in no way overrides the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>391</span>
ability of ACAS to introduce codes of practice in carrying out its own duties, in no way expresses a lack of confidence in ACAS or in its independence, but seeks to fill a gap in the capability of ACAS to give the kind of guidance that is needed in certain delicate areas of industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will pay the greatest attention to the obligation to consult with ACAS, and on picketing he would wish to introduce a code of practice himself only if it did not prove possible by agreement to achieve voluntary guidelines. But we believe that, in the absence of such agreement, it is important that guidance should0 be available where at present it is absent. I hope that right hon. and hon. Members will accept the assurances that I have given, both in response to specific questions and on the general matter of the approach of the Government to the power which the clause confers upon them. If they accept that, I trust that they will allow the Committee to proceed without a vote on the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has taken a good deal of time to reply to the points we have made and we are grateful to him for that. However, I am sorry that he has not responded in the spirit of the representations we have made. That is sad, because we are dealing with an area which is the most sensitive of all when it comes to issuing codes on picketing, the closed shop, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is sad about it is this. Whenever the Conservatives say that they will introduce legislation to curb the trade unions, there is a deterioration in industrial relations. That is a fact. Experience over the past 15 years shows that when the Conservatives have said that they were going to legislate to deal with the trade unions, the trade unions have said "All right. If you don't listen to our representations, don't expect any help from us."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State goes ahead and publishes a code on picketing, for example, which does not have the wide approval—not the approval of everbody, but wide approval—of the TUC and other bodies within society, it can go terribly wrong and terribly amiss. That could exacerbate the situation in industrial disputes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>392</span>
The hon. and learned Gentleman said that he had looked at the TUC's own guides that were published last year and he commended them. He said that they were slightly defective in some ways and did not quite go the whole way, but he did not tell us whether he had discussed them or whether he intended to go back to the TUC and say "Can't you produce your own voluntary code? What powers will you take to see that they are fully observed?" That would have been the better way of going about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our great concern is that if the codes which are to be produced by the Secretary of State are used, as they can be, in any proceedings before a court, inevitably it will be a field day for the lawyers. It will also be a field day, to some extent, for irresponsible elements within society. That is the great danger. Whenever the Tories introduce legislation on industrial relations, the only people who do not lose out are members of the legal profession. They will make a great deal of money as a result of all this stuff going through here. The codes will not work in the way that the hon. Gentleman expects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the right hon. Gentleman being entirely fair? After all, the events of last winter took place under an Administration of which he was a member. The events that we witnessed at Grunwick also took place under that Administration. These were undesirable activities, whichever Government were in office. I do not think that it is fair to say that this is just a response to a Conservative Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. I shall answer his remark about last winter straight away. There is no doubt that that was a very serious blemish, so to speak, on the Labour Government's industrial relations record. I have freely acknowledged that on more than one occasion. The reason why there was such a strong reaction in that winter of discontent was that it contrasted so starkly with the relative industrial peace that had taken place for the whole of 1975, 1976, 1977 and 1978. We have only to look at the strike records to confirm that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us turn to the question of Grunwick. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely obsessed with Grunwick. I do not suppose
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0713">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>393</span>
you will let me get very far into that, Mr. Leadbitter. For example, for the sake of argument let us suppose that a code on picketing has been produced by whatever Government, for a Grunwick-type situation and that it had been put in the hands of the chief constable. The Under-Secretary has told us that the chief constable will be guided by the codes. There is no doubt about that. Chief constables will have them—they want them. I know, and I expect that representation has already come to the Department of Employment from the Police Federation—and the police will then have to do something about it. They will say 10 pickets, or 20 pickets, on a particular gate, and there will be a mass demonstration outside Grunwick, or another place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chief constable will have to do something about it. There will be calls in the House of Commons. "What is the chief constable doing?" That will be the cry that will go up from excitable Conservative Members of the House of Commons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) will be the first one to do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He might well be the first one calling for it. But the chief constable will be under that pressure. The Government will not say "How can we get in consultation with the trade unions which are organising the pickets? How can we ensure that when a demonstration takes place, it is as peaceful as possible and that heads don't get broken?" Instead, there will be the guide, probably issued by the Secretary of State for Employment, which will say that 'x' number of people are allowed and that something must be done with everybody over that number. The question is, what do they do with them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there are five, they put them in prison and send for the Official Solicitor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. That obscure functionary, the Official Solicitor, will be very busy as a result of all this. Examples were
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>394</span>
given. The Minister, I know, would say "We have a code. We will consult ACAS. We will take its views about it. We will put it to the House of Commons. It will have the authority of the House of Commons behind it and surely people won't ignore that."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned, I think in our last sitting, the example of Betteshanger during the 1939–45 war when there were the most Draconian measures on the statute book such as emergency powers, and the like. The Coalition Government at that time realised that they had to do something about it pretty quickly. My history is rather rusty, but I understand that somebody rustled up the money to pay the fines and the miners came out of gaol and the Kent coalfield was able to work again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fact the fines have never been paid to this day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always thought that they had been paid, but my hon. Friend's knowledge on this is much better than mine. In any event, I was only about six or seven at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the Industrial Relations Act introduced by the previous Conservative Government. Statutory incomes policy on wages came immediately after that. The miners, theoretically, were defying the law and defying the will of Parliament in 1974 and the Government could not enforce the law. That is what we worry about—the enforceability of this. It is a point that I am sure the hon. and learned Gentleman understands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is very dangerous ground. It is much better to go for voluntary codes with the backing and, if one can get it, the full hearted consent of the TUC rather than go down this road. Industrial relations will deteriorate and I am sorry that, when they do, there may be one or two Opposition Members saying "We told you so."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While on the subject of the proposed code of practice on picketing, can my right hon. Friend say whether he has ever heard any explanation from the Government as to how the police and a court would decide which of the pickets were guilty of an offence? If a situation arose in which the code of practice said
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0714">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>395</span>
that in certain circumstances 10 pickets will be a reasonable number and 10 are duly on duty, and then two more come along, thus putting the total beyond the approved level to 12, will the two who have just arrived be the guilty ones, or are the 10 who were there innocently now to be made guilty by the action of someone else?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout the whole of the debate I have never heard a word from the Secretary of State or the Under-Secretary about which of the people in those circumstances would be prosecuted, and which would be likely to be found guilty by a court. It is a most important point. People who are there perfectly innocently could apparently be placed in a position of guilt by anyone who came along. Indeed, the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) could come along and stand on the end of the picket line and make those other 10 people guilty of an offence. It seems to be a matter that requires explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Most of us, at one time or another, have been involved in industrial action. We have mounted picket lines and we know what relationships we can have with the police, and so forth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mass pickets and matters such as the Minister is concerned about are the exception rather than the rule. As has been said, most picketing is peaceful, but once one builds in rigidity, such as I think that this code may cause, one is in trouble. I must advise my hon. Friends to vote against the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In moving into the debate on clause 3, I feel that we are moving the Bill from the calm waters of harbour beyond the bar into whiter water. Notwithstanding that, the amendment is so obvious and sensible, so logical and fair, that if the Under-Secretary wants to stand up immediately and save the time of the Committee, and save me having to make yet another speech. I will gladly give way to him. I am disappointed that the hon. Gentleman has not risen to his feet and asked me to give way. Therefore, I must explain to you and the Committee, Mr. Leadbitter, what the amendment is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3 goes near to the hearts of those on the Government Benches who have repeatedly complained about the injustice imposed by a trade union when, in their view, it unfairly excludes or expels
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0715">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>397</span>
someone from membership. In a closed shop, that results in the loss of employment. The link between trade union membership and employment is established by subsections (1) and (2). However, in conferring upon an aggrieved person the right to seek redress before a tribunal, no provision is made to require the tribunal to take account of the actual injury that he has suffered. No provision is made that the applicant must show that he has, as a result of the exclusion or expulsion, either been denied or lost employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, there may be the consequence—undesirable even from the Government's point of view—that some people may irresponsibly chance their arm, persuaded by the carrot of the damages or compensation provided for in clause 4. That could have a harmful effect on industrial relations. As the Bill is drafted, it seems to be an open invitation to people to seek damages without a justified case. It will tempt those people who may not only lack a concrete and positive offer of a job, but have real prospects. I shall give an example of what I mean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee knows that I am a sponsored member of the engineering section of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers. Perhaps hon. Members do not know that I am a toolmaker. I happen to think that that is the most highly-skilled craft in that highly-skilled industry. Usually it is paid, if not highly, at least in a way which recognises the skill, and that may tempt some people to become toolmakers. By and large, the trade unions are well organised in the toolmaking industry. In particular, craftsmen are well organised. They would be reluctant to admit into their ranks someone who was not properly qualified, and the hallmark of qualification is to have the appropriate trade union membership, which is usually considered to be that of section 1 of the AUEW.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A person may seek membership of that union in order to enhance his employment prospects. He may be right, because if he does not fulfil the requirements for membership of the union he will be refused admission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the clause, the fact that the rules preclude the applicant from admission will not prevent him from going before
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>398</span>
a tribunal and succeeding, despite the rules. We shall, I am sure, talk about that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The possibility of the tribunal deciding in favour of the applicant and against the union could influence the union to grant the applicant membership. That alone, however, will not satisfy an employer. An employer will want to be satisfied that that person, regardless of the fact that he has a union card, is a competent craftsman capable of doing the job. If the applicant has not served his time, has no background in the industry, has no tools, has not worked his craft and does not have the ability, he will not be given the job anyway. The tribunal is not required to take account of that. We, being reasonable men, would say that the tribunal should take account of whether the man has a real job prospect. But as the Bill stands, he could go to the tribunal and seek compensation, and nothing could prevent the tribunal from awarding it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure, that the Minister will say that the tribunal will consist of sensible people who ask the right questions and make a correct judgment. However, nothing in the Bill requires them to do so, or empowers them to refuse compensation, even though they feel that the man has no real job prospects and has suffered no injury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been, and still am, a staunch defender of our system of industrial tribunals and of those who serve upon them. The composition of the tribunal—a legally qualified chairman, a person appointed on the nomination of the Confederation of British Industry, an employers' representative, and a person appointed on the nomination of the TUC—a trade union representative—provides a forum of sensible people with a lot of experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But one cannot ignore the fact that there are rivalries and clashes of interest even within the trade union world. I can envisage—it is not a wild hypothesis—some tribunal where the employer may feel that what is before it is a matter of academic interest to him. Indeed, we have amendments down, which again I hope will be selected, which tilt at the obvious injustice, unfairness and, indeed, absurdity of an employer sittting in judgment on a matter that is essentially an internal trade union matter.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue will go before the tribunal and the trade union representative, who for obvious reasons will be the most active and interested party in the tribunal, may be a member of a union which might see some advantage to be gained from making inroads into this closely-guarded and jealously-preserved territory of us craftsmen in the engineering union. It is not just we toolmakers. There are many groups of skilled men who, like lawyers and other professional people, set down careful limits to make sure—not only out of self-interest but to preserve their craft status—that no encroachments and inroads are made into that craft status by unreasonable people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tribunal could be hand-picked with that purpose in mind. That is why what I have said is not a wild hypothesis. If it is the Government's general argument—I assume it is without accepting or commenting on the validity of the argument at this stage—that it is wrong for people to suffer injury because of the refusal of or exclusion from trade union membership, and that a person thus injured should be able to obtain redress, we ought to put in the Bill an obligation that injury must be shown before compensation is paid. It seems to me such an obvious and sensible step that I am surprised that the Minister should wish to commit it to a debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may help if I dispel a misapprehension. Of course the clause provides for a link between compensation and proven future loss. That is also found in clause4. It might help the Committee if I say a word first about the scheme of the two clauses, because they go in harness, then about the effects of the amendment, and then respond briefly to the arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme is quite simple. It confers a right not to be unreasonably excluded or expelled from a trade union upon a person who either has a job to which a closed shop agreement or arrangement applies or is seeking such a job. If that right is infringed, if he considers himself to be unreasonably excluded or unreasonably expelled, the clauses provide a remedy. The remedy, first, is a declaration from the industrial tribunal that he has been unreasonably excluded or expelled, and, secondly, compensation. If the union, in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>400</span>
response to the declaration, says "Very well, we comply with it. We shall admit you" or, as the case may be, "We shall take you back", a claim for compensation will be only to the industrial tribunal and will be in respect of what one has lost as a result of having been excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the ordinary case it will not be very much. That is to be found in clause 4(4), which states:
	<br><q><p>"the amount of compensation awarded on an application under this section—</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(	<i>a</i>) in the case of an application to an industrial tribunal, shall be such as the tribunal considers appropriate for the purpose of compensating the applicant for the loss sustained by him in consequence of the refusal or expulsion."</p></q>
I shall divert just to follow the point made by the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker). If somebody says "I was thrown out of my job as soon as the union expelled me unreasonably, and for the last three months I have been without a job", his claim will be for what he has lost by way of earnings. If he is unable to show that he has lost anything, he will not have a claim. He may have a claim for expenses of one sort or another, but it will be trifling. But there is a direct and express link in the clause between the man's claim for compensation and the loss which he can show himself to have suffered. If he cannot show that he has suffered any loss he will not get anything from the industrial tribunal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman deal with this hypothesis? A chap goes along to the job-centre and sees an advertisement for my toolmaking job. The rates of pay are advertised on the card and so on. Unfortunately, while he fancies his hand as a toolmaker and feels convinced that he can do the job, he cannot even get an interview because he is told that he will require an AEUW section I green card in order to work there. So he goes along and asks the local branch secretary "Any chance?", and the secretary says "I will give you an application form, brother, but I very much doubt that the chaps will accept you. You have not served your time", and the rest of it. So the chap does not get the job, which remains unfilled. The card stays in the jobcentre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, can that chap go along to the tribunal and say "There is a job that I could have had and could
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0717">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>401</span>
be doing were it not for the fact that the AEUW Doncaster No. 2 branch has refused to give me a card?" As I see it, the tribunal can say "Yes, you have a case. We shall hear your case."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances that I have described, the man may be able to persuade the tribunal that the union has been unreasonable, notwithstanding its own rules, and that it ought to have given him a card. The union then says "We still cannot give you a card, notwithstanding the declaration", so he puts in his bid for compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is that chap to receive compensation merely because, let us say, three months have elapsed since he first saw that job and he has been unemployed all the time, that job being vacant all the time? In those circumstances, what right will he have to claim compensation, notwithstanding the fact that he never reached the interview at which the employer might have said "I am sorry, you are no good to me"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is quite simple. An applicant had to prove two things if he wishes to establish a claim for compensation under these two clauses. First, he has to show that he has been unreasonably expelled—or unreasonably excluded, to take the right hon. Gentleman's illustration. The concept of reasonable behaviour in industrial relations is not new. The right hon. Gentleman says that he is a staunch upholder of the industrial tribunals. The greater part of their work, as he knows, is concerned with unfair dismissal, which is not very different from the concept of "unreasonable". Indeed, part of what has to be shown by an employer is that he acted reasonably in treating the conduct o0f the worker as grounds for dismissal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concept of what is reasonable in industrial relations is well established before the industrial tribunals. They deal with it by the hundred every week and they understand it. That is their job, after all. That is what the tripartite structure is all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, no problem confronts a tribunal in deciding whether a refusal to admit is unreasonable. To the extent that help can be given in a code of practice on the closed shop, it will be given after consultation. But it is not a brand-new
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>402</span>
concept that is being imported here. That is the first thing that has to be shown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take the right hon. Gentleman's illustration, I should be very surprised if any tribunal would say that a craft union that refused to admit somebody to its' membership, where the applicant had not served the apprenticeship which the union regards as a 	<i>sine qua non</i> for membership, was unreasonable. There is not intention to go behind bona fide, sensible and reasonable rules upon which the union may have agreed, certainly not in a craft job such as the one put forward by the right hon. Gentleman. So that chap would fall at the first fence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that he does not. He would then have to show that he had suffered loss—that is the second hurdle. In order to do that, he would have to show that he had been deprived of something that otherwise he would have had. It would not be possible to do that unless he could call upon the employer to say "If only he had had his cards, I should have given him the job. Then he would have been earning £90 a week for the past 10 weeks."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So it is not as stupid as the right hon. Gentleman appears to think. The two limbs have to be established by ordinary common sense criteria that will be applied by the ordinary people with industrial experience who make up industrial tribunals.

Having made that lengthy diversion to clear up a genuine misunderstanding—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not a diversion. I am grateful for the Minister's reply. I did perhaps pick a way-out example to illustrate my point. I could have chosen examples that would have stood up more strongly before a tribunal, such as that of the fitter who feels that the nature of precision fitting justifies his being accepted into membership of the union. We have had problems in that area for a long time. People have made out convincing cases for their admittance to the appropriate section of a union to which they have been denied membership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has thrown light on the subject. But what would happen if our hypothetical applicant were able to persuade a small employer friend of his to say: "Yes, I would have taken on this chap if he had had the appropriate union
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0718">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>403</span>
card." We are talking about large sums—probably teens of thousands of pounds at the upper extremity. It would tempt many people to try to rig up a case to put to a tribunal, perhaps with the collusion of friends. If the Minister is saying that, unless a man can show that he would have been in employment had he been given his union card, he should not be given a card he seems to be conceding the principle of my amendment, but does not want to write it into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the applicant is able to persuade an employer to do what the Minister said might be necessary to satisfy the tribunal—to write or to say that he would have employed the man—would not there be a subsequent obligation on that employer to employ the man?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to deal with that point, although I have been led into an inaccuracy by taking the matter out of the order that I had prepared. The right hon. Gentleman is asking about the basis upon which compensation will be payable. He said that his first illustration was perhaps way out, but asked whether there would not be more difficult cases. Of course there will. There will be cases in which there is room for doubt whether exclusion was reasonable or unreasonable. But we are talking only about applications for jobs to which a closed shop agreement applies. If there is room for doubt, there is need for a tribunal to be available to decide independently and impartially where justice lies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If someone genuinely believes that he has been unreasonably excluded from union membership, without which he cannot possibly practise his trade, it is unjust if there are no means by which he can appeal. The point argues itself. It is for the difficult cases that the provision is made. There are no means by which somebody in those circumstances today may appeal. He has to lump it. He may go through the rest of his days saying "Well, it was very unfair. It was prejudice and injustice, but I couldn't get a union card." In those circumstances, it is only fair that he should be given a right to appeal to the experienced industrial tribunals of which the right hon. Gentleman speaks so highly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the small employer who says—dishonesty was implied—"I would have given him a job"? The tribunal will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>404</span>
have to decide whether he would have given him a job. It has to decide these questions every day of the week and the union—which after all will be the defendants to a claim for compensation—will be able to cross-examine, and unions are no slouches at this sort of thing, but the tribunal would have to decide that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The innaccuracy into which I am afraid I was inadvertently led was that I was about to explain that under this tandem of clauses there is a distinction between the jobs of the industrial tribunal and the employment appeal tribunal job. One goes to the industrial tribunal with a complaint that one has been unfairly excluded or expelled and says "Please make a declaration to that effect". If the tribunal is satisfied—the burden of proof is upon the claimant on the balance of the probability—it will make its declaration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There follows a pause of not less than four weeks for the union to decide what to do about it. Only if it implements that declaration—"Very well, come back in, brother" or "Come in" for the first time—is there a right for one to go back to the tribunal to say "None the less, I have still lost some money. I was out of a job for six or 10 weeks as a result". One has to prove the factors to support that claim in the way that I have described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the union does not implement the decision, goes against the decision of the tribunal and refuses to accept that person as a member, the claim is to the employment appeal tribunal, which as the Committee knows is again a tripartite structure but presided over by a High Court judge, very experienced in this kind of work—there is a panel of three or four High Court judges, including Sir Gordon Slynn, at present. The employment appeal tribunal enjoys a high reputation in trade union and other circles. It is to the employment appeal tribunal that one says "Here is my declaration which I have from the industrial tribunal. It has not been acted upon and now I ask you to award me compensation." That is dealt with in clause 4(4)(	<i>b</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tribunal does what any civil court does when there is a claim for compensation which embodies a claim for future earnings as well as loss of past earnings.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0719">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>405</span>
The clause says that the claim shall be dealt with in a way that
	<br><q><p>"the Appeal Tribunal considers just and equitable in all the circumstances."</p></q>
One has to say to the tribunal "If I had been admitted I would have had this job and been likely to keep it because I have a good work record and you must please make a guess on the evidence as to what you think I have lost by this exclusion or refusal". Of course, he cannot say that he will be out of work for ever and a day because he has a duty, like everybody else, to mitigate his damage. The employment appeal tribunal is familiar with that concept, but it is in those circumstances that the evidence has to be produced by the complainant. It can be tested and challenged in cross-examination by the trade union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the right hon. Gentleman—I do not criticise him for not getting to the heart of the matter when it comes to matters of statutory drafting—was misled into thinking that these two clauses do not establish a link between proven loss of work and compensation awarded by the tribunals. If a person cannot show that he has lost work, he will not receive any compensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to be persistent about this but I am trying to be quite clear. The position I am trying to seek to avoid is, in the circumstances that the hon. and learned Gentleman has been talking about, that, notwithstanding a person's inability to show that he has not been able to obtain a particular job that he would otherwise have had, it would still be open to the employment appeal tribunal to say "We feel that he may well have got a job as a toolmaker if he had had a card, because toolmakers are in short supply in London. Therefore, we award compensation."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman has said nothing to make me believe that that could not happen. I do not think that it should be possible. Perhaps the hon. and learned Gentleman thinks otherwise. I think that the man should be under an obligation to say that "Smith, Brown and Co. Ltd. offered me a job that I would definitely have taken if I had had that union card".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>406</span>
I hope the hon. and learned Gentleman understands the point I am making. One thing I am anxious to do is to avoid people looking at the large amounts of damages that are available, cooking up a case and going to a tribunal on a cooked-up case to try to make some brass.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can deal with that very briefly. Unless a person can show in the general, ordinary case that he would have got a job were it not for being denied a union card, it would be difficult to persuade an employment appeal tribunal that loss had been suffered. I cannot give an assurance that would not ever have been a circumstance in which the court would think that there might be some claim, but it would be a small claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Normally, a person has to show that a job was available and he was deprived of it. I do not think it is easy to visualise circumstances in which one would have anything but a trifling claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of amendment No. 46 is to ensure that no compensation will be awarded against a trade union when a complaint of unreasonable exclusion or expulsion has been declared to be well founded unless the applicant has satisfied the tribunal
	<br><q><p>"that a particular employer would have offered the applicant permanent employment if the refusal or expulsion had not taken place"</p></q>
That rules out circumstances—one thinks of the National Union of Seamen as an illustration—where one cannot get on to the register unless one holds a union ticket. But one does not necessarily have to be in the emplyoment of an employer to get on to the register. It is a closed shop industry. One cannot get on to the register of seamen unless one has a union card.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment were carried, one would not be able to claim any compensation because one could not show that a particular job was available that one was prevented from taking up. What can be shown is that one is not able to get on to the register whereas one would have been able to get on to the register with a card. That is a practical illustration of why the amendment must be resisted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 21 would prevent a threat to exclude from being relied upon by an applicant. It limits the right of a person to complain to an industrial tribunal in this context to occasions where
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0720">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>407</span>
he has been refused or has lost employment with a particular employer because of his exclusion or expulsion. The amendment removes the right which the Bill gives to complain to an industrial tribunal when he is under threat of being refused a job or losing his employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will not do because it is important that there should be a right of appeal to a tribunal for people who face the threat of dismissal from employment because of unreasonable exclusion or expulsion from a trade union. That might prevent loss of a potential job or an actual job and it might forestall any difficulties that might arise in seeking reinstatement in a job or reconsideration for a potential job. The reason is that it is always harder to get back into a job than to hang onto one. It is for that reason that the amendment cannot be accepted by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is any doubt about it, I shall talk privately to the right hon. Member for Doncaster. I hope that I have dispelled his doubts about the Bill giving unlimited ability to a rogue tribunal to award enormous damages regardless of whether there is any evidence that a job has been lost. It is not as simple as that. The principles on which compensation will be awarded will be those awarded by the courts as compensation every day do the week in civil cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to have taken so long, but I thought it necessary to deal with that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman answer a couple of questions in order that I may understand him? First, is he saying that if a person is excluded, with the agreement of the employer, the person excluded has no rights at the tribunal? That seemed to be the import of his remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, let us suppose that a woman wanted to work at the coalface. I do not suppose that the union would be too anxious for that to happen and might refuse her a card. The employer might take the same view. If she went to a tribunal, would she be able to make out a case?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that the hon. and learned Gentleman is saying that where the employer agrees with the union, where there is a closed shop agreement voluntary arrived at between employers and trade
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>408</span>
unions, someone from outside has no rights, and that it is only when the employer is willing to employ someone and the union says "You have not got a card" that that person has some locus at a tribunal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What has to be shown is that a person has been deprived of something that he or she would otherwise have had—deprived of a job which otherwise would have been offered by an employer. If an employer agrees with the union that a person should not take the job as he does not have the necessary apprenticeship behind him, that person cannot show that he has been deprived of that employer's job simply because the union did not allow him a card. Therefore, his claim for compensation would fail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, on the other hand, the employer says "You are just the chap I want for this job. Provided you can get your union card, you are on next week", then, if the union card is unreasonably withheld, there is a claim for compensation. It is as simple as that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join with my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) in expressing thanks to the hon. and learned Gentleman for his speech. It was a beautiful piece of clarification and exposition, and, above all, made clear the interlocking relationship between clauses 3 and 4. I must tell him that his arguments against the proposed amendment carried conviction with at least one member of his audience. I want now to make one or two observations to the hon. and learned Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find that the Under-Secretary of State does not understand the full complexities of the closed shop problem, perhaps because he has not experienced being up to the neck in rt. He indicated that much when he talked of two contingencies when he was correcting the slight and understandable error he made. When he came to the second contingency, he said—I think he said—"The union has imposed the closed shop and they decide that they will do this, that and the other".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I withdraw it if I said that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0721">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>409</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I misquoted the hon. and learned Gentleman, I apologise. But the fact is—and what a lot of Conservative Members do not understand—that unions do not impose closed shops. That is something that always grows out of the grass roots. I cannot recall a single occasion in all the decades that I was on the national executive council when it said "We are going to insist that the X, Y, Z company is going to be a closed shop for our employee members".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens is that the chaps who work in the shop start to insist. Why do they insist? I have seen it so often. There may be a shop with, say, 60 to 80 chaps working there, and all of them except two belong to the union. When the collector goes around collecting subs at the end of the week, or sometimes fortnightly—or, in the case of my union, often at the end of the month—those two chaps stand smirking by. I have heard them say, and I'll bet my right hon. Friend has heard them say, "That'll be an extra pint for me in the pub on my way home tonight". Very often, if challenged, they will say that they have some conscientious objection to joining the trade union, using the word "conscientious" all too often in the most elastic way. But they never have any conscientious objection to accepting the benefits which the union negotiates for the shop workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my experience, it is the non-unionist and, generally, the man who says that he is a non-unionist out of conscientious conviction, who is the first in the queue holding out his hand for the pay rise negotiated by the officer whose salary is paid from other people's subscriptions. So the blokes become very irritated, which is understandable. Every one of us in this Committee Room would feel exactly the same. No respectable, decent man likes, in any walk of life, the chap who seizes the advantages and the rights and benefits which derive from a group action without taking the share of responsibility of running the group. We do not like such people, nor does anybody. Conservative Members do not like them any more than I do. I do not know why, therefore, they want to defend them in only one situation—the work situation, and in only one group, the work group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>410</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman is not right in what he says. There are employers who make investments in various projects. They do not expect those who come along afterwards and share in them to make those great contributions to what they have done by way of taking risks. The hon. Gentleman is wrong in his suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My experience there, and I bet it is as long and as good as the hon. Gentleman's is that anybody who makes an innovation runs straight to the patent office and patents it, and makes sure that he gets some boodle from anybody else who may use it, and damages from anybody who may violate it. Once again, the hon. Gentleman is being fanciful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat—I have to, as the hon. Gentleman interrupted me—that what the opponents of the closed shop are doing is something they would not do in relation to any other form of group organisation. That is, demanding the right of an individual who is part of a group to have the advantages, rights, benefits of membership of the group, without taking his share of responsibility for the running of that group. It is nowhere but in the work situation, and in respect of trade unionism, that such a demand would be tolerated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman realises that the two bogey men of the clauses are the words "unreasonable" and "reasonable". If one is asked for a definition of those words, one has to ask "How long is a piece of string?". They are two very strange words, which are matters of subjective judgment and impossible to define. We could argue about similar words in connection with a different Bill tomorrow. Their definition in a particular case is a matter of subjective judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were talking not of tribunals but of courts, on the racing form of the past few weeks it is five to one on that anything that the Court of Appeal found reasonable the House of Lords would find unreasonable, and that anything the Court of Appeal found unreasonable the House of Lords would find reasonable. That shows how easy it is to differ in subjective judgments about cases of this sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can envisage a lot of legal argument over this, but the one really remarkable provision—here again is evidence of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0722">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>411</span>
Ministers applying to the work situation and to trade unions criteria that are much more rigid than those applied anywhere else—is the one proposing that a union will not be able to claim that it has been reasonable in excluding or expelling merely on the ground that the exclusion or expulsion was carried out in accordance with its rules. We would not demand that of any other organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that there was a Tower Hamlets Conservative club with rules—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would not have many members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—which it would be fully entitled to have, and that one of the rules was that all members must be paid-up members of good standing in the Conservative Party. That would be a normal rule for that club to have. Suddenly, one day, the club learns that a man named Ian Mikardo has by devious means managed to obtain membership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only is the man not a Conservative but the club knows that it has very little chance of making him one, so the committee gets together and says "We chuck the bloke out. His membership breaches our rules."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I felt aggrieved about that and wanted to do something about it, any tribunal or court in the world would say that my expulsion was reasonable because it had been carried out in strict conformity with the rules. If the club had an appeal committee to which I had appealed and it had upheld the decision to expel, that would strengthen the argument that the expulsion was reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen opposite would never query that decision. The fact that my membership was in breach of the rules would not be considered by them as inadequate to sustain the claim that the expulsion was reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suppose there were—and there is not—a Tower Hamlets total abstinence society and that a condition of membership was that a man be a total abstainer and not take alcohol in any form. That would be a reasonable condition of membership for such a club. One day, one of its members appears in court for being drunk and incapable. The committee get together and say "This chap is manifestly in breach of our rules. He has breached
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>412</span>
our conditions of membership and we must chuck him out." No hon. Gentleman opposite would argue that that was unreasonable because the expulsion was carried out in accordance with the rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that the Government are trying to impose on trade unions criteria that are much more rigid and demanding than they would apply to any other group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason why the criteria must be tougher is that an individual's livelihood depends on his being a member of a trade union club, whereas that does not apply to his being a member of the Tower Hamlets Conservative club.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I hope that the hon. Gentleman's last words are correct, but we know that a good deal of patronage of one sort or another exists. Nevertheless, his point is generally right, although I do not think it a fair one. We are dealing here with a very serious matter. I do not pretend otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that that difference is sufficient to justify creating a situation whereby if a member of my union is expelled for being in breach of the rules and, after appealing to our appeal court, that expulsion is upheld the conditions are not considered sufficient to be reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Leadbitter. I believe that, inadvertently, the hon.

Amendments Nos. 22, 23 and 25 are devoted to that point and, with respect, the hon. Gentleman's argument seems to be addressed to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are important amendments and I shall seek to show that they are pertinent to the whole question of the TUC's voluntary arrangements and the extent to which this legislation cuts across those arrangements. I can almost echo the words of my right hon. Friend who moved the previous amendment, particularly in respect of amendment No. 24.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>414</span>
This is a sensible amendment which I hope the hon. and learned Gentleman will accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment uses the words "having regard to". The intention is to oblige the tribunals and appeal courts to pay regard, in assessing reasonableness, to inter-union arrangements, arrangements involving employers as well and—very importantly, as I have just mentioned—arrangements which may follow the TUC's particular procedures. Here I am talking in particular about the Bridlington arrangement and the TUC's disputes principles and procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are long-standing inter-union arrangements which are generally reckoned to be valuable in the sense that they make a real contribution to good industrial relations. There is little doubt that such arrangements could be thrown into considerable confusion by interpretation by the judges. We have been over this ground before. The judges are not versed in industrial relations, and damage can be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the attention of the Committee to the TUC's own guide on these matters. I am looking at the guide issued with the joint statement which the TUC and the previous Government drew up in February 1979. It stresses that
	<br><q><p>"Many employers recognise that the existence of a closed shop ensures that when they negotiate they are talking to a body which is fully representative and in which all the workers concerned have an opportunity to be involved in the union's decision-making processes. Moreover, in this context, the existence of non-unionists may be positively harmful to good industrial relations and can undermine the stability of established negotiating and consultative arrangements."</p></q>
Under the heading "Exclusive Agreements" the guide states:
	<br><q><p>"A particular problem which has occurred in recent years has been the conclusion of exclusive union membership agreements by one union in circumstances where another affiliated union or unions has had a membership interest. On occasions, such action may breach the 'TUC Disputes Principles and Procedures'. More generally it can generate ill-will and endanger good inter-union relations. When making union membership agreements or arrangements, unions should have regard to interests of other unions who may be affected and should consider their position in the drafting of the agreement."</p></q>
That is sound advice, and, unless there is considerable evidence to the contrary, we would say that that advice is very largely followed by TUC-affiliated trade unions.

About three years ago, the TUC established its own voluntary machinery—one could call it an appeals machinery—in the form of the independent review committee. Lord Donovan's commission suggested such a body. I think that the commission suggested a legal chairman and two lay trade union members. From a legalistic viewpoint—one might almost say the Government viewpoint—the TUC has done better than that. The review committee consists of two lawyers and one trade union official.

The committee was appointed after consultation with the Secretary of State and the chairman of ACAS. The Under-Secretary has already expressed his confidence in ACAS and so presumably, in the chairman of ACAS, and no one would doubt his confidence in the Secretary of State. That therefore seems to be a reasonable safeguard. Presumably, if there were changes to be made in that committee, the same people would be consulted, irrespective of the change of Government. There is no suggestion to the contrary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The review body is fully independent. My understanding of its operation in practice is that it has not sought to adopt a legalistic approach. It has tried hard to hold the balance between safeguarding the individual's interest and safeguarding the collective interest. It has, of course, given full weight to trade union interests and, one might say, to the majority view, as well as to the rights of the individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a court. Bearing in mind some of the efforts it has made, one might almost describe it as a mini-ACAS. Its efforts in conciliation after hearings but before announcing its decisions seem to be very sensible. I know that through that approach it tries to achieve a solution that will hold and avoid the bitterness and the recriminations which are rather more characteristic following the more formal legal court decisions when courts enter into industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know of no real complaints of substance against the operation of that body. One might say that it has been very successful, very quietly. The fact that it has not had much attention is probably a healthy sign. It has got on with its work free from the fish-bowl atmosphere which sometimes pervades the industrial relations scene too much.

What we are saying here is that the Bridlington agreement and the TUC review committee will both be seriously undermined by this legislation. In the amendment we are trying to inject a little ordinary commonsense good industrial relations practices, the kind of practices carried out by the TUC review committee, into the Bill so that tribunals and appeal courts pay the utmost regard—not exclusive regard, but the utmost regard—to these existing arrangements in deciding whether a union has acted reasonably, perhaps in terminating somebody's membership of a union or perhaps in putting into effect a TUC disputes committee award.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not setting a trap. The amendment is a sensible and modest attempt to preserve some of what is best in the present voluntary system rather than follow the Government's line and throw out the baby with the bath water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In amendment No. 37 which we seek to add:
	<br><q><p>'(12) Nothing in this section shall prejudice or in any way reduce the validity of an award made under the Trades Union Congress Disputes Principles and Procedures.'</p></q>
That follows naturally from what I am saying. It is possible to argue that it goes somewhat further than amendment No. 24 in respect of the TUC procedures, because it seeks explicitly to safeguard the awards made. Paragraph 16 of the Government's own working paper issued in July says this about voluntary procedures:
	<br><q><p>"The provision of this statutory right would not conflict with voluntary procedures in handling these types of problems. It would clearly be valuable to individuals and unions that such procedures should continue to be available where parties avail them selves of them. The more effective voluntary procedures that are made, the greater the chance that these cases could be satisfactorily dealt without recourse to the law."</p></q>
The Government say that there would not be a conflict here. If that is so, I do not see why they should have anything to fear from underwriting that belief by accepting our amendment. My belief is that there will be a serious conflict. I do not accept the Government's view. I think that "voluntaryism" is likely to become a dirty word in the industrial relations vocabulary. But we are entitled to put the Government to the test in the amendment. If they believe their own words set out
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0725">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>417</span>
in the working document, I see no reason why they should not accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 39 is an attempt to clarify subsection (11). We want to be sure that nothing in that subsection, or the rest of clause 3, makes void the TUC Bridlington arrangements and other inter-union agreements about which unions should recruit certain grades of workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are often painstaking negotiations in these matters between unions. Sometimes, it is true, they become rather bitter. That is unfortunate, but it happens. However, they get there in the end; they make their agreements and their voluntary arrangments. There is every prospect that those agreements could now be wrecked by what I can only refer to as some rather unworldly judicial decision. A great deal of havoc could be caused if that happened. The same goes for agreements between unions and employers in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As subsection (11) stands, the TUC's own disciplinary powers over its affiliated unions where they do not comply with a disputes committee award might well be held by the courts, in the words of the Bill, to
	<br><q><p>"preclude any person from presenting a complaint" or "limit the operation" of the subsection.</p></q>
I understood that the Government wanted strong trade unions with rather more central control—I do not think it unfair to suggest that—ceded to the TUC itself. In some circles that might be a little unfashionable these days, but it is not unreasonable to say that the Government would prefer that. Indeed, I rather prefer that approach myself. I think that we should be encouraging self-discipline and self-regulation by the trade union movement and, in particular, support it where it is prepared to do that. That may mean ceding rather more power in these matters to the centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I fear that unless the Government accept this amendment, they will be doing precisely the reverse. They will be making it far more difficult for the TUC to take such disciplinary action. I know that it is a rare occurrence, because it is not usually needed. A big stick does not usually work and is not usually needed. But on those occasions where that might be the case, the Government are making it far more
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>418</span>
difficult for the TUC itself to operate in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 43 is self-explanatory. It seems ridiculous to allow someone—albeit with a grievance, genuine or otherwise, perhaps with a dislike of a particular trade union—to be able to claim that he has been unreasonably treated because union A, which is perhaps not even recognised at his place of employment, refuses to give him a card when it has a perfectly satisfactory, totally amicable arrangement hammered out in a painstaking fashion with union B and union B is the union with recruiting and membership rights. Employers may agree; unions may agree but, if I read the Bill aright—this is why we have tabled the amendment—some maverick could come along and cause all sorts of trouble and ultimately demand compensation
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I am wrong, but I do not think that I am, the Under-Secretary will no doubt have something to say about it if I am. It may be said that a tribunal or a court would not, in practice, entertain such a claim. The Minister tended to make that sort of case on the previous amendment. However, I do not see how we can be certain of that as the Bill is drafted. Indeed, in that situation I do not think that it is a parallel to the previous amendment. I wonder how much discretion they would have. I think it doubtful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are seeking to write into the Bill is a worthwhile safeguard which is needed in view of the kind of situation which I have described and which could well arise and cause great difficulty quite unnecessarily. This is an amendment which the Government ought to be happy to accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall begin by making two general points. First, the Government see considerable value, naturally, in the Bridlington arrangements and in all other arrangements voluntarily arrived at of a self-regulating kind between trade unions for the reasons that have been rehearsed by the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) and by other hon. Members. We agree that in the main self-regulation is to be preferred to statutory regulation but, that said, it is necessary to ensure that adequate safeguards are available to the individual if self-regulation, uncharacteristically in the main, should fail to provide them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0726">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>419</span>
In support of that view one can legitimately cite paragraph 610 of Lord Donovan's report:
	<br><q><p>"After all unions exist on membership. But it may well be thought to be unacceptable that a citizen's livelihood should depend upon the will of a few other citizens being members of a trade union committee or branch committee. If such a would-be member of the trade union concerned, eligible under its rules, is qualified to follow the occupation in question and is of good character, then he is entitled to an assurance that his application will be fairly considered."</p></q>
7 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore we believe that there is a responsibility upon the Government, who alone can get the framework of the law into a balanced and just state, to see that adequate safeguards are available for individuals if voluntary self-regulating arrangements do not provide them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should next like to remind the Committee of clause 3(11), which is important in this context; It says:
	<br><q><p>"Any provision in an agreement shall be void in so far as it purports to exclude or limit the operation of, or to preclude any person from presenting a complaint or making an application under, this section or section 4 below; but this subsection shall not apply to an agreement to refrain from instituting or continuing proceedings where a conciliation officer has taken action".</p></q>
In other words, it is impossible to contract out of the right of appeal by having that written in to the union rules and the contract that a union makes with its members. One cannot contract out of the right of appeal provided by clause 3 unless a conciliation officer has taken action. That is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the group of amendments would be that when a refusal to admit an applicant for membership is validated by a Bridlington-type arrangement, that should be that. The amendments do not go so far as to say that the tribunal should be bound by it, but they do say that it should be taken into account by the tribunal. If we were to write that into the clause, the effect in the case of the first amendment would be to make the tribunal take account of an agreement that might be in conflict with subsection (11).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agreement could state that other rights conferred by clause 3 should be excluded. We have been looking at the several rights conferred by clause 3. A Bridlington-type agreement or a union rule may very well have excluded those. What is the tribunal to do in such cases?
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>420</span>
Is subsection (11) overridden or not? Confusion and uncertainty would result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that I do not seek to go against the main value of Bridlington-type self-regulatory agreements. But the group of amendments is not necessary. In some instances, which I shall explain in a moment, the amendments are actively harmful. They are unnecessary because in every case where there is a union agreement a tribunal would want to look at it in any event. It would be relevant to the question whether the exclusion was reasonable. If we import the provision in the first amendment, confusion will result for the reason that I have indicated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we were dealing with amendment No. 21, the question of confusion within the tribunals also arose. The Minister then said that tribunals decide on such things every day. If they have to make a choice as to which part of the legislation should be the overriding consideration, surely they can make that judgment. It is the kind of thing that they are paid to do, and they are doing it every day. I do not see the difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, tribunals are doing that kind of thing every day. When they decide what is reasonable they take account of all the relevant material. The question is whether part of the relevant material ought to be particularised in the clause, as would be the effect of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of amendment No. 24 would be to provide that in reaching a decision on the reasonableness of a union's action a tribunal should have regard to any relevant arrangement or agreement concerning union membership between a union and an employer or another union. In so far as that protects actions properly taken in accordance with Bridlington arrangements, the amendment is not necessary. But it goes further and asks tribunals to have regard to union membership agreements or arrangements which may seek to curtail rights otherwise created by the clause, and which subsection (11) declares to be void in so far as they do so—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—and on those grounds the amendment is unacceptable. The hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0727">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>421</span>
Mikardo) may say that. But clause 3(11) makes void agreements or arrangements that have the effect of contracting out of the provisions in the rest of clause 3. That is the difficulty. If the tribunal is specifically directed to have regard to a union agreement of such a nature that it is rendered void by subsection (11), one could hardly say that the resulting legislation would have that clarity for which we should all like to be responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, a code of practice could well refer to Bridlington-type arrangements in this context. I believe it to be desirable that it should do so. We shall certainly look at the question whether our code of practice ought to make such reference when we come to consult on and draw up the code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 37 would provide that
	<br><q><p>"Nothing in t his section shall prejudice or in any way reduce the validity of an award made under the Trades Union Congress Disputes Principles and Procedures."</p></q>
Typically, that would require one union to refuse admission to, or to expel, people within the sphere of influence of another union. The amendment is for the most part unnecessary. But it might have the effect of curtailing rights otherwise available under the clause. To that extent it, too, is undesirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 39 would provide that
	<br><q><p>"nothing in this section shall render void any agreement or arrangement made between—a union and an employer or with another union concerning union membership.</p></q>
This one really is a humdinger. It is in direct conflict with subsection (11), which we have just examined. It would probably protect any agreement between unions or unions and employers, including agreements containing terms limiting the application of clause 3. It would enable unions and employers to opt out of clause 3. Therefore, it cannot be acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 43 would have the effect that a claim could not be made under the provisions of the clause by an individual who objects to membership of a specified union to which it is the practice for employees of his class to belong if he is refused membership of another specified union. That would preclude claims by individuals who objected to joining a union where there was a closed shop, attempted to join another and were
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>422</span>
refused. In some circumstances—for example if it was in accordance with the Bridlington arrangements—such a refusal might be found reasonable by a tribunal. But there are circumstances in which the contrary would be the case. Those circumstances would be rare, but we do not wish to exclude them from the jurisdiction of the clause. There may well be cases in which, notwithstanding that a Bridlington arrangement is complied with, on the particular facts of a case a tripartite and experienced tribunal might find that nonetheless the exclusion was unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my experience in the law, which is longer than my experience in Parliament by quite a long chalk, I have found it very unwise to suppose that it is possible to draft provisions which meet every circumstance that is likely to arise. One can do one's best, but one will be caught out by the individual case. That applies as much to legislation as to drafting rules as a lawyer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a situation with which I was occasionally confronted when I was a shop steward in the engineering industry, where there are many—too many—trade unions catering for the same class of worker. A member may repeatedly fall into arrears with his union subscriptions and eventually become a lapsed member because he has run beyond the exclusion limit. According to the Minister's helpful briefing, such a person, having been expelled, or his membership having lapsed, will have the right to seek compensation from a tribunal for unfair exclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that person subsequently seeks to join another union catering for the same class of worker at the same establishment, and the union, as most trade unionsists and other people would think reasonable, says "Not likely, chum", he will be entitled to claim compensation again, because the second union has refused to admit him. It seems that the hon. and learned Gentleman wishes to defend that and say that we should not have a safeguard against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The safeguard against such a situation is the criterion that the tribunal must apply, namely, "Was the refusal unreasonable?" In those circumstances, it would be beyond question. We must trust the tribunals that we have set
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I0728">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>423</span>
up under the 1971 Act, and which have been defended and praised today by the right hon. Gentleman to use their common senses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Double standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No the concept of what is reasonable is at the root of the jurisdiction of the tribunals. I am not in conflict with what has been said in support of the amendments. I entirely support and agree with the value of the self-regulatory arrangements. However, I am anxious that the Committee should not mislead itself into thinking that it is producing better law than the clause as it stands produces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given an assurance about the code of practice in relation to the first amendment. We shall certainly consider seriously and sympathetically whether the code of practice ought to draw special attention to Bridlington-type arrangements. But I beg the Committee not to deceive itself that it would create clear and satisfactory law by passing the remainder of these amendments. They are not necessary and they would confuse law which is capable of being made clear. I hope that, on reflection, the amendment will be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. and learned Gentleman was expounding the way in which he thought that the amendment to clause 4 could create a conflict with the provisions of clause 3(11), I said "I do not think so". The reason why I said that tentatively and not dogmatically is that I have great respect for the hon. and learned Gentleman's power of analysis in such matters. Therefore, I made the challenge with some diffidence. I now want to explain why I said that, and how
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>424</span>
the matter appears to me. He must bear with me, because he knows that, although I am not dim, I am not a lawyer, so I could be wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3(11) provides—in simple language—that if there is an agreement containing a provision that a party to the agreement shall not avail himself of his rights under clause 4, that agreement will be void. That is fair enough. If we are to have laws it should not be possible to evade it by people making private contracts not to use their rights under the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my reading is right, it has nothing much to do with clause 4. I am not thinking so much of closed shop cases, because we must remember that they are a small minority of the cases that Bridlington deals with. In the typical Bridlington case, there is a shop in which union A has 60 per cent. membership and 40 per cent. are non-union. Along comes union B and starts to recruit workers of the same grade. Perhaps they do not start to recruit. Perhaps two or three fellows who have been taken on as new employees came from another company in which they were members of union B. They are devoted and enthusiastic members of their union and they try to recruit those who are not union members. Union A objects and says that, by custom and practice and agreement with the employer, this is its catchment area. Off they go to the TUC. There is always an attempt before holding a hearing to deal with the matter by conciliation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
