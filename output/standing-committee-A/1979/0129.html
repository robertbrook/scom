	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that at the same time we are considering amendment No. 3, in page 2, line 10, after 'union', insert 'or to membership of the policy-making body of a trade union'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I say that I feel a little lonely on this side, but I am particularly distressed that the Liberal Party does not seem to be with us again. I should have thought that on the matter of ballots Liberal Members would have a particular interest in being present. Perhaps the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) will join us in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was interrupted by the bell, as it were, on Thursday, I had drawn attention to the concern which we felt on the Opposition side about the uncertainties in this clause and particularly to our doubts about dealing with the Scheme by the method of regulations. I described it as buying a pig in a poke, and I emphasised that we were in a particularly Sensitive and delicate Situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have read the 	<i>Official Report,</i> and it is there reported that I suggested that the Under-Secretary himself had shown some doubts and uncertainties. I take it that he will try to clarify those doubts during our discussion on these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seemed to me that it is not good enough to fall back on the proposition that in these matters the Government, as the hon. and learned Gentleman put it, are content to learn by experience. To learn by experience in these matters can be at a damaging cost. We cannot afford experimentation in industrial relations. We certainly cannot afford to leave it to judges and to lawyers to decide belatedly for us what Parliament has intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
I want to illustrate that—it is closely relevant to the point—by quoting from a speech made last week by the Minister of State at the Department of Employment to the Institute of Personal Management conference in London. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We proceeded slowly and deliberately"—</p></blockquote>
he was talking, of course, about the Bill—
	<br><blockquote><p>"genuinely taking the views of those in industry. because we are determined to make our industrial legislation stick, to make it workable so that it stands the test of time and brings some much-needed stability to industrial relations law."</p></blockquote>
He talked about the overwhelming support of the opinion polls—I have no doubt that we shall be discussing those in detail a little later—and he then went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As a result recently of the House of Lords' judgment in the MacShane case it is now clear that the state of the law is that a union official can call any industrial action which he genuinely believes will further a dispute. That action does not have to he at the factory for instance of the employer in dispute or even at his customer's or supplier's premises. It can be at the premises of employers who are so far removed from the dispute that they have no interest in it and no means of influencing its outcome. In other words, they are innocent and powerless third parties. We believe that this situation is unjust and we are currently reviewing the law on immunities. We will shortly be publishing a discussion paper on our ideas and will then wish to consult with interested bodies."</p></blockquote>
I have used those quotations because I wonder—I come back to my point about not being clear where we are going—whether the Minister of State would feel able to make the same remarks this morning, in view of the events of last weekend and the quite extraordinary judgment by Lord Denning—a judgment which may be overturned yet again by the House of Lords. It is based on an unclear understanding of the law as it exists, and I feel that this is an additional and important reason why we should be crystal clear about what we are doing this morning. That is why we are concerned about this part of the Bill and why we put down these amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I apologise for interrupting the hon. Gentleman, but I think that the question he is dealing with now is on picketing, which we do not come to for some time on the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, Mr. Goodhew. I do not want to labour the point further. The illustration I have given
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0534">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
was to emphasise our anxiety over the uncertainties which have already arisen in these opening discussions and our doubts about leaving it to learned legal gentlemen who, of course, have no understanding, or at any rate no direct experience, of these industrial relations matters. These are delicate matters, and one can well forsee the lawyers becoming involved in this part of the exercise, and on the question of balloting there is a strong possibility, if the Bill is not amended, of matters being made more confused and dangerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the amendments, I asked a number of questions of the Under-Secretary last Thursday morning, particularly on the point of "office-holder" or "employee", as to which phrase we should use. The Minister said that it should apply to officials only. I find that an extraordinary definition. I am sure that he will want to amplify what he said, because I cannot understand what he means by the word "official" in this context. Is he saying that all employees are officers? We do not understand, partly as a consequence of what he said as well as what is in the Bill, who is to be covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are talking about officials only, what do we do in the situation of, for example, a general secretary's election or the election of a lay president? Is that covered? Which situation are we talking about here when we talk about officials? We do not understand who is to be covered and who is not. We shall want to hear what the Under-Secretary has to say and perhaps probe him further on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we finished on Thursday morning, I was dealing with what constitutes the committee of management. The Minister had talked about the principal Committee. We are in considerable difficulty here. The background note with which he kindly supplied us talks about elections to the
	<br><blockquote><p>"executive or other governing body of an independent trade union."</p></blockquote>
Some unions might well regard their governing body as the policy-making conference. The executive is usually the custodian of the decisions taken by those conferences, and in between conferences it is responsible for carrying on the affairs of the union. Different unions give different weight to this situation. The Bill
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
appears to see as the committee of management, as I understand it from the Minister's remarks, the Committee which deals with the day-to-day management and operations of the union, but some of us feel that management could he interpreted in a much wider sense. It could quite properly be described as the policy-making function, organisation, broad changes and so on. That, too, is the management of the union, and that is normally the prerogative of the policy-making body or the annual conference of the union. Again, we do not know where the Minister seeks to draw the line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One understands that there is a question of cost. The Government have set a provisional limit to their spending in this area. They may well take the view, looking at union conferences and the cost of electing delegates to conferences, that while it might he quite reasonable in the case of, for example, the AUEW, where, as we know, it is a matter of 52 delegates in the engineering section, plus, I think I am right in recalling, the lady delegates who do not vote, in contrast to the size of the policy-making conference of a union such as USDAW, the EEPTU the CPSA, the Transport and General Workers' Union and unions of that kind. These unions generally speaking, send well over 1,000 delegates and some of them a good deal more than that, so it would be very expensive. We appreciate that. However, we need to know just what the Government's criterion is for the setting of what seem to be very lax guidelines. It is difficult for us to understand what is meant here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are talking about encouraging trade union ballots so that crucial decisions are quite properly influenced by the results of those ballots, we should be talking about the policy-making conferences, because that is where the crucial decisions are often taken. It is often the case that the executive of the union, following a policy conference decision, is hog-tied and can do nothing. We have seen it happen. We have experienced it in our own movement. We experience it at the TUC conference. We experience it at the Labour Party conference. Unions come and their delegations and leadership are shackled by policy conference decisions which have been taken perhaps months earlier. That is where the crucial decisions are often taken, so we need to know what the Government mean, what the Minister
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0535">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
meant when he talked about the principal body, and how serious the Government are about influencing ballots in quite key areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, one has to appeal for clarity. It should not just be a question of extending the limits of this Bill by order. It is a question of knowing just what we are being asked to agree on today. Some of these matters could be subject to court action. We could have the judges involved. That would, I think, be very unfortunate and certainly if they did not have the clearest possible guidance as a consequence of the legislation and our discussion of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said earlier on that we look at these amendment in the context of the suspicions which surround the whole Bill. We are now told in some circle that even on the method of balloting some union leaders are now increasingly coming down against the idea and are talking in terms of disciplinary action against those that decide that they want to accept the cash. I hope that that does not happen. I hope that the unions do not travel that road. I think that they would be daft to risk the internal divisiveness within their own ranks that that kind of decision would create. They, too, ought to be learning from their experience in the 1971–74 period. But one can see the situation which is arising, the suspicions that are developing as a consequence of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That underlines how right we are, carefully and deeply to probe the details to make sure that there are no dark corners that lack the daylight. I hope that, at the very least the Minister will be able to say that, although he cannot produce draft regulations for a Scheme now, he recognises that it would be helpful if, at least by Report, we had a much clearer idea in writing of the kind of Scheme which the Government intend to produce. That would be a help to us all, and I see no logical reason against it. The Government have had a long time to think about this now, or, if they think they have not had a long time, I suppose one could take the other view and say that they were rushing it. But, one way or the other, it is not unreasonable for us to ask for more detail, and I hope that the Under-Secretary will be able to tell us this morning that he will provide it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
Employment (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose here is to add to the list of what one might call purposes for ballots approved for compensation as set out in subsection (3), substituting "officeholder" for "employee" and adding the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"or to membership of the policy-making body of a trade union".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the list in Subsection (3) is to set out the kinds of ballot for which the Secretary of State may by regulation set up a scheme which will enable the certification officer to pay back to a union the cost that has been incurred in running those ballots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked at our last sitting a number of questions relating to the wording used, and I think that the matter is simpler than possibly it has been seen to be. In paragraph (	<i>c</i>) we read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"electing a person to any post which he will hold as an employee of a trade union:"</p></blockquote>
The distinction between office-holder and employee is really this. I used the word "officials" also at our last sitting. All employees can be taken to be officials, but not all officials are necessarily employees. An employee is someone who has a contract of service with the trade union, and obviously there are full-time officials, general secretaries and so forth, who are plainly employees. There are many officials—the most obvious example, I suppose, is the shop steward—who are not generally employees. An employee does not mean only a full-time employee; it extends also to a part-time employee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Giles Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What then happens if a union wants to elect a chairman on a voluntary basis—a chairman, say, of the whole union, an important post, but not an official of the union? Under the terms of the Bill, the union would not be eligible for recompense by the Government for ballots. I should have thought that a bad thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point there will depend upon whether the chairman is an employee. If he is he is caught by paragraph (	<i>c</i>). But if he is elected to the committee of management, as one would assume he would be, he will be caught by subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may be allowed to develop this a little, I think that I can probably shorten
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0536">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
the discussion on these two amendments. I have made the point that that is a distinction drawn by the clause as printed, and it was the Government's view that at first this Scheme should be limited to those either who are on the committee of management or who have a contract of service with their union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a perfectly good case, may I say at once, for going wider than that. We all recognise that shop stewards for instance, are people of great influence, and it is important that they should be elected by as wide a sample of their electorate as possible. There is a perfectly good case for saying that any provision that one has for a scheme for paying back the cost of ballots should also extend to the costs incurred in electing shop stewards. The Government do not deny that at all. But, as a tried to make clear last time, we are anxious in this new venture to start in a limited way, for the reasons that I tried to make clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I then right in saying that the words the Under-Secretary used on Thursday morning were rather unfOrtunate—I am Sure unintentionally—but when he said
	<br><blockquote><p>"That does not mean an official or officer of the union."—[Official Report. Standing Committee A, 24 January 1980; c. 37.]</p></blockquote>
That is not the situation at all. I think that that is where we have been confused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I must confess that that was a loose form of speech, for which I apologise, It does embrace some officials. I should have said "not all officials". It embraces all officials who are employees. But it omits officials who are not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary just said that it may well be desirable—I think these were his words—for the legislation to go wider than the present provisions of subsection (3), and he then went on to talk of wanting at this stage to make a modest start. I understand exactly what he is saying, but any scheme that will subsequently be produced in the form of regulations must inevitably be circumscribed by the scope of the enabling power in subsection (3). If the hon. and learned Gentleman resists what we are suggesting, what he is apparently acknowledging may be desirable at some future date will be
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
excluded from the scope of the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that the Sensible thing to do, if the hon. and learned Gentleman is prepared to accept that there may be a case eventually for going wider, is to widen the enabling power and make his modest start in the subsequent regulations confident in the knowledge that, if experience suggests that what we are urging now may be desirable, he has the scope and power to do so in subsequent regulations. Resisting our amendments in this way means that he will not have that power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only resistance which is taking place at the moment is on the part of the right hon. Gentleman to my attempts to save time. I quite accept what he has said. Perhaps I should say now, before I am interrupted again, that without commitment to include in the scheme when it shall be drawn up by my right hon. Friend provision for ballots Of the type which are included in these two amendments, the Government are prepared to accept in principle these amendments for the reason that I have stated, namely, that there can be a strong case made for the provisions of the Bill to be extended to the election of shop stewards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I must make clear that there are, first, certain objections of a drafting nature, and second, that the Government do not make a commitment that the scheme when formulated after consultation will embrace these categories of persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been asked what is meant by the committee of management. It is purposely drawn rather loosely for the very reason which has been pointed out by hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite, that unions vary almost infinitely in their organisation. Some have committees of management, others have executive committees, and so on. Therefore, we thought that it would be a mistake to try to cover every title of the body which has the principal executive and directing power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The expression "committee of management" is a formula which has been used in an earlier statute, in the Trade Union (Amalgamations, etc.) Act 1964, where in section 2 the words are:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of the passing of a resolution to approve an instrument of amalgamation or transfer, the committee of management or other governing body of a trade union shall"—</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0537">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The advice that the Government have received is that the words "committee of management or other governing body" have given rise to some uncertainties but that the formula employed in the clause. "the committee of management". will be construed as the Government intend it to he construed as being that body which has the principal responsibility for governing the affairs of the union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may say so, I think that the hon. and learned Gentleman is very nearly right in what he is saying. Thinking round all the various union constitutions that I know of—he is quite right to say that they vary enormously—I believe that the phrase "committee of management" will be quite clear in respect of every union except one. That one is a large and important union, the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers. I can foresee, if the Minister sticks to his phrase and we do not clarify it further, great rows inside the AUEW as to whether it is the national committee or the national executive committee which is the committee of management for the purposes of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The advice that the Government have is as I have indicated, but if there is uncertainty—and the hon. Gentleman says that there is great uncertainty in the case of the engineering section of the AUEW—the sensible and obvious thing for a union to do, if it is minded to hold a ballot and it wants to be sure that it will get paid, is to clear the matter with the certification officer first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But we are sitting in Committee on the Bill now. You cannot do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But where, in the instance which has been cited, there is one body which deals with matters of supreme policy and another which deals with the day-to-day control Of the union's affairs, it is the latter which will be regarded as the committee of management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I have said in relation to ballots for the election of shop stewards applies equally to elections to the membership of the policy-making body of a trade union, and therefore we are content to accept in principle the amendments on the terms that I have mentioned. I hope that that
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
will prove helpful, but subject to the reservation I made that we cannot accept them in the way in which they are drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Nos. 2 and 3. Therefore, if the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) will be content to withdraw them, in the light of that expression on my part, we may perhaps achieve what all of us want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Under-Secretary's much more accommodating attitude this morning. He has possibly learned something over the weekend. What he has said this morning will certainly be helpful, although why he can accept these amendments only in principle and not in the form in which they are tabled is not at all clear to me. They make perfectly good sense as they stand. This attitude, which I have described as more accommodating, is a result, no doubt, of the Under-Secretary having looked a little more carefully at the Bill than he had before last Thursday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill seems to be a good demonstration of the difficulties which can arise when Ministers are seeking to legislate on matters of which they have very little, if any, experience. I hope that as we go through the Committee Stage he will take as much notice of the Opposition as he apparently has done on these amendments, because, without wishing to appear conceited, those of us who sit on this side of the Committee know a great deal more about the trade union movement than do hon. Gentlemans on the Government Side.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: References was made at our last sitting to my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Cadbury), and I rise simply to correct the suggestion that nobody on the Government side knows one end of a union from the other. My hon. Friend, for example—and I take only one example—spent 10 years of his working life in this very field and is extremely experienced. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman should suppose that the whole wealth of experience in these matters is confined to the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I very much appreciate the Under-Secretary's gracious apology to the Committee this morning for what he described as a loose form of words which he used last Thursday. It certainly did result in the confusion being confounded at the time when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That does not mean an official or officer of the union." [	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee</i> A; 24 January 1980, c. 37.]</p></blockquote>
Indeed, you may recall, Mr. Goodhew, that I invited him to enlarge on that point but you very properly advised to the contrary and suggested that it should be left until today. As it has turned out, it is a good thing that it was left until today. It would have created enormous problems for the certification officer, apart from anyone else, if we had been left in the position that we were in on Thursday, with the suggestion that officials and officers—I am not quite sure what the difference is between an official and an officer—are not covered by this provision in any circumstances and that they could not, apparantely at that stage, be regarded as employees. Now we are told that they can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the more important point on the distinction which the Under-Secretary has now made, which worries us considerably—the distinction between those who are paid and those who are not. For this reason, I am grateful that the Minister, in principle at least, accepts the notion that the term to be used is "officeholder" rather than "employee".

In the Transport and General Workers' Union, for example, by which I am sponsored, the president is not an employee; he is a lay officer of the union, and the same applies in many trade unions. I cannot understand how the cause of democracy would he advanced by public funds
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
being made available to finance the cost of electing a paid officer but not for the purpose of electing an unpaid officer. It seems to me that democracy in some ways depends more on those on who do the work voluntarily, and they certainly ought not to be discriminated against.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has just mentioned the president of the union, not being a paid office holder, who would be excluded if the hon. and learned Gentleman continued to follow the strict guideline that the criterion for any election to rank for eligibility must be tied to the concept of "employee". I ask my hon. Friend to consider the comparison between that and the case in my own union, the AUEW, where the president is a full-time paid official. In the light of what the Bill states at present and what the hon. and learned. Gentleman has said, that election would rank as one to qualify for financial assistance. In the union of my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikado) the president is not a paid officer. I think that that is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is not on the committee of management.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is not a paid officer. It seems to me that it would be quite inequitable if, in these two important unions, each having a parallel office, in one case public funds should he available and in the other public funds would be denied purely because one is in receipt of a salary and the other is not. That is the inequity that the hon. and learned Gentleman has not yet addressed himself to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for putting that point. It is not only inequitable. I say that it is contrary to the interests of democracy that those who are giving their time and their services freely to the trade unions should not have their election financed from public funds while those who are making a career of it should.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not in the interests of democracy. to say the least. It also, of course, creates a discrimination between different trade unions, as my right hon. Friend has just pointed out, which, after all, are independent bodies entitled to make up their rules as they see fit. It would not be proper for inducements to be offered—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0539">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
that is what it would amount to—to a trade union to change a rule which has served it well for years in order to be able to qualify for some public funds in the election of its officers, simply by making them paid instead of unpaid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need firm assurances that the Government accept the principle that the provision of funds under this subsection will apply equally to the election of trade union officers who are not, having been elected, employees of the trade union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the purpose of all this—what is the reasoning behind the introduction of payment out of public funds for the cost of ballots? Many of us may well guess what is the purpose in the case of decisions on strike action and that kind of thing, but since we are talking here about the ballot for the election of officers, we must ask what is the Government's purpose. Is it to advance the cause of democracy? If it is, that is a very worthy cause, and the point we make in this amendment ought to be accepted without equivocation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to refer briefly now to the other points raised by the amendments. There certainly are difficulties, whatever the Under-Secretary may say, about the interpretation of the phrase "committee of management". I do not know a single trade union which uses this phrase in its rules. I know unions with executive committees, national executive committees, general executive committees—all kinds of committees—but I do not know one that has a Committee of management. If that is so, why have the Government not written into the Bill a more meaningful phrase which conveys something to trade unionists?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover if this is all to be referred to the certification officer, who as yet is unappointed—we have not the faintest idea what qualifications this person, perhaps a woman, will have—it leads us to some doubt about the way in which it will Operate in the hands of a person who may know just as little about the operation of trade unions as does the Under-Secretary. Problems will certainly arise if this is not more clearly set out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems, again in the interests of democracy, that those who make the policy of the trade union should be treated no less generously than those who are the management, whoever they may be. I suggest that the Under-Secretary tells us a little more than mere talk about the principle and will accept these two amend-
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
ments in the terms in which they have been put down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Ron Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I shall be excused for being Slightly bemused by hearing that something is acceptable in principle, but not the wording.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr David Madel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Drafting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have though it useful to get the wording right, and I went to hear that done here. We have all the expertise here. We are told that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr Cadbury) is extremely expert, and we have the Ministers here. We have all the expertise. I had hoped that it would be possible to give the Committee a wording which is in plain honest English which a Shop steward and a learned judge could equally understand, or am I asking for too much? I hope that you will excuse me, Mr Goodhew, if I was expecting too much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that it is recognised that we are showing a constructive approach. I fear that most of our colleagues in the trade union movement because of the activities of the Secretary of State for Industry, the Prime Minister and others, will probably take the view that they will not touch any of this with a barge-pole. I suspect that many of them are hardening their attitude as a result of mass unemployment and the country being brought to a standstill. We are not taking that view; we are trying to take a constructive approach here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to see the more accommodating attitude of the Minister today, now that he has looked at some of the things we have been saying. Without being immodest, some of hon. Gentlemen, with the exception of the acknowledged expert to whom I defer—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is not the only one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is not the only one—there are otherS—but I do not know how often hon. Gentlemen in their previous existences put on pairs of overalls and got dirt and grease under their fingernails, went to branch and executive meetings and so on, perhaps they are all experts, but I suspect that as we go on they will learn more. At present, they look every conceited as though they know it all, but I suspect that as they go along they will learn a little more about the British trade union movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0540">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
I emphasise the word "British", because the trade unions are a very British institution. They were invented in this country. I would not claim that they do not have their faults—they probably have faults, like our economy, because we were the first industrial nation in the world—but they are very British institutions, and certainly, like all Britons, we cannot be coerced by law; we have to do things by consent and understanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I come up against the curious word "employee". Again I confess ignorance. Perhaps everyone else understands it, but I do not understand why "employee" is used. I do not understand its purpose. If there is some purpose behind it, it is certainly hidden from me, and I suspect that it is hidden from the general public. It could be sloppy drafting. It could be that people put these words together quickly without too much thought and came up with the wrong word. It could be quite innocent, or there could be a more sinister reason. I do not know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can illustrate the fact that this is not widely understood. I consulted the 	<i>Daily Express</i> yesterday for guidance, as I do every day. It is a splendid newspaper, though supporting the Government, of course. Under a picture of the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and a quotation from him about years of austerity ahead, it recommends secret postal ballots and commends this legislation. It gives great accolades to the Bill and tells its readers:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Secret postal ballots are recommended by the Government in the Employment Bill with the State paying the costs. Surely secret postal ballots ought to be mandatory at least for the election of union office bearers and the calling of strikes?"</p></blockquote>
We say "office-holders". That is roughly "office-bearers", is it not? The common or garden ordinary man and journalist—I presume that the Journalists and industrial correspondents who study these matters use their ordinary British common sense—assume that this means "office-bearers". We want to put in "office-holders", but the curious word "employee" is used. I do not understand. I have tried to inform myself, because, as has been pointed out, I am perhaps rather new to this, I have looked at previous legislation to see whether I could get guidance from it. I have looked at the Employment Protection Act 1975 where section
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
99 (2) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In this section and sections 100 and 101 below, 'trade union representative' in relation to a trade union means an official or other person authorised to carry on collective bargaining with the employer in question by that trade union."</p></blockquote>
That is a pretty good definition—someone who is
	<br><blockquote><p>"authorised to carry on collective bargaining"—</p></blockquote>
and is described as a "trade union representative".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that in some trade unions the trade union representative is full-time and paid and in some cases he is lay and not paid. The great weakness of the present wording is that it ignores completely the shop stewards' movement. The shop stewards' movement has been around a long time, for at least half a century. It goes back to the First World War. The hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) will remember that the Liberal Prime Minister Lloyd George had to go to the Clyde and negotiate with the shop stewards and they were brought into the British institutions running these affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cyril Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps his father knew Lloyd George. If Lloyd George knew about shop stewards, at least the Secretary of State should have heard of shop stewards. He must know that they are very influential people, who quite often have as much influence in British industry as full-time employees of a union. We are trying to be helpful and constructive. If the right hon. Gentleman wishes to ensure that these people genuinely represent the people they say they represent, surely it is in his interests to see that they are not a tightly-knit group of politically motivated men, or agents of a foreign power, or something of this sort, seeking to disrupt our economy, but that they genuinely represent the people who they purport to represent. I would have thought that he would want ballots for them, and not only for the full-time paid officials.

	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
Let me take the example of my own union—NATSOPA. At the last meeting I said something about our chapels and our fathers of the chapel. The management was pleased to have those officials on the newspaper on which I worked. I said that I would not advertise it, but it is the largest selling daily paper. In that one chapel there were three officials—the father of the chapel and two deputies—who were supernumerary. They were seconded, if one likes, by the management to work full-time on union work. During the long hours of the night someone would be available in the office to answer the telephone if there was a problem—and in newspaper production there are continuous problems throughout the night—when all our full-time officials were tucked up in their beds. It is the FoCs who carry the burden and who at the end of the day, or perhaps one should say at the end of the night, decide whether or not there will be a paper. These people, surely, are very important and should come under this provision. It could well be that that FoC also sits on the branch committee. When the branch committee meets, he is not expected to go to work that night, and the union will pay him his loss of wages not to go to work that night. It could also be that that FoC, being a popular man, is on the executive of his union, which means that periodically he is paid again loss of wages. That man is virtually a full-time union official. I do not want to talk about 	<i>The Times</i> dispute at this stage, although I hope that we come to it later, because that teaches a lot about industrial relations. But in that case, two FoCs played an extremely prominent role in the whole negotiation which lasted a year. We were all deprived of 	<i>The Times,</i> yet most of the negotiations were carried out by people who were not employees of the union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether Conservative Members are aware of these things. I would just explain that the term "employee" does not seem adequate. We must understand there are other animals in the British trade union movement who should have the benefit of Government funds, if we are to look at this constructively, for their election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to managing bodies. How does that apply to my union? Our constitution says—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is on an
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
interesting point about fathers of chapels, who represent a close parallel to the shop stewards' convenor in other industries. Would he also address himself to a difficulty which arises with regard to the definition of employee of a trade union? Will he bear in mind that many people such as FoCs in the printing industry and shop stewards in engineering and so on, are paid to the extent that they are employed—the Under-Secretary said that it did not need to be full-time employment—by a Section of the union, by a branch for example'? Many branches of the National Union of Mineworkers have full-time secretaries paid not by the union but by the branch. The important issue arising from the point which my hon. Friend has made is there may be problems as to whether certain people, although undoubtedly employed, are employed by the union or by a branch of the union, by a chapel of the union or by some other section within the union. Perhaps my hon. Friend will pursue that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The father of a chapel is, in fact, paid by the employer to carry out full-time union work. He is supernumerary and he is seconded for that purpose. But one is not enough. There may be several deputies, and in the case to which I have referred at least three people were paid by the management to do full-time union work. We were trouble-shooters who solved management's problems. Of course, management would have far more than three on its side. There was also a committee, and if the FoC was away on branch committee business, when he would then be paid by the branch committee, someone else from the chapel committee would stand up and become acting deputy father of the chapel. He would then be paid by the management. That is how it was done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the management committee of the union. Our rule book says that the supreme body is the governing council, which makes policy. I am a member of our governing council. I was elected to it by secret ballot. In fact, I am the chairman of its standing orders committee which decides policy. About 100 members serve on that body. We also have an executive council, responsible for the daily management of the union, which works within the guidelines set down by the governing council. If there is a problem about which it is not sure what its
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0542">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
policy should be, it can recall a special governing council, as was done last year. Which of these two bodieS—or would it he both—would qualify for Government funds? I should like an answer on this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I touch in conclusion on one other trade union. I had a visit yesterday evening from an official of NALGO, which is a Very respectable body, or at least it has been hitherto. It has not hitherto been affilitated to the Labour Party, but it might soon change its mind. I suspect that most of its members voted Conservative at the last election, but frankly I should not like to guarantee future developments in that direction. Hitherto at least it has been a very respectable body. The officer, Mr. Andrew McKinlay—a very bright, intelligent, hard-working official of the union who covers the branch in my constituency—happened to come to see me and we discussed a number of things. He is responsible not only for Newham but for branches that stretch all the way up to Wandsworth. virtually half of London. What does his union provide? In each of the London boroughs there is a branch of NALGO. The Secretary of State will appreciate that the Government are seeking to cut public expenditure and are asking the local authorities to play a large role in this. Therefore, the NALGO branch secretaries and officials are at the moment in constant negotiations with their authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every day there are negotiations on staffing, services and a trade-off between the two, a trade-off between wages, numbers, services and so on. What does the union do? It gives every branch an employee. When I saw the word "employee" of a trade union, the first thing I thought of was perhaps the tea lady or the typists. They are all employees of the union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not often elected by ballot though.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not often elected by ballot. In NALGO, the union gives every branch in every London borough an employee who is a typist. But the branch secretary is not an employee of the union, so the person who is negotiating with all the London boroughs at the moment and, again, is very largely working full time, is supernumerary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
some local councils are reluctant to
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
make cuts, for example, my own, Newham. There are others, Such as Wandsworth, which leap at the opportunity to make cuts with great relish, but they have not thought of cutting the full-time NALGO officer. In fact, Wandsworth has two who work virtually full time, but they are not employees of the union. They are employees of the local authority. Will their election come under this provision, and will there be public funds?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall he brief and end on this note. NALGO has a national executive committee, but that seems to deal only with the bricks and mortar, its investments and one or two macro-policies, such as amalgamations and so on. It has, however, district councils, and those councils have district local government committees. They negotiate on terms and conditions for local government. They have a district gas committee because they are in the gas industry. They are in the health services. They in turn nominate people to the national local government committee, the national health committee, the national gas committee and so on. Policy for the union is made not by the national executive but by these national committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a union with a whole range—at least half-a-dozen—of committees making policy. The officers who then try to negotiate these policies are not elected. They are appointed, and policy is made not by one national executive but by about six national committees. So it becomes even more complicated. I wonder whether all right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite understand that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend agree that many unions have either a trade group structure or in some cases a regional structure—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And both.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—and both. It would appear from what the Government are telling us that the full-time regional official, or perhaps the trade group officer, would be under the legislation and his ballot could be paid for. At the same time, as regards the trade group or regional committee, which, as my hon. Friend rightly says, is in fact making policy, the members of those bodies would not be covered, as one understands it, because they—I think the Under-Secretary would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0543">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
say—would not be the principal policy-making body. There would be no question of paying for ballots in those cases, yet they would be setting the policy, rather than the full-time Officials. This seems to be yet another anomaly which is thrown up by the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I think that I could close on that note—that the body in the case of this union whose election would be paid for is not the body which makes policy. All the various national committees which actually make the policy would not come within the ambit of the legislation as at present drafted, so that it would be ineffective. We are therefore, I hope, taking a constructive view to help the Government to get their legislation right. I hope that they will take the Bill away, draw it more tightly, and bring it back in a form which fits the trade union movement, which the present wording does not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Under-Secretary's statement, I intend to be extremely brief. My hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) thanked the Under-Secretary for the constructive way in which he had approached this matter, and we all understand those sentiments, but I am sure that my hon. Friend will not be surprised if I do not take quite the same view. I do not think that the Under-Secretary has been generous at all; nor do I think that he has been understanding. Indeed, I think that the only thing the Under-Secretary now understands is that he has made an appalling mess of things. In the Committee last week, the hon. and learned Gentleman said, when referring to clause 1:
	<br><blockquote><p>"but the clause deals only with the election of a person to any post which he will hold as an employee of the union. That does not mean an official or officer of the union. An employee of the union is what is intended to be covered here."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A;</i> 24 January 1980. c. 37.]</p></blockquote>
Then he looked at what subsection (3)(	<i>c</i>) stated, he looked at the Opposition amendment, and he realised that he had got himself into an appalling hole and that the opposition were obviously exposing the first major blunder in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Frankly, I believe that what the Under-Secretary has done this morning is nothing short of disgraceful. I believe that he has
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
treated some of the Committee with contempt. I do not think that he has treated the Opposition with contempt because we shall obviously expose every flaw in the Bill, but he has treated his own Back Benchers with contempt. I appreciate that one or two have an honourable record. The hon. Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Madel) has a distinguished record in the field of industrial relations, but the majority of his hon. Friends are quite happy to sit there as long as they can feel that the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary are bashing the trade unions and they are helping in that cause. That is good enough for most of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, the Under-Secretary has Said, in the time-honoured fashion because he is in a hole, that, subject to drafting, with various objections, with reservations, he will accept the spirit of the amendment, without spelling out to us what would be the form of words that he would adopt and what he would put in the place of the appallingly badly drafted paragraph (	<i>c</i>) which is in the Bill at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have had any amount of time. One of the first things that they did when they took office on 3 May, to the everlasting disaster of this country, was to announce that they would legislate in this field. There are members of the Committee. particularly my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) and myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo), who have been round this course before with the Secretary of State on trade union ballots. We recall debates on the Employment Protection Act. We recall debates on the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act. We recall debates on the Floor of the House. If the Secretary of State, at least, is not a Tory Party expert on this subject by now, then God help the Tory Party. Yet he still comes up with this appallingly badly drafted clause 1(3)(	<i>c</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the consultation papers that the Government put out after the election, in view of the discussions that they are alleged to have had with the trade unions, in view of the right hon. Gentleman's interest in my union, the AUEW, and in ballots, one would have thought that at least he would have consulted the rule book of the AUEW and consulted some of the people who have knowledge on how to conduct ballots. But, no, he has done none of those things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0544">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
The Under-Secretary says this morning that Government will accept the spirit of the amendment. He has to, because they appreciate that we will expose all the flaws in this Bill and, in particular, in paragraph (	<i>c</i>) of subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow made the point about the problems relating to the AUEW. The AUEW has always been an extremely democratic union. Indeed it is probably the most democratic institution in the Western world. Given that there is very little democracy in the Eastern world, presumably that makes it one of the most democratic bodies in the world, with ballots for almost everything under the sun.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The style and method of those ballots have been built up over the 60 years that the AUEW has been in existence, since the amalgamation in 1921 which created the Amalgamated Society of Engineers. There is a long history to this. It has been built up through constant discussions at branch, workshop, district, regional and national level to find out what our members wanted in the running of their own union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that considerable expertise and, I might add, the considerable expense involved for our own union members—they are quite willing to put their hands in their pockets to ensure that they elect their Officials at every level—we do not need the Secretary of State to tell us how to run ballots. But when he produces such an appallingly badly drafted clause as this, one wonders whether the Tory Party or the Secretary of State is determined actually to see this all work. One wonders whether the Secretary of State is, in effect, trying to buy off the Right-wing Tory hawks who undoubtedly plague his life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I insist, and I hope that my Friends will insist, that before we finally let the amendment go to the Under-Secretary will have the courtesy to tell us the form of words which, since he has accepted the spirit of the amendment, he feels should take the place of what he has put in the clause at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that everyone recognises what we are doing in the Committee. We are attempting to frame legislation. One of the things we should all be aware of by now is that, particularly in this field, once a Bill on employment becomes an Act of Parliament and goes out into the field and is used by those affected by it, it invariably
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
winds up in the courts, I do not need to remind anyone of what has transpired in the last few days in relation to the steel workers' strike. We all have to appreciate the facts of life, whether we like them or not. Hon. Gentlemen opposite may like the decision handed down by the Court of Appeal. I and many of my hon. Friends do not like it. But the truth is that the High Court, the Court of Appeal and beyond that, the House of Lords will sit in judgment on what we are attempting to pass here in the House of Commons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Madel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman speaks of what we are doing here. May I just put one thing straight? He referred to the speech of his hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther), who said that he did not know who the certification officer was, what sort of person he was, or what sort of problems we would have. The hon. Gentleman will see in subsection (8):
	<br><blockquote><p>"In this section—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'the Certification Officer' means the Certification Officer appointed under section 7 of the 1975 Act;"</p></blockquote>
When the hon. Member refers to the dangers of our not considering matters properly, I hope that that is on the record: we are not making any change from what was done in 1975.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I did not refer to the certification officer at all. I intend to refer to the certification officer later, but I certainly have not referred to him this morning. With the greatest respect to the hon. Gentleman, I should have thought that that intervention of course, I welcome his maiden intervention and I hope that we hear a lot more from him, with his considerable expertise in these matters should have been made in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) when he was speaking on the certification officer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be very unfortunate if we mixed up the certification officer with the Master of the Rolls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to indicate how essential it is that we spend time in the Committee trying to get the legislation right. Even the most hardened hon. Member opposite who is probably the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) recognises that among the vast majority
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0545">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
of the working class there is a mixture of fear and contempt about decisions handed out by law courts in relation to trade union affairs. That may be a deplorable, and working-class people may be wrong to have those feelings, but I am trying to get across to the Committee that those are the feelings which they have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the attitude of the steel workers in the private sector in relation to the decision handed out by the Court of Appeal gives some indication of that feeling. Far from matters being assisted, they have obviously been exacerbated by that decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why we must get the Bill right, so that, when the courts come to interpret what is meant be clause 1(3)(	<i>c</i>) the words have been debated and Settled by the Committee, being put in proper form, so that the courts may see clearly what is intended and come to a ruling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should point out—maybe hon. Gentlemen opposite are overlooking this—that all the elections which will take place within these terms, whether ballots at the work place, ballots at the branch or ballots by post, are all hard-fought ballots. They are as hard-fought as any Parliamentary election. Indeed, in some circumstances the ballots are fought on an even harder basis than Parliamentary elections. There will obviously be a victor, but there may well be two or three individuals aggrieved in relation to what has gone on. We have seen plenty of instances in the past where those who have been aggrieved or those who have felt that the rules were not carried out correctly, or that there were underhand tactics, have referred to the courts to overturn the result of a ballot. It is then, when aggrieved individuals take that sort of course, that the Bill will come into play and the courts will be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is vital that we hear from the Under-Secretary the correct words that he would like to see in place of the obviously badly drafted clause 1(3)(	<i>c</i>). He accepts the spirit of our amendment. I sincerely trust that we shall have that courtesy before we leave this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Secretary of State to our proceedings. I hope that we shall see a good deal more of him. Indeed, I hope that we shall all see a good deal more of one another over the coming months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the hon. and learned
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
Gentleman on his attitude. I am sure that it will help the progress of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. James Prior)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not seem to have done much so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could give him a tip. If he would like to accept all our amendments, I am sure we would get through this Committee very quickly. I am sure that that is the way, if he wants to get the legislation. We want the Under-Secretary to go a little further on this amendment. It is not only a question of the importance of clarity in legislation, though that in itself is an important issue. Indeed, I was on the Procedure Committee which said that this was an important issue, and we recommended that we should have investigative stages in which we could question civil servants on the precise meaning of clauses such as this. We might not have to put down amendments of this kind if we were able to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the danger in industrial relations that one pushes matters off to judges, and the problem here is that we shall push matters to the certification officer. That will be the stock answer on all ballot questions—"It is a matter for the certification officer." Whoever he is, and whatever Act he was created by it is a bad principle to have rules made up by the certification officer and not by the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to have more clarity. We have already exposed that problem of the definintion of "employee" and shown that it would be better to use the word "officeholder". I have pointed to the question of the chairman and president who are not necessarily members of a management committee. So we would not be able to catch those two offices necessarily under the clause. It is important to add the word "office-holder".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, there is the problem of important officers in a union—the point has already been made by my hon. Friends—in disparate committees of the AUEW, for example, who are not employees of the union and but who would not be caught by the management committee formula yet for whom it is important to have ballots. Again, the regional committees of the T&GWU and the General and Municipal Workers' Union would not be caught, so that "office-holders" would be a better
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0546">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not even to look at what is arguably the most important ballot of all, the ballot for shop stewards, and particularly convenors. As the hon. and learned Gentelman said, it would not be covered by the rather modest proposal that he is putting forward. If I may comment on the point he made about its being a "modest" proposal, if it is so modest why did the Tories make such claims for it at the general election?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn lastly to the policy making issue. There is confusion here. What does "committee of management really mean"? In my union, the General and Municipal Workers' Union the committee of management, I suppose, would be the executive of the union. The policy-making body might be the general council or the whole conference of the union. The AUEW has a divorce, which has already been mentioned by my hon. Friend between the executive and the national committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must make this much clearer. We cannot just leave it to the certification officer, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman is trying to do. We need more clarity and I ask him to think again and come up with a better solution than he has produced this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervene only shortly and hope that what I have to say will help the Under-Secretary when he is giving the further thought that he says he will give to the eventual wording of this clause. But I do so, perhaps I could offer a little kindly and friendly correction to my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton). When he said that trade unions originated in Great Britain, he was, like the Under-Secretary in a different context a little while ago, very nearly but not quite right. The first trade union leader and the First negotiation conducted by a trade union leader on record dates from 2,800 years ago. It was an occasion when a man representing the workers went to his employer and complained that they were being asked to increase their productivity without a proper supply of the materials required for the product they were making. It was when Moses went along and said "We cannot make more bricks if we have not got any straw."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
That is an almost exact parallel of occasions I have seen in my own experience in industry, where on the one hand the management is pressing for increased productivity on the shop floor without planning department, on the other hand, having produced all that is necessary as back-up to get the increased productivity. They ask, for example for more output from the machine shop without providing adequate tool-grinding capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was elsewhere and a long while ago that we had the first evidence on record of trade union activity. Incidentally, from roughly the same source we find the first evidence of the operation of a trade association. It is clear that the money-changers in the Temple were a very close-knit, closed-shop trade association, almost as rigidly closed-shop as, shall we say, the Law society or the Bar Association of Great Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary has spent the weekend discovering that the subject we are considering is rather more complicated than he thought. That discovery has induced in him, as indeed it should have done—it is quite proper—a little more humility than he was exhibiting at our last meeting. Good. There is more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth. But I am not sure that he has yet caught up with all the complexities of the situation, and it is very important that he should, because otherwise whatever wording he produces to replace the now admittedly defective wording of the clause might itself he defective as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not agree, with respect, with those of my hon. Friends who have asked the Under-Secretary to tell us this morning what wording he will substitute. I think that that is an unfair demand, because the task demands time to look at the problem and examine the complexities. He has realised the defects of the word "employee", but I am not sure that he will meet all the problems with the term "office-holder". I am not sure what words we shall find, but that is his worry, not mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I draw attention, because I happen to know it best, of course, to the situation in my own trade union and see how this would work out in that respect. We differ from almost every other trade union in our structure because we do not believe in electing our employed officers at all. We elect a lay executive committee, a lay president, a lay vice-president and 20-odd
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0547">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
lay members, some of them chosen regionally and some by other means, to form a lay executive committee. They then appoint all the employees—the general secretary, three assistant general secretaries, national officers, industrial officers, and regional officers, because we have a double structure by trades and also by geographical division. They are all appointed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the general secretary does something that the membership do not like—it has been known to happen—the way they call him to account is not by kicking him but by kicking the national executive committee member or members they have elected because the general secretary is only doing what that lay committee authorises and instructs him to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to have elections, just think of all the things which might be covered. There is the executive body, and in addition there are divisional councils. There are trade councils. There is the airways national industrial council which looks after the interests of all members employed in airways, whatever employer they work for and wherever they may work. There is the British Leyland combine committee and so on. so one has a very big apparatus indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general secretary, the three assistant general secretaries and the national officers are all office holders. So are divisional council secretaries, who are paid a small amount for all their work. Once it is agreed that "employee" includes part-time employee, then they are included. Indeed, there is provision in the rules for sequestrating a fixed percentage of the moneys paid in by every branch to head office for the funds of the divisional council to cover the normal expenses of the divisional council, including a payment to the secretary. There is, therefore, a very large number of people involved there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then, of course, there are the industrial officers and the regional officers. I have said that we appoint all these. We reckon to operate on the same system as the Government do. As far as we are concerned, the national executive committee is equivalent to the Government, and the employees, starting from the general secretary downwards, are equivalent to the civil servants. Nobody talks about electing civil servants, and we do not want to elect our civil servants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are large sections of the membership of the union who are not happy
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
about that, and at almost every rules revision conference there are attempts to ensure that all the officers, the paid officers, the employees—the civil servants, as I have called them—are elected. The day could well come when that view will prevail. I can see my union taking an awful lot of money off the Government in these ballots—hundreds and hundreds of them—and, what is more, if this legislation goes on the statute book we shall take it and we shall put it to good use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I Said at our last sitting, all the money we get from the Government to carry out the elections, which we already do and which we pay for out of union funds, will now be used to enable that expenditure from union funds to be devoted to other purposes, to improving the considerable provision we make for education within our union, to improving the Services we give to our members, and also to increasing the amount of money we have available for strike pay. So it will be possible for at least some sections of our members to be a good deal more militant than they are at present. We shall take this gift from the Government with both hands. There are many people involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put another question. In my union we do not normally recruit field officers, either regional or industrial. Nearly all our recruitment is of trainee officers. We get them fresh. We put them through a rigid course of training. Are they office-bearers? It is difficult to say "No" because at some stage in their training they carry out some negotiating functions and so they must, in that sense, be responsible. So they are office-bearers, and that means that we could have eligible elections there, including elections of people some of whom in the normal course of events drop out during training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This, then, is a much bigger problem. It is not only much more complex, it is much bigger than the Under-Secretary has realised, even after a weekend of cogitation and soul-searching. He should look at it very closely and take some advice from quarters wider than his normal advisers before he commits himself to a form of words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I join with others of my hon. Friends in saying "Thank you" to the Under-Secretary, and meaning it, for his more flexible attitude today, but I want him to understand that it is not as easy a question as it looks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0548">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because we have had a fair run round the course on these amendments. However, it is only right to say that that it has taken us a little longer than we might have expected because the Under-Secretary, although I appreciate that he has been more flexible, has also been a bit casual in his approach to the amendments. I do not want to go as far as my hon. Friend the Member for Newham (Mr. Evans) and say that he has treated the Committee with contempt though perhaps we shall be using that sort of language later on although one hopes not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentlaman had the weekend to reflect. In fact, he had longer than the weekend. He had from last Thursday morning, because a number of the points that we have raised this morning emerged in the debate on the earlier amendments. So he had a fair idea of what was in our minds before the weekend. He has his civil Service advisers, and he has, of course, the benefit of his own legal expertise, which is one reason why he is serving on the Committee in any event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would therefore have been helpful if the Under-Secretary could come along not with a precise form of wording this morning but at least with a rather clearer picture of what was in the Government's mind—perhaps with a draft form of
wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was rather worried because the Under-Secretary left a real doubt in my mind in answering a point from, I think my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) earlier concerning the implications for the AUEW. My hon. Friend Said that he thought there could be some confusion. The Under-Secretary said that if the union was in any doubt the first thing it should do was go to the certification officer and clear it up. He then said, as I understood it, almost in the same breath, that the principal committee was in any case, by implication, the executive committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That really is making things up as we go. For instance, it is not only the certification officer who may be in a difficulty here. If we get a legal challenge on a point of this kind and it goes to the judges to be decided, they will not look at the 	<i>Official Report</i> to see what the Minister says and accept that that is what it means. They
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
will look at the legislation as drafted, and, once again, we shall have difficulty unless this sort of thing is properly spelled out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, we shall not be able to go much further this morning in terms of getting a precise form of words. At least, I shall be surprised if the Under-Secretary can do that for us. However, the very least we ought to have from him is an assurance that on Report we shall get a new form of words which will cover the points that have been raised with him on the basis that, as he has already said, he accepts the amendments in principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for much, though not quite all, of what has been said in the debate. I am particularly grateful for the Bibical references made by the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo). He reminded us of the first trade union negotiation, and many of his hon. Friends disproved the maxim which was the subject of that industrial dispute, namely, that it is not possible to make bricks without straw. However, he went on to pursue at surprising length the details that would arise from the acceptance by the Government in principle of these two amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are doing here in the clause is making taxpayers' money available to unions which may wish to run ballots and which might be deterred from doing so by reason of the expense. I said earlier this morning that we could see that a Strong case could be made for expanding the availability of ballots beyond the classes of people set out in subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked what is the Government's purpose in this, and the answer, of course, is, yes, we want to encourage democracy in the taking of these decisions and the making of these elections. But we are concerned by the fact that this is a brand-new exercise. We are advised that there is nothing like it in the world. It is untried. Therefore, we want to start, as I Said earlier, in a modest and limited way, partly because we want to know what the implications in terms of cost may be. Therefore, we began by saying that we would limit it as we do, as we have in the printed clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the purpose of the amendment is to enlarge the list which the Secretary of State may include in the scheme, and that we accept. We think it right that the Secretary of State should be able to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0549">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
enlarge his scheme to take account of those who are officials, office-holders and members of a policy-making committee. The reason we cannot accept the proposed wording is that we want to think closely about the implications of the words and make quite sure that they are right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who have pressed us today—I was surprised that we were pressed for a specific wording today—were gently rebuked by the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow, who said that it was quite unreasonable. We propose to think about what has been said today and to come forward on Report with wording which we believe to be reliable. We quite take on board the point that there is an almost infinite variety of arrangements within unions, and we want to consider therefore the position of certain people who may not be employed by unions. More than one hon. Member has pointed to officials who may not be employed by unions. We want to take on board the position of people who are on one sort of policy-making body and not on another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by saying that it has been an interesting and valuable debate. We have noted the points that have been made and are in sympathy with the purpose of the amendments. We cannot accept them as they stand for the reasons I have given. The Government do not give an assurance that when the scheme is made in the first instance it will cover those classes that are embraced in the amendment, but that is true of every other class that is set out in subsection (3). On that basis, I do not think I can assist the Committee further. I invite the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant), if he thinks fit, to withdraw the amendment on the basis of what I have said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric G. Varley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not take more than a second or two to thank the Under-Secretary for his reply. He and his hon. Friends now realise that this is a complex matter, and while there may at some stage during our proceedings this morning have been rumblings of discontent that we are probably taking too much time, everyone has realised now as a result of what has been said by my hon. Friends that it is a very complex matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The examples that have been given of what takes place in the EEPTU, the T&GWU, NATSOPA and the NUM have been generally helpful to the Committee. I hope that the hon. and learned
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
Gentleman, now he has given the undertaking to consider the matter further, will be able to confirm that he accepts in principle both amendments. We look forward to having an amendment which embraces them on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have only one clause in the Bill on ballots. In many respects hon. Gentlemen put great store on ballots. It is their sincere ideological belief that, if only ballots were more readily accessible, industrial relations would be better. As a result of what has been said by my hon. Friends this morning, they realise now that it is not as simple as that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that there are divisions within the Government about the extent of ballots and who should apply to qualify under this scheme. I listened to the Prime Minister being interviewed by Mr. Walden on "Weekend World" a fortnight ago. She rather implied that, once the provisions are in the Bill, there will be a surge of ordinary rank and file union opinion which will compel people to take the money and have the ballots. It will not work like that. The Secretary of State realises it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State is coming under a great deal of attack from some ill-informed quarters. I should like to place on record that I thought that the article in the 	<i>Sunday Express</i> by Lord George-Brown was most unfair in the way it attacked the right hon. Gentleman on what I know he believes to be a genuine attempt in this clause to take into account the views of the TUC. We want to encourage the Secretary of State to take the views of the TUC into account when considering this matter further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those few words, on behalf of the Opposition I conclude by saying that it would be our wish to withdraw the amendment on the understanding that the Under-Secretary of State will put forward his own amendment on Report to deal with the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 2, line 14, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>f</i>) obtaining a decision or ascertaining the views of members of a trade union on an application by that trade union for recognition by an employer."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0550">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
I confidently expect that, whereas the Under-Secretary gave some hesitant and timid approval to the amendment which we have just disposed of, he will at once offer wildly enthusiastic acceptance of this one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Right hon. and hon. Gentlemen have often expressed the view—it is one that I support—that it is desirable that decisions about groups of workers joining or not joining a trade union or a specific trade union should be taken on the basis of the wishes of that group of workers or, if they have divided wishes, on the wishes of a majority of that group of workers. I know that sometimes spokesmen for the Government side like to present those of us who have been involved for many years—sometimes all our lives—in the work of trade unions as being somehow opposed to democratic institutions within the union movement and as being somehow in favour of rule by a self-selected establishment. But that is an extremely unfair charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is most of all the people who have devoted their lives, sometimes with little reward or no reward at all, to helping a trade union carry out its function who are most keen that the exercise of that function shall be in accordance with the wishes of the members of the union. I have always been pro-ballots of all sorts, provided that they are conducted in a way which ensures that the members of the union exercise their decision of their own volition and in their own way and not under any pressures or undue influence. That proviso is very important in our circumstances. I want people elected by members of the union and not by newspapers, which happens, I fear, in some cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that there are already provisions under which the sort of ballot which is described in this amendment may take place. I hope that we all welcome that, but I hope that we would all equally think that, if that is desirable, it is desirable that is should he facilitated to the greatest possible extent. If the Government provide, as they are seeking to provide in this clause, that the question whether there should be a ballot for this, that or the other should be decided on its own merits and not artificially on the question whether there is money available to pay for it—if that is what the Government are up to, as manifestly it is they ought to
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
apply the principle to ensure that the question of a ballot being taken to decide whether a particular group of workers want to join a union or a particular trade union is decided on the merits of the question and not on whether there is money available. That is the simple point of this amendment. I hope that I am right in thinking that it will commend itself to the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Minister will reject this proposal. It is shot through with difficulties and problems, and I shall not detain the Committee by going through all of them. Suffice it to say that if a ballot were to he held in the circumstances put forward. I presume that it could apply only to those members of a trade union. I fail therefore to see how it will help, since in a recognition situation so often what is equally important, if not more important, is the views of those who do not belong to the trade union. It will also, I should have thought, pose problems with regard to which trade union. We may well find a situation in which one or more trade unions are seeking recognition from an employer, and if the matter were to carried through to some form of industrial dispute—there have been several in recent years—in which part of the work force are dismissed for breach of their contracts and are not either at that stage or subsequently to he reinstated, that will further complicate the problems involved.

It is noteworthy that in the course of consultation they have not been asked on behalf of anybody to enlarge in this sense the purposes set out in subsection (3). The amendments which we have just debated in a sense enlarge
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0551">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
the type of ballots or the type of purposes of ballots already Set out in subsection (3). We think, however, that this purpose is different in principle and is not one which is justified by anything which has been represented to us at all in the course of our consultations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Generally speaking, there is by no means the difficulty within a union of determining whether or not its members wish the union to press for recognition, but there is in determining other matters already set out in subsection (3). We have been made aware of no evidence that unions found difficulty with this, that members are dissatisfied because they have not been consulted prior to a recognition application, or that problems in this area have arisen through non-consultation with members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are anxious, as I have said, to keep the cost of the potential cost of this power to a reasonable minimum. We want to see how we go on. I must resist the amendment for those reasons, and, indeed, the reasons suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) when he recited some of the difficulties, in which I respectfully agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because we see this to be in a completely different category we resist the amendment, and I shall invite my right hon. and hon. Friends to vote against it if it is pressed to a Division. I hope, however, the matter having been raised, that we can proceed without a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 2, leave out lines 15 and 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a genuinely probing amendment. We are worried particularly about the wording in line 15, "such other purposes". In a sense, I must return to our anxiety about doing things by regulation, drawing up a scheme by regulation, without at this stage having any real knowledge of the details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the things that comes to my mind here is the whole question of mandatory ballots. I know that the Government will say that they have nothing of that sort in mind, but there is certainly a grave suspicion in the trade union movement that this is the road we may be treading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) referred earlier
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
to those who believe balloting to be some kind of panacea, thinking that everything will be that much better. It will not work that way. One wonder whether Ministers understand that their scheme will not make a great deal of difference. As my hon Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) said last Thursday, people will not suddenly go in for lots of ballots just because they will get some extra money. That is not the reason why trade unions do or do not ballot. It is not the financial aspect. I am inclined to think that here or there at the margin perhaps it could tip the scales, but I put it no higher than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When it is found that this part of the Bill will not have any dramatic effect, there may well be a temptation for Ministers to go up the road towards mandatory ballots. I do not think that the Secretary of State himself would be anxious to do so, but we know that he is not entirely master in his own house in this matter. There are others within the Cabinet with strong views, and the conservative Party when in government previously did go up precisely that road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these circumstances, and seeing this open door, one wonders whether we could find that as a result of an order sprung on us perhaps late one night mandatory ballots were being imposed. We have already experienced under this Government several orders brought in on industrial relations matters, particularly related to the Employment Protection Act, where they have—one might almost say at the drop of a hat—sprung Something on a somewhat unsuspecting House and pushed it through late at night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To do such a thing in this situation would be to make a very fundamental change. On the other hand, it is the sort of thing that is causing anxiety in trade union minds. One wonders whether it could be done—not whether it would be done—as a result of an order in the form laid out in the Bill. But that is not the case at present. The Under-Secretary has talked about consultation, saying that he had had no requests for the kind of development on recognition disputes that my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow just raised. What consultation has he had about using the Bill for other purposes, and what has been raised with him? What are the other purposes in the Government's mind—perhaps no more than that at this Stage—and why do
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0552">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
they feel it necessary to have these words in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask my hon. and learned Friend if he could also give us an answer on one other point? Will it be possible for a ballot to be used under this scheme, presumably using the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"and such other purposes"</p></blockquote>
if there is to be a ballot in connection with a union closed Shop? In clause 6 there are the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…if a ballot has been held on the question whether the agreement should apply in relation to them and not less than 80 per cent. of those entitled to vote ….</p></blockquote>
Since this Bill envisages there being ballots in that situation, to a very high order, one hopes, I wonder whether this would be included, or am I to assume that the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"amending the rules of a trade union"</p></blockquote>
in clause 1(3)(	<i>d</i>) would be the ones that would cover such a ballot, were it sought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first point is whether this provision, by some sleight of hand, late at night, as I think the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) envisaged, would enable the Government to provide for mandatory ballots. The answer to that is categorically "No". There is nothing in the clause, however subsection (3) could be amended, which could empower the Government to require mandatory ballots. That is absolutely clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are the Government then saying that they have absolutely no intention of ever introducing mandatory ballots?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, no one with any sense uses the word "never" or "ever" in Parliament. That is why I just used the other phrase. As I have made perfectly clear, it is not the Government's intention to require mandatory ballots. It is the intention of the Government, to which effect has been given in the Bill, to make taxpayers' money available for the reimbursement of unions where they have held ballots of a certain type, if they wish to do so. The Government are saying "Do not
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
be put off. If you are worried about the expense, here is the money, provided that you bring yourselves within the type of ballots which are set out in subsection (3) and can satisfy the certification officer that you have complied with the conditions that will be set out in the scheme to be made by the Secretary of State. There is nothing sinister in this, and it is difficult to see how there could be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) provides that the clause applies
	<br><blockquote><p>"to a ballot if the purpose of the question to be voted upon (or if there is more than one such question, the purpose of any of them) falls within the purposes mentioned"</p></blockquote>
in the next subsection. We have looked at these now and well understand them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just as the Government felt it right to accept in principle the proposed addition which was the subject of the two earlier amendments, so the Government feel that it may be wise to include in the clause
	<br><blockquote><p>"and such other purposes as the Secretary of State may by order specify."</p></blockquote>
Orders have to be approved by the well known procedure of the House, in this case under subsection (6) of the clause. There is nothing here which has any bearing on the question whether there should be a mandatory ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) asked if this could be used for ballots on a closed shop. It is perfectly right that under clause 6 it is proposed that employers who wish to avail themselves of it shall have the protection of what is now section 58 of the Employment Protection Act. If they wish to make a closed shop agreement and subsequently to dismiss a worker who has not joined the trade union with which the closed shop agreement has been made, section 58 says that they may do that. If one has made a closed shop agreement and one subsequently wishes to dismiss someone for not joining the union, one is protected from any claim for compensation for unfair dismissal. Under the provisions of the Bill to which my hon. Friend has alluded, the intention is to enlarge the rights of individuals, and in particular of existing employees, in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, to that end and to other ends as well, there is a provision that the employer shall hold a ballot and get a "Yes" vote from 80 per cent. or more of the workers who are likely to be affected.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0553">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
My hon. Friend asks whether that kind of ballot will be within the purposes of this subsection. The answer is that it could be because the clause allows my right hon. Friend to include any other purpose within the clause of the Bill by order. It is very unlikely that that would apply because that type of ballot is a ballot which would be held by the employer, and the union is not in ordinary circumstances expected to be the initiator of such a ballot, though it might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ballot in that context is a ballot of everybody who would be affected and not just union members. Therefore, it is very unlikely that this provision would be used in those circumstances. But I believe myself to be right in saying that technically a union, if it wished to conduct a ballot itself and although it was conducting a ballot only of its own members, could bring itself within it. It is an academic question, with respect, and not one which is likely in practice to arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have dealt sufficiently with the points which have been raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did not deal with my question about what other possibilities had been raised with the Government in consultation for inclusion in the balloting provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer that from the top of my head, but I am not aware of any other purposes which have been pressed upon the Government for inclusion in the clause other than those which find a mention in subsection (3). at any rate, those which are included in subsection (3) represent what the government regard as the most important ballots for which the costs are most worthy for reimbursement under the terms of the clause. I am not aware of any other purpose, although I am not saying categorically that there were none.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point, of course, that there is nothing in the clause which provides for a mandatory ballot. That is what Mr. Punch used to call a glimpse of the obvious. I am sure that all hon. Members appreciated that even before the Under-Secretary spelt it out so clearly, if a little repetitively. Nevertheless, I do not think that he can dismiss so lightly the import of lines 15 and 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole of the Government's think
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
ing is that the provision of money will create more ballots. They think that it will he an inducement to people to carry out ballots which they would not otherwise carry out. If there is anything in their analysis at all, it must be that as a result of the legislation in this clause there will be ballots carried out on all the purposes listed in paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) to (	<i>e</i>) to a greater extent than was the case before the passage of the Bill. So we are talking about creating more ballots, even if we are not talking about creating them under mandatory powers. If we are talking about that, the width of the purposes for which the ballots may be created is a matter which demands careful consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lines 15 and 16 are a blank cheque. They can mean anything at all. Indeed, I put it to the Under-Secretary that if we are to have lines 15 and 16 there is no need to have lines I to 14. All that was needed in subsection (1) was not "such ballots to which" and so on, but "any ballots which the Secretary of State may authorise". He could have done without paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) to (	<i>e</i>) which have taken up so much of the Committee's time and caused the Under-Secretary a couple of sleepless nights over the weekend. We could simply have said "any ballot which is authorised by the Secretary Of State for any purpose whatsoever."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not just being colourful. I put it seriously that paragraphs (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>), (	<i>c</i>), (	<i>d</i>) and (	<i>e</i>) followed by
	<br><blockquote><p>"and such other purposes as the Secretary of State may by order specify"</p></blockquote>
is precisely equivalent to "any ballots which the Secretary of State may by order specify". If that had been said in subsections (1) or (2), one could envisage considerable objection to it, but that is precisely the effect of what is here being done by lines 15 and 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State has these five purposes which are set out—there will be plenty of balloting under them, as I have already said—he ought to be content to rest with them except to the extent that he can add to them by amending legislation. This power is too big to be exercised by an unamendable Order in Council. We have all come to the conclusion already in the course of the short life Of the Committee, if we did not know it before, and pretty well all of us knew it before—certainly, the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State did—that we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0554">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
are here dealing with an area of activity which is both Sensitive and complex, and a sensitive and complex area ought not to be legislated for in procedures which are unamendable—take it or leave it, it is unchangeable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that very few issues were less suitable for procedure by delegated legislation than this sensitive and complex subject. The blank cheque is too blank. The authority is too wide. The Government ought not to be demanding it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary of State has said that the meaning of these words is entirely innocent and I am willing to accept that, in his present frame of mind, he believes that to be so, but he must agree that the words read very starkly:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Such other purposes as the Secretary of State may by order specify."</p></blockquote>
There is a lot of criticism, or a lot of suspicion, of the Bill outside. There are long memories in the trade union movement of legislation from previous Conservative Governments who wanted compulsory ballots. When my hon. Friend asked the hon. and learned Gentleman whether he could rule out completely, so that we could completely clear our minds, any possibility that there would ever he a mandatory ballot, he wisely said that he could not do that. Therefore the thought will be at the back of some peoples' minds that such situations could be envisaged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there not the further point that, while lines 15 and 16 may be all right with the present team in the Department of Employment and with the present employment policy, what happens if we get a different team, perhaps supported by the hard-line people in the Conservative Parliamentary Party? What happens then? Of course, lines 15 and 16 become much more dangerous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely the point that I had in mind. I wonder whether, in the accommodating frame of mind that the Under-Secretary is in, he might do the same thing here as he did with the previous issue and agree to take it away and think about it and, perhaps come back with a slightly amended wording. For example, he could Say "Such
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
other purposes as the Secretary of State may, with the agreement of the union or unions concerned, by order specify"—in other words, not that he would do it just by order but do it with the agreement of the trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he were to do that, he would satisfy everybody, I think, and the trade union movement outside the House would be happier than with these Stark words. But unless that is done, if they are left in here as they stand, there will be grave misgivings on the part of many people in the trade union movement outside the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can make it clear to the hon. Gentleman. I missed a little bit of this debate and I think that my hon. and learned Friend may have covered the point, but I should like to make absolutely clear that there is no provision within the clause for mandatory power for ballots. I want to make it abundantly clear that that is not the purpose of this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the whole Committee is fully prepared to accept what the right hon. Gentleman has just said and, indeed, what the Under-Secretary said earlier. But the Under-Secretary has still not matched up to what the Committee is seeking; he has not told us the purpose of these words. We know now what they are not going to do, but what we do not know is what the Government have in mind that they might be used for. Presumably, they had something in mind when they put the words in. They envisaged the possibility of Something that they had not seen fit to put into paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) to (	<i>e</i>), but we have not been told. I fully endorse everything that has been said by my hon. Friends on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to press the hon. and learned Gentleman, on a rather different point and I am prompted to do so by the presence of the Secretary of State, who was not present when we spent almost the whole of our first sitting discussing the inadequacy, or the complete absence, of arrangements for consultation. Indeed, we had an amendment down to qualify the use of the power in lines 15 and 16 by putting on the Government an obligation at least to consult the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service. That seemed to us to be a very modest and reasonable proposal to make at the time, but to our astonishment the Government insisted on refusing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0555">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
I ask the Under-Secretary, and more particularly his right hon. Friend, to look again at the arguments that we advanced last week. I was scrupulously careful not to trespass on this amendment in my remarks last week and did not make the case that I ought perhaps to have made about the importance of qualifying these sweeping powers by putting on the Government an obligation of consult. Perhaps that is what they ought to do now to mitigate what seems to me to be a rather offensive provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am echoing the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton), who has just suggested that perhaps there ought to be an obligation to consult the unions. I am bound to say that I was tempted at our proceedings last week, and resisted it only because of restraint, to table a further amendment that would have gone beyond merely requiring consultation and would have made the exercise of these powers in lines 15 and 16 conditional upon the consent of the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Out of a wish to See the Committee make some progress and because we had this particular amendment done, I refrained from doing that. The Government owe it to us to assuage our legitimate anxieties by making clear that they will be prepared to consider putting in the Bill in recognition of our anxiety something that will require consultation with an outside body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee shares my view that the appropriate independent body that has the experience and expertise would be the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service. But, in the absence of such an obligation I am bound to echo what has already been said, while seeking not to be repetitive, that this really is a blank cheque for the Secretary of State and his successors, who may not be so reasonable and amenable in these matters as the present Secretary of State, to do whatever they wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to take only a moment of the Committee's time to make clear that it is not good enough for the Secretary of State to put his hand on his heart and assure us that there is absolutely no intention of introducing compulsory or mandatory ballots in this clause. We accept that the right hon. Gentleman will not so use the powers, but he has been in
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
Parliament long enough to know that he cannot bind any successor Secretary of State for Employment. Unless it is spelt out in the Bill, we are not prepared to accept it, although we accept the spirit of the right hon. Gentleman's words</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prior</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put the hon. Gentleman right? There is no power in the clause itself. It has nothing to do with what I might think as Secretary of State; there is no power in the clause itself. That is the important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest of respect to the right hon. Gentleman, I do not think that he can say that, because the powers in lines 15 and 16 are so wide that he knows as well as I do that a Subsequent Secretary of State may interpret those words in an entirely different way. Does my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and bow (Mr. Mikardo) wish to intervene?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was seeking to protect the right hon. Gentleman, although he went some way to do it himself, from being misquoted by my hon. Friend. My hon. Friend quoted him as saying that there would not be any mandatory ballots ever. The right hon. Gentleman did not say that. He said that there was no provision in the clause for mandatory ballots. That is a very different thing from an undertaking that there would not be subsequent legislation brought in by this Government to make ballots mandatory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. That was really the point to which I wished to draw attention. I listened carefully to the Secretary of State on Second Reading and I took note of his words at the time. It is worth looking at his words again:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The clause does not make ballots compulsory, although many people believe it should." [	<i>official Report,</i> 17 December 1979; Volume 976, c. 61.]</p></blockquote>
I have no doubt whatever that the "many people" to whom the right hon. Gentleman was referring are within his own party's ranks and within his own Cabinet. Certainly, if no one else has any fears on that score, I have fears, and, as I have made clear on three occasions now, I am a member of a union which holds ballots for everything. I support the provision of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0556">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
secret ballots whenever it is possible to hold them but I do not accept that we should put blanket powers in a Bill which would allow the Secretary of State, or any subsequent Secretary of State, to come along and by order specify
	<br><blockquote><p>"any such other purposes".</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend earlier referred to the question of consulting the trade unions. I agree with that, and with consulting the TUC or, as my right hon. Friend said, consulting ACAS. But what about consulting the House of Commons? Should the words not he amended in such a way that if the Secretary of State wishes to impose such blanket powers in this important subject it should be necessary to consult both Houses of Parliament by the affirmative procedure rather than in this fashion?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would do the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends the world of good just to recall that after the passage of our great Employment Protection Act, we discovered after interpretation in the courts that there were weaknesses in the Act and my hon. Friends the Members for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher), for Bethnal Green and bow (Mr. Mikardo) and for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) attempted to put Private Members' Bills through the House to bring the Act back to what we thought it was when it left the House. If the Labour Government had put blanket powers Such as are in this clause in the Employment Protection Act, it may well be that my hon. Friends need not have wasted So much time in seeking to put Private Members' Bills through the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other and far more important issue was the one raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow, because, quite frankly, we can reduce all Bills to one-clause Bills, no matter what the subject, if we include words like
	<br><blockquote><p>"any such other purposes as the Secretary of State may by order specify."</p></blockquote>
The duty of the House and its Standing Committees is to go through legislation and try to ascertain what is in the Government's mind. This provision is sloppiness, it is weakness, and it is dictatorial. It means simply that we do not need to spell anything out; we just write in the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"any such other purposes as the Secretary of State may by order specify."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making very heavy and sinister weather of this. If he puts himself back to the beginning of the clause he will find that money is made available only at the request of a trade union.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to follow the hon. Gentleman down that path. My difficulty is that, if I do, you may take the view, Mr. Goodhew, that we should not have a clause stand part debate. The hon. Gentleman is touching upon the heart of clause I, and I shall hope to catch your eye on clause stand part, when I shall wish to go down the road that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned. If for no other reason but that, I would rather decline the invitation to go down that path at the moment and return to it later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I want to impress upon the Committee, and particularly on the Government, is the serious danger of putting blanket powers in the hands of any Secretary of State. It is the duty of Parliament to go through legislation to ascertain what the Government are seeking to put on the statute book and to amend it where necessary. I suggest that I am right to make heavy weather of this. I am right to be alarmed about it because, as I said on the earlier amendment, what we must never forget in this Committee is that sitting on our shoulders are the law courts and we have too often Suffered from different or strange interpretations that the courts have put upon legislation which we have passed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Political interpretations also.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says political interpretations, too. That is always a cause of controversy. Mr. Speaker had something to say about that in the Chamber yesterday. What I suggest is that worse even than sloppy and badly drafted legislation of this nature is that danger which we must take account of—that our legislation may well be interpreted differently by the courts. I trust that the Under-Secretary will return to this and tell us that he is prepared to acknowledge our fears and amend lines 15 and 16, if not to withdraw them altogether on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) the compliment of accepting that he genuinely experiences these fears, but I must do my best to dispel them and I find the first task rather difficult. What does this amount to? What is being sought here is the power for the Secretary of State to come before Parliament and Say "Please approve by the affirmative procedure this 	<i>draft order</i> by which I seek to add to the category of ballots for which unions, if they wish, may be reimbursed the expense". If the hon. Gentleman sees dictatorship there, I wonder what he would do if he were to experience a real dictatorship. It is rather equivalent to a Government Saying "Here is provision for a free hot dinner" and then being confronted with ostensible fears that they are really paving the way for forced feedings. If that really is the kind of fear to which the hon. Gentleman is prey, I doubt that any rational argument can dispel it.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. I have been reminded that the CBI asked that wage offers—questions arising out of major wage Offers—should be brought within the scope of subsection (3). We came to the conclusion that that was not desirable, but that is not to say that we may not be persuaded to change our minds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that were the case and we were persuaded by trade unions that even the trade union to which the hon. Gentleman belongs that something else should be brought within the scope of the subsection, is it to be said that we must come before Parliament with legislation amending the main Act? Is it not more sensible to be able to say "We think this is right; here are the reasons; here is the draft order; we lay it before Parliament and we ask Parliament to approve it by the affirmative procedure."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman will accept that if he comes before Parliament and presents an order which he has produced at the behest of the trade unions, there will be
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
very little chance of opposition from this side, although the chances are that there would be considerable opposition from the Benches behind him. What we are worried about is not legislation emanating from the trade union side but legislation emanating from other sources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman ought to address himself to the merits of the argument. I have explained the purpose of this wording. At the end of the day, it is much more convenient, tidier, quicker and more efficient, and it can offer no danger at all. Any subsequent legislation on mandatory ballots Such as the Opposition purport to fear would certainly get no help from this clause. This clause has no bearing on the issue of whether at a later stage any Government might wish to introduce the power to have mandatory ballots. I do not think that I can help the Committee further, and I invite my hon. Friends to vote against the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg the hon. and learned Gentleman not to assume that we are making synthetic arguments and indulging in bogus fears. May I just put a possible hypothesis to the hon. and learned Gentleman? He and the Secretary of State will know that in many industries there has in past years been a disruption of good industrial relations by attempts to form breakaway organisations which have tended to be harmful to industrial relations. I could instance a number.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My previous occupation was as a toolmaker, and I was a member of the AUEW, as I have made clear on more than one occasion. I can remember the National Association of Toolmakers in the engineering industry and the harmful effect that that breakaway had on industrial relations. Those who know the railway industry will be well aware of an organisation that sought to recruit signalmen in former years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are provisions within the Bill, which we shall be discussing later, which could well encourage that kind of breakaway grouping and fragmentation of collective bargaining. For argument's sake, there may be one of these tiny splinter organisations, fostered and encouraged by a number of provisions of the bill, that may feel that it has fertile ground for recruitment among the members of the existing unions, in the railways, the min-

ing industry and so on, if it could only get across its message to the members of the other union and could ballot them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not beyond the hounds of possibility that some future Secretary of State may be approached by such an organisation saying "We are more moderate and reasonable fellows than these chaps in the NUM or NUR. If we could only get across to the chaps what a good little outfit we are, we could become the big outfit. They would join us. But it costs money. You have the powers under Section 1(3) of the Employment Act. Will you introduce such an order as will enable us to do that?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention that as only one possible hypothesis. The Committee may feel inclined to dismiss it, but it is one of only</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Before the power is exercised and before we use this provision, we ought to consult some people who have some authority and of whose views we will take some account." It seems a very reasonable and modest request. If the Under-Secretary or the Secretary of State could give us an assurance on that point, I could perhaps dissuade my hon.
