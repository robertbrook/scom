PICKETING</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed</i>[<i>18 March</i>], No. 163, in page 13, line 38, after " work", insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"or a place of work either of other workers who are parties to the trade dispute or occupied or used by any person who is giving or is likely to give aid or support to an employer party to the trade dispute whether by way of trade, business relationships, arrangements for insurance against loss, or in any other manner whatsoever directly or indirectly."—[<i>Mr. Harold Walker.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are considering at the same time the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 165, in page 13, line 41, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"or (<i>c</i>) at or near the place of work of another person who is a member of the same trade union".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 167, in page 14, line 8, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"or place of work either of other workers who are parties to the dispute or occupied or used by any person who is giving or is likely to give aid or support to an employer party to the trade dispute whether by way of trade, business relationships, arrangements for insurance against loss, or in any other manner whatsoever, directly or indirectly".</p></blockquote></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are in difficulty due to the absence of the <i>Official Report</i> of our last sitting, when the Attorney-General addressed the Committee. It would have been particularly helpful to have that <i>Official Report</i> now. However, I am told that we expect it during the course of the morning, and I suppose that we must at this stage try to manage without it.<br><br>
I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary would convey my thanks to the Attorney-General for the lucid way in which he explained just why the Government do not know what they are talking about. I am sure that we had all hoped that the attendance of the Attorney-General at our last sitting would throw some shafts of light into the dark corners of clause 14. Alas, he failed to do so. The Attorney-General showed himself to be a master of the obscure. The clause remains as shrouded in uncertainties as ever it was, and the need for these amendments is as great as ever it was. It is a bad clause, but at least our amendments would make it somewhat more comprehensible.<br><br>
The Secretary of State had a rather different approach. Whenever he came across anything that he could not define, he simply said "We all know what it means". Perhaps he did, but I do not think everybody else does.<br><br>
The most important thing that the Secretary of State failed to define—in fact, positively refused to define, as did the Attorney-General—was the phrase "place of work". That is an extremely important phrase in the clause. The Attorney-General said that it was a matter that would have to be decided by the courts, although the Secretary of State had assured us, in his own explanatory note, that it was a phrase which
<br><blockquote><p>"for most workers … has an obvious meaning".</p></blockquote>
It seems strange that a term which has an obvious meaning to workers has no meaning, apparently, to the Government, and they will have to rely on the courts to tell them what it means. Whether the right hon. Gentleman thinks that workers have some flash of inspiration which is denied to Cabinet Ministers, I am not quite sure. The idea that the phrase has an obvious meaning was completely demolished by my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson).<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1367</span>
When I put a question at the end of the last sitting concerning the Rotherham works of BSC to the Attorney-General, about what was meant in that case by " place of work", he was able to offer only a foolish and unworthy smart-alec type of reply, which I thought particularly unfortunate. I had explained that the Rotherham works of the British Steel Corporation has many departments which are split into two groups, separated by a distance of about five miles. It is clear that in a case like that the phrase "place of work" is open to many interpretations. The Attorney-General was able to say only that, of course, people know where they worked yesterday, or words to that effect.<br><br>
But that does not answer the question. If a man normally goes to work through gate No. 9, it would be unlawful under clause 14 for him to picket at gate No. 10, although there may be only a few yards between them. So we get nowhere on the question of place of work by having the Attorney-General here. Also, as I have already said, the Secretary of State was completely at a loss.<br><br>
The Secretary of State got himself into an awful tangle when he was talking about initimidation. My my hon. Friend the Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Radice) had pointed out to him that intimidation is illegal and contrary to the criminal law. The Secretary of State then talked about something which he called intimidation which was short of unlawful intimidation. I accept that his confusion on that point was not entirely unprecedented. I remember someone else talking about lawful intimidation in the previous Parliament. But that does not necessarily excuse a Member of the present Government falling into the same confusion when trying to push an important piece of legislation through a Committee. Finally the Secretary of State was reduced to defining it as the "sharp use of words". I do not have the <i>Official Report</i> in front of me, but I made a note of it at the time. That is a strange definition, and I think that it reduces the Committee to the level of comic opera.<br><br>
When the Secretary of State talked about intimidation—which we all deplore—he was not speaking to this clause or to the amendment because there is nothing in the clause or the amendment which has anything to do with intimidation.<br><br>
One thing that the Attorney-General
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1368</span>
made clear, as did his predecessor before him, is that the law as it stands is adequate to deal with any question of intimidation or other illegal or criminal acts which arise out of picketing. It seems obvious that intimidation means threatening words or behaviour. Those are contrary to the Public Order Act already. Intimidation cannot in any way be dealt with by clause 14. This is worrying, because the Secretary of State spent so much time on it that it reveals at least what is in his mind when he talks about picketing. Clearly, he is thinking of unruly scenes of hundreds of people, with threatening and bullying. That is also what the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) was talking about, but, again, nothing whatever to do with this clause.<br><br>
It is extremely disturbing when the Secretary of State, speaking on a Bill which is of enormous significance, is so obviously confused about what the Bill is actually saying—or at least appearing to be confused, perhaps deliberately. At one stage, although he did not try to define picketing, he used the phrase "in the normal sense of the word". But what he was talking about is not normal picketing. What is normal is two or three, or perhaps half a dozen, people standing at a factory gate and peacefully trying to persuade other people not to go through it. That is what normal picketing is.<br><br>
If the Secretary of State, any hon. or right hon. Members opposite have any doubt that, I shall happily arrange for them to come to Rotherham this weekend, and I shall take them to visit the steel pickets. There they will find three or four, or perhaps five, people standing at a gate trying to persuade other people, particularly lorry drivers in their cabs, not to go through it. The kind of unruly scenes which have occurred in a number of places and which get all the publicity in the press are the exception. That is not normal picketing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Giles Radice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are unlawful anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, they are. What we are talking about in clause 14 is normal picketing. It is disgraceful that the Secretary of State, or the Government as a whole, should be using something which is quite irrelevant to this clause—the public fear of bullying and bad behaviour on picket lines—to impose unreasonable and intolerable restrictions on peaceful pickets. That is our great objection to the clause
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1238">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1369</span>
and the reason why we are attempting at least to improve it modestly by these amendments.<br><br>
The Secretary of State appears to think that violent picketing is more likely to be done by those who are described as secondary pickets than by primary pickets. I know of no evidence to support that view. People who are picketing at their own gates are more likely to become a bit more excitable than those picketing at someone else's gate. But, whatever the position, it is irrelevant to clause 14. It is most unfortunate that the Secretary of State should argue his case from a false premise. He is insulting the Committee's intelligence if he thinks that we shall be as confused as he is.<br><br>
There are other uncertainties in the clause to which I should draw attention—particularly the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"from which his work is administered"</p></blockquote>
relating to people covered by subsection (2). What is the place from which his work is administered, for example, in the case of a lorry driver who works for a large national concern—the national head office, the regional head office or the branch head office? It can be anything. That will be a matter for great contention in the courts, with another bonanza for the lawyers, no doubt.<br><br>
I draw attention to the inconsistency between clause 14 and the working paper. The Secretary of State says that the working paper does not refer to picketing. In your absence, Mr. Leadbitter, when Mr. Goodhew was in the Chair, we had something of a discussion on whether the working paper should be relevant in the debates on this clause. It was clearly understood and, indeed, ruled that this would be so. The Secretary of State nevertheless claims that picketing is not included in the working paper. But it refers to "any industrial action", which must, surely, include picketing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is about to discuss the difference between the clause and something else. It is important at this stage to keep to the amendment. If he pursues for too long the comparison of the clause with another situation or possible piece of legislation, he may well deprive himself of a clause stand part debate in which his comments whould have greater impact. I merely put that as a suggestion to him.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1370</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Leadbitter. I was really following the comments of the Secretary of State, which were apparently held to be in order. I was on the same subject. If you feel that I should leave it till clause stand part, I am happy to do so, but I want to get on the record now that there is total inconsistency between the provisions of clause 14 and those of the working paper, particularly in relation to first customers and first suppliers. That was the point I intended to reach, but I shall certainly defer those remarks until the clause stand part debate.<br><br>
There is little that I wish to add. Clearly, like the rest of the Bill, clause 14 is intended to place severe shackles on trade unions and trade unionists. For that reason, while we shall certainly oppose the clause as a whole, it is important at this stage to attempt to improve it a little, to make it slightly more tolerable and certainly to make it more comprehensible. At this stage, while the Secretary of State may claim that it has an obvious meaning, throughout the whole clause there are so many uncertainties and obscurities, despite the attendance of and supposed assistance from the Attorney-General, that it needs to be drastically amended before we can know what it means.</span></p>
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) is a little less than fair to the Attorney-General. Although he is right that the Attorney-General was undoubtedly confused—indeed, very confused—and heaped confusion upon obfuscation in some cases on particular points, the broad message which the right hon. and learned Gentleman gave us was startlingly clear to me.<br><br>
If I may interrupt myself, Mr. Leadbitter, I wonder whether, with your great knowledge of the procedures and usages of the House, you could tell me why it is that it is only Members who are learned in the law who are described as "learned" and not Members learned in other disciplines. If we had on our Committee the greatest physicist, historian or musicologist, or a senior wrangler, his learning in physics, in history, in music or in mathematics would not entitle him to be called "hon. and learned". The odd bits of learning that I have tried so hard to pick up not only do not entitle me to be referred to as "the hon. and learned Gentleman" but would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1239">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1371</span>
leave hon. Members completely in order if they referred to me as "the hon. and ignorant Member".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. and learned Friend give way? I just want to ask whether my hon. and learned Friend recognises that, although I might address him as such, the probability is that it would not go down in the <i>Official Report</i> that way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is so. Perhaps you might like to turn that point over in your mind, Mr. Leadbitter, and give us some guidance on it.<br><br>
I got the message from the Attorney-General very clearly, and it is this. The Government recognise fully the right of a worker to strike as long as the strike is a failure. They recognise fully the right of a worker on strike—or the right of other workers—to picket as long as the picketing is ineffective. That is what it all came down to in the end.<br><br>
When a man goes on strike, he makes a sacrifice. He sacrifices his wages and he suffers a loss. He creates a loss by upsetting the rhythm of his daily life for five days a week and the rhythm of his family's life. It is a not inconsiderable sacrifice, and a not inconsiderable loss. The only chance he has of getting anywhere towards the objective which he seeks in the industrial dispute is to cause a loss to his employer. Otherwise, there is no earthly reason why the employer should concede any more as a result of the industrial dispute than he was willing to concede before the dispute, and that obviously was not enough, or was not thought to be enough.<br><br>
Unless some damage can be done to the interests of the employer, the damage which the worker does to his own interests is a sacrifice in vain. Therefore, it is nonsense to say that a man has a right to strike as long as he cannot make it stick, and he has a right to picket as long as he cannot make it stick. That is not only nonsense; it is a piece of hypocrisy. It would be more honest for the Government to say that they want to prevent people from striking and from picketing altogether, because that is what it comes to in the end. The restrictions on picketing which it is sought by this clause to place upon workers in disputes, and others, are so grave that in the upshot they will create a situation in which a picket cannot be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1372</span>
effective, cannot exercise any influence over the course of the dispute, and therefore cannot exercise any influence over the mind of the employer. That is the message I got, loud and clear, from the Attorney-General, and now we all know where we stand.<br><br>
I want to refer to only one other thing that the right hon. and learned Gentleman talked about, and that was obstruction. He talked about it from the fastnesses of his great knowledge of the law. He manifestly did not talk about it from first-hand knowledge of going to see what happens in dispute situations and in picketing. For example, if a picket is standing still, he is "pinched" for causing obstruction only if the obstruction is a real one, namely, if he is preventing people who live in the same street from getting in and out of their houses, or to and from the bus stop, or into and out of the street corner grocery. An underground station may be in the street, and so on. So long as he is not obstructing in that real sense, he will not be apprehended for obstruction.<br><br>
I have seen with my own eyes many cases in which that is not the case. So long as an individual police officer can take his own <i>ipso dixit</i> decision about obstruction, immediately any man on a picket line is caught. I have seen a case in which six pickets were standing side by side outside the locked gate of a factory, and therefore off the pavement altogether. They were standing in a row quietly, five men and one woman, doing no more than holding placards and saying "Hello" to people walking by whom they happened to know. A policeman came along and took one of the six, the third one from the right as it happened, and pulled him in for obstruction, leaving the other five undisturbed and unmolested. He just picked out the one and pulled him in for obstruction. The only difference that I could see—there was certainly no difference in the posture, the attitude, the behaviour or the remarks of that picket from those of any of the other five—which perhaps occasioned that picket to be picked on was that he was black and all the others were white. I hate to think that that might be the case, but there was nothing else to distinguish him from the other five.<br><br>
I have seen many other cases in which pickets have been pulled in for obstruction where no reasonable person would have said that they were in any way interfering with the movement of citizens going about their lawful business in the way described
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1240">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1373</span>
by the Attorney-General, that is, going into and out of their houses and so on. I repeat that I have seen many such cases.<br><br>
It may be said that in the end the charge of obstruction has to be proved in a court. Again—I say this with regret—that does not help us much. So long as courts will in nine cases out of 10 take the uncorroborated word of any policeman against the uncorroborated word of any civilian—which is undoubtedly the case, as records show—the courts does not provide protection against arbitrary and unjustified apprehension of a picket for obstruction. And so long as a court, seven times out of 10, will take the uncorroborated word of a policeman against the corroborated word of a civilian, the court provides no defence against arbitrary apprehension for pickets.<br><br>
If anyone doubts my figures, it is easy enough to obtain the records. One has only to look at the outcome of what happened at Southall—true, not an industrial situation but of a different sort—where 70 per cent. of the people who were apprehended by the police were convicted on police evidence alone, uncorroborated. The policeman who killed Blair Peach still goes not merely untried but uncharged. So we do not, in real life, delude ourselves into believing that the court is a protection against arbitrary action by the police on a picket line.<br><br>
Therefore, what the Attorney-General said about pickets being all right, and even being allowed to stand still—what a great triumph for British civil liberty that a man is allowed to stand still—provided that they do not stop people going about their lawful business, is absolutely meaningless in real life, as anyone knows who has ever stood on a picket line.<br><br>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham, that we did not get any help from the Attorney-General, except the help of having the Government's mind made absolutely clear to us. Their commitment to people's right to strike is false and hypocritical. Their commitment to people's right to picket is false and hypocritical. They will permit people to go through the motions of picketing, but as soon as there is any possibility that that picketing may have an effect to the benefit of the worker in his dispute, they come down on it like a ton of bricks. At least now we know where we are.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, the Committee's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1374</span>
attention should be drawn to the fact that we do not have copies of the <i>Official Report</i> of our last sitting. It would have been of great help to the Committee if we could have read the statement from the learned Attorney-General so that we could grasp what he was trying to tell the Committee. As a consequence, we enter these proceedings in some dubiety as to what he meant when he used certain phrases. For example, he said on one occasion that the purpose of the clause was to restore rights that employers used to have. I should have been very interested to go through that speech, had it been presented to us in printed form, to find out what he actually meant by that. I do not know under which Acts employers had certain rights and how those rights have been eroded over the years.<br><br>
When the Secretary of State spoke against the amendments, he made much of the fact that he is backed by public opinion in presenting the Bill and this clause. We heard that tale in 1971, when we were told that the Industrial Relations Act was a result of tremendous public pressure to cut the trade unions down to size. We all know how that ended. It ended with the director-general of the CBI appearing on television prior to the general election, saying that the legislation had been a failure. It was disastrous in its consequences.<br><br>
A pledge was given by the Conservative Party, with hand on heart, that it would not introduce similar legislation. But it seems that we are getting it by instalments. This is the first instalment. Later on there may be another Bill to reduce security benefits for strikers' families. So we are getting the Industrial Relations Act back again in instalments.<br><br>
Obviously, if public opinion polls are taken and people are asked whether they are in favour of strikes, they will answer "No". They will always be prepared to support any measures to reduce strikes, because strikes inconvenience us all to a greater or less degree—except perhaps a strike by the Inland Revenue staff or, dare I say, by Members of Parliament. There are few strikes that have no impact on the public. It is natural for them to hope that a climate can be created in which there are fewer strikes, or none at all.<br><br>
11 a.m.<br><br>
It is rather like asking people if they are for or against sin, although in this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1241">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1375</span>
permissive age those in favour of sin might be a quite formidable minority. Nevertheless, the Government will realise in the course of time that they are not backed by public opinion.<br><br>
I hoped that when the Attorney-General addressed the Committee he would have set the law on picketing in its historical context. According to the Webbs' "History of Trade Unionism", published as long ago as 1920, picketing had taken place at least 100 years before then, that is, very soon after the Combination Acts, which first made the trade unions legal. So it has a very long history. By and large, picketing has been peaceful and has remained an essential feature of trade union activity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member recall that in that book the Webbs said that with the advent of modern means of communication, among other things, picketing was becoming a thing of the past?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intend to refer to that point. I shall do so immediately. The Conservative manifesto—the Secretary of State referred to it in his speech—states that the growth of such secondary picketing is due to easier transport and communications. The hon. and learned Gentleman may like to know that secondary picketing took place many years ago. I could cite three or four examples. Perhaps one will suffice.<br><br>
When there was a strike in 1899 in the Durham coalfield, the employers recruited Irish labourers to come to the Durham coalfield to take the place of the miners who were on strike. The miners' union picketed the railway stations in the vicinity. They picketed the ports and the places of entry in order to try to persuade the Irish labourers not to do the jobs of those on strike. That was in an age when the motor car did not exist, and working people walked 60, 80 or 100 miles to the nearest port or railway station for the purpose of picketing and persuading Irish labourers who had been shipped over by the employers not to do the work of those on strike.<br><br>
That is one example—and there are many others—of men walking for miles in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1376</span>
order to picket. Although communication was difficult, secondary picketing has existed for many years. It has become easier, of course, with the growth of our transport undertakings.<br><br>
Those were clearly not flying pickets. It may have taken them two or three days to walk to the nearest port to interview those people. There is a long record of workers engaging in secondary picketing when communications were not as fast as they are today. I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman is not trying to make the case that it has occurred only in the last few years when the motor car has enabled people to travel quickly It has existed throughout the history of the trade union movement. The Webbs made that clear in their book. Indeed, the atmosphere that has been created by picketing has changed little over the years.<br><br>
May I read now to the Committee an extract from a book by a trade union leader. While I read it, hon. Members may care to try to think of the name of the trade union leader who wrote it. It reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"Hundreds of strikes, with the usual practice of picketing, occur, to which public attention is never drawn; they are not of sufficient importance to attract a crowd of reporters anxious to chronicle every fact which tells against the workmen. Such strikes sometimes result in favour of the men, at other times in favour of the masters; picketing is resorted to in most cases, but the public hear nothing about the alleged evils of the system. Why? Because they seldom take place. But let one single instance of coercion or undue influence be resorted to, and the entire newspaper press will record the fact, not infrequently colouring it so as to distort its real nature and significance."</p></blockquote>
That was not written by Arthur Scargill. It did not appear in <i>Labour Weekly</i> or <i>Tribune.</i> It appeared in a book called " Conflicts of Capital and Labour", published by Macmillan in 1890. So the leopard has not changed his spots. Today, as almost 100 years ago, the newspapers magnify every tiny incident on the picket line to grotesque proportions, yet at the same time they overlook the fact that, by and large, picketing is carried on by peaceful means.<br><br>
The Tories endeavour to carry on their great tradition of vilification, claiming to base it on the references in their manifesto to
<br><blockquote><p>"an increasing use of intimidation on picket lines, whether directly through the threat of physical violence or indirectly through the threat of loss of union membership, and, as a consequence, of jobs".</p></blockquote>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1377</span>
That has been the cry of everyone who tries to restrict the activities of the trade unions in protecting the interests of their members—the idea that they are antisocial and violent, when very little evidence is brought forward to prove the case. If one looks at recent trade union activities, one can see very few cases of violence. They can be dealt with, when violence does occur, within the existing law.<br><br>
I hoped that when the Attorney-General was with us he would give us some background information as to the evolution of the law on picketing. It was first referred to in the 1875 Act which set out various proposals for containing violence. This was the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875. There are many sections of that Act still in force today. The Act specifies as illegal five specific things if they are done to compel someone to do, or to abstain from doing, anything lawful—that is, if he (i) uses violence to, or intimidates such other person, his wife or children, or injures his property; (ii) persisently follows him; (iii) hides his tools or other property, or deprives him of them, or hinders their use; (iv) watches or besets any house or place where he is or any approach to it; (v) follows him in the street with two or more others in a disorderly manner.<br><br>
Those crimes are applicable to all picketing, irrespective of whether there is a trade dispute. The Act, however, sought to legalise peaceful picketing and to make a distinction between the criminal law and picketing. There was a proviso in that Act which deemed that attending at or near a place merely in order to obtain or communicate information was legal.<br><br>
Those were the first rights that the trade unions had to conduct peaceful picketing. After that, the judges got their teeth into it and began to emasculate the Act. As a result, in 1906 we had the notorious Taff Vale judgment in which the Associated Society of Railway Servants was heavily fined as a consequence of an industrial dispute. The situation created by the 1906 judgment caused such a stir in the country—the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) may be interested in this—that it brought about a landslide for the Liberal Party. It gave birth to the Labour Party, which, for the first time, got a substantial number of Members of Parliament. There was tremendous outrage at that method of crippling the trade union movement, and as a consequence the 1906 Act was passed.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1378</span>
The 1906 Act went a little further than the 1875 Act in the sense that it said that people could be persuaded not to pass a picket line. Since 1906, this has been the prevailing law. The hon. and learned Gentleman has to prove to the Committee and to the country that there is any necessity for a change in that law. The only necessity that one could see would be the incidence of undue violence, requiring a tightening of the law. But it has worked perfectly in this country. Indeed, our laws on picketing are the envy of the rest of the world.<br><br>
In the United States, for example, on many picket lines pickets are caught or shot by hired killers, hired by employers for the purpose of using physical violence against pickets. There was a case in Italy a few months ago where tear gas was used against pickets. During the strike in the steel areas in France, where trade unions were protesting aginst the closure of factories in the steel industry, troops had to be called out and riot squads sent into the area to deal with that type of picketing. The trade union movement in this country, generally pickets peacefully. If there is undue violence on the picket lines, it is dealt with satisfactorily under the existing law, without the need for any amendment.<br><br>
If one looks what is said by authorities which have particular and specialist knowledge of the trade union movement, one can see that this tightening of the law has not been recommended by many. For example, Donovan twice says that picketing is peaceful and that there should be no alteration in the law. The law on picketing has been in existence since 1906, and according to Donovan there should be no change. Paragraph 855 of the Donovan report states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where a strike occurs it is obviously in the interests of the strikers to dissuade, if they can, other workmen from replacing them and customers of the employer from dealing with him while the strike continues. This involves that such other workmen and such customers must know that a strike is taking place and the men's side of the case."</p></blockquote>
A little later in the report Donovan, dealing with secondary picketing, acknowledged the frequency of persuasion of customers—it might have added employers—and found, in paragraph 875, that
<br><blockquote><p>"most persons … regard it as legitimate. In our opinion "—</p></blockquote>
the law—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1243">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1379</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"should be amplified so as to make such peaceful persuasion lawful."</p></blockquote>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
In effect, Donovan is asking for an extension of the law on picketing, for example, to allow lorries and cars conveying workers to be stopped so that pickets can peacefully endeavour to persuade the occupants of the lorries and cars not to go into a particular factory where there is an industrial dispute. It seems to us that the case has yet to be made out for a change in the law. By our amendment we seek directly to contradict the view that this clause, which is the heart of the Bill, should be enshrined in our legislation.<br><br>
During the debates on the Bill in 1971, I prophesied that within a short time the proposals in that Bill would be discarded in the dustbin of history. I believe that the Government are setting themselves an impossible task if they think that the proposals in the present clause can be enforced.<br><br>
Questions have already been raised about how one is to ascertain the names of the pickets and where they work. Is this to be a task for the police? Much of the legislation on trade union matters at the moment seems to depend to a great extent on the attitude of the police. In many instances the police are co-operative. I know of instances I have been on picket lines many times—where police have stopped cars and lorries going into factories to enable the pickets to talk to the occupants or drivers of the vehicles. In other instances the police adopt an authoritative manner, pushing the pickets around, telling them to get on to the pavement, arresting them on trivial charges of obstruction when they refuse to comply immediately with the demands of the police.<br><br>
We must get back to basics, and those basics are that if a strike breaks out the trade unions will use all the methods that they possibly can that are legal—and that have been legal from 1875 until the present day—to sustain their point of view. It seems to me that the hon. and learned Gentleman and his Government will get into the greatest possible difficulties if they bring the law into disrepute, as, in my view, they are doing here.<br><br>
What would happen, for example, if we had a repetition of the episode
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1380</span>
during the miners' strike when 20,000 people turned up outside the Saltley coke works to stop lorries entering the premises? The police took a very courageous stand on that occasion; they closed the doors and they would not allow the lorries to enter that establishment.<br><br>
But one can foresee a situation where the unions become aggresive because they are surrounded by restrictions. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) said, this clause is designed to allow people to strike and to allow them to picket provided that the strike and the pickets are ineffective. That is its purpose. Its purpose is to deprive the trade unions of the rights that they have had for well over a century and to substitute a form of words which will make it more difficult for them to take industrial action and to be successful in that action.<br><br>
I hope, therefore, that our amendment, which is directly aimed at the heart of the clause, will be carried. If it is not, and if the clause is enshrined in the Act, one can foresee confrontation and an increase in aggravation within the trade union movement. This will be bad not only for the country but also for industrial relations in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eric G. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it would be right if I addressed some questions to the Under-Secretary before he replies. That may save a little time.<br><br>
I share the view expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) that we are in some difficulty in not having the <i>Hansard</i> for Tuesday afternoon's sitting when the Secretary of State and the Attorney-General addressed the Committee. That sentiment has been echoed by all who have spoken this morning. I make no complaint about the Official Reporters or the <i>Hansard</i> organisation. They must be labouring under great difficulties, because the Government have got themselves into an awful legislative mess and tangle, and the work load on those people must be tremendous.<br><br>
If you had been with us on Tuesday, Mr. Leadbitter, you would have heard the Secretary of State and the Attorney-General address the Committee in very broad terms. That is in no way a reflection on them—some of the things that they said were helpful—or, of course, on Mr. Goodhew, and it was of some assistance to the Committee. The Secretary of State
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1244">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1381</span>
makes infrequent visits to us, but when he does address the Committee he usually makes something close to a Second Reading speech and then departs. He has other duties, and I do not complain about that. If he is in some other quarter fighting the extremists who have taken over the Tory Party, we do not mind that, either. But he comes here and occasionally gets away with murder.<br><br>
When the Attorney-General addressed us, he sought to anticipate some of the questions that we should be raising, so he went even further than the amendments under discussion, but I shall try to confine myself to the amendments. In any event, I suspect that the Under-Secretary, whom we look forward to hearing on this subject, knows as much about the issues as either the Attorney-General or the Solicitor-General does. I know that we are to have the pleasure of hearing the Solicitor-General this afternoon—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Are we?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that that is so. I think that the Solicitor-General is coming this afternoon to give us the benefit of his advice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that it is the same.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I intervene for a moment? I have been discussing the position as it has been developing since the Attorney-General came to the last sitting, and I have looked at the range of amendments. I suggest to the Committee that on the amendments alone the Chair is in some difficulty in allowing a stand part debate. It is possible—I put it no higher—that I may be placed in that situation.<br><br>
At this stage, I am seeking to advise both sides of the Committee of what is in my mind. While the right hon. Gentleman who leads for the Opposition is speaking, I think—recognising what he has already said and indicated—that I should make known that the Chair will not object to the continuation of a wide-ranging debate on the amendments so that those leading for both sides may make what would normally be their clause stand part speeches.<br><br>
If that is agreeable to the Committee, it will be easier for the Chair to accept a consensus from the Committee, recognising that I would invoke Standing Order No. 48 and not have a stand part debate. As long as the Committee knows what is in the mind of the Chair, it can now proceed.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1382</span>
I have already apologised to the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther), because I had advised him that he should make his speech on clause stand part. I have corrected that. There are sufficient amendments now for the Committee, with its eye on the clock and the business before us, to proceed in such a way that it will not be disappointed if I invoke Standing Order No. 48.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful for your thoughts, Mr. Leadbitter, though we hope at this stage that they are your interim thoughts, if I may put it that way, because many of my hon. Friends will want to reflect on what you have said. While you were engaged in consultation, I was pointing out that both the Secretary of State and the Attorney-General had broadened the debate. It was no part of our intention that the debate should be broadened in that way. In fact, my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker), who presented this first group of amendments, maintained strict observance of the rules governing the conduct of Committees and did not stray at all, and I think that he was rather surprised at the Secretary of State's speech. Perhaps I may consider the matter further and at some stage make representations to you while we are considering the amendments.<br><br>
The Secretary of State made a broad speech. As I say, on occasion he gets away with murder. At one stage, he implied that there had been an increase in violence on picket lines. That contention is not supported by any evidence at all. If it needs to be made plain, I want to make plain now that no one on the Opposition Benches is in favour of violence on picket lines or anywhere else. We go out of our way on every occasion to say that picketing should be peaceful and that it should be maintained in that spirit.<br><br>
Three issues arise out of the amendments. The first is the justification for confining pickets to their own workplace. Why do the Government want to do that? What is their main purpose? The second issue is the question of the limit on picketing, not only where there is a lawful picket, if I may use that expression, but where it would become unlawful if the provision in the clause reaches the statute book. Third, there is the question of those who will have the responsibility for monitoring these activities, whether it be the police or some
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1245">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1383</span>
other agency. I shall deal with the three issues in turn, and perhaps the Under-Secretary will reply.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher) drew attention to the Donovan report and quoted from it. I shall do the same, particularly from paragraph 856 of that valuable report:
<br><blockquote><p>"In the atmosphere engendered by a strike, … men who are enduring the privations which may accompany it would hardly be human if they viewed with composure the spectacle of other workmen endeavouring to take over their jobs."</p></blockquote>
That sums up the matter. Where there are people on strike who want to prosecute that strike to ultimate success, if their work is being transferred to another factory they want to have some influence on that other factory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has my right hon. Friend seen a report in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> today which underlines what he has just said? It is by one of the newspaper's political staff, Mr. Comfort. Mr. Comfort begins by saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"Supporters of the ' step by step ' approach to trade union reform adopted by Mr. Prior, Employment Secretary, are concerned that the expected action to curb social security payments to strikers' families will undermine the Government's chances of making its trade union legislation stick.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"They fear that the victory ' won by Mr. Prior in Cabinet last month when he resisted pressure from the Prime Minister and others for immediate action against such practices as secondary picketing has turned out to be a hollow one because of decisions taken in other quarters."</p></blockquote>
The report goes on to talk about apprehension over the proposal to cut £12 a week from benefits. These are the benefits to strikers' families. That newspaper report underlines my right hon. Friend's comments. In that situation, the tensions will be even higher than hitherto.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has underlined the great fear of many Opposition members of the Committee, because we never seem to have a definitive proposal from the Government on how they will deal with this matter. The Government come forward with working papers and we think that the legislation which will arise from the working papers is their final word. True, they hoist a few question marks about whether it may be necessary to go even further, but we know now that further amendments will be made to the Bill and that there is to be a Green Paper—
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1384</span>
I suppose, towards the middle of the year—and perhaps further legislation next year.<br><br>
While some people like to describe these proposals as a "softly, softly" approach by the Secretary of State, in no sense are they "softly, softly". In clause 14 they are most severe and could land the Government and the country into the same difficulties as they experienced with the legislation which they put on the statute book in 1971. I suspect that the Under-Secretary is as worried as anybody else about the pitfalls we might get into as a result of this legislation and how far it is going. At some stage we must say that we have got the legislation and should see how far it goes.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
I know that the Secretary of State has reservations about it, because on nearly every occasion when he makes a speech outside the House of Commons he qualifies the message, saying that one cannot rely exclusively on the law to improve industrial relations. That will be the difficulty for the Government. Internal feuding is taking place. People are fighting rearguard actions. This salami tactic, this "drip feed" attitude—call it what one may—will create major difficulties for the trade unions and will injure industrial relations. Only time will tell.<br><br>
I suppose that the Government will get their legislation on the statute book, and that is when the real horror will take place for those members of the Conservative Party who know that it will not improve industrial relations. We shall come to even further measures, and then—who knows?—by that time the Secretary of State may have resigned or gone to another less sensitive post within the Government.<br><br>
Donovan said that one could not expect men to stand idly by if their work was being transferred to other places. Of course, they will not. Even if this legislation is put on the statute book, they will seek to take some action to restrain it. The Attorney-General said that strikers could get on the telephone to their colleagues in another factory asking them to black work received from the factory where there was the strike. A picket need not be mounted, in that sense. There are other methods. But it does not always work out as easily as that. We could give dozens of examples where workers would want to take action to persuade other
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1246">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1385</span>
workers to give up work which had been taken over and to take action in the form of blacking.<br><br>
In the public sector one can certainly think of examples, such as British Leyland. If workers go on strike at Longbridge and some of their work is transferred to Cowley, under this legislation the Long-bridge workers will be prevented from going to Cowley and mounting a picket. There is the question of the CBI's strike fund. The Confederation of British Industry is getting together massive sums of money, if the press reports are anything to go by. It will use that money to compensate a firm which is in dispute.<br><br>
Is it legitimate for workers at a firm in dispute to go to a company contributing to the CBI's strike fund? Under this legislation it would not be, but, as I have said on previous occasions in the Committee, there is no restriction on the employers organising themselves to defeat a strike. It is legitimate for them to do it, but now it will not be legitimate for the trade unions to take action to support their strike in that way.<br><br>
There is the current dispute within the British Steel Corporation—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend makes an important point when he refers to the CBI's proposed strike fund, because it has a considerable bearing on the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) about the Government's proposal to deem that strikers are receiving £12 a week from their union and knocking it off their benefit. My right hon. Friend may care to ponder whether, in the event of a company in a dispute receiving money from a strike fund, the Government will take the view that it should be taxed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want particularly to get into that. I suspect that next Wednesday the Chancellor of the Exchequer will announce something similar to what my hon. Friends have raised here, and we shall be able to express our views in the four-day debate on the Budget Statement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my right hon. Friend aware that if the Chancellor introduces legislation on those lines, it will not save much money? Is he aware that, during the lifetime of the Labour Government, 81 per cent. of all strikes, official and unofficial, ended within 12 working days and that no
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1386</span>
supplementary benefits whatever were involved? If that is carried forward, which undoubtedly it will be, the savings to the Government will be very minor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In terms of public expenditure, the support for strikers' families—not strikers—is tiny. Public expenditure is about £75 billion, and in those terms the support that the taxpayer gives to strikers' families is infinitesimal. But it is typical of the sort of action that the Government are taking—their mean-minded arrangements and the spiteful way in which they want to deal with trade unionists' families. They are going back on what the Secretary of State for Industry said, when he was Secretary of State for Social Services, to the Conservative Party conference. But, no doubt, we shall return to that next week when these matters come before the House of Commons arising out of the Budget Statement.<br><br>
There is another aspect the denial of the right of trade unionists to seek to get other trade unionists to support their strike. That is what the clause means. I was about to draw to the Committee's attention the difficulties in the present strike in the British Steel Corporation. For example, the CBI, in addition to its anti-strike fund, has organised a "swap shop". It has a list of steel stockists and can put its members in touch with steel suppliers. It can transfer steel from one factory to another. Clearly, that undermines the strike at the British Steel Corporation and the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation.<br><br>
Under this legislation it would not be possible for trade unionists to take action or try to persuade workers to support them. In fact, during the present dispute the British Steel Corporation is actually advising its former customers where they can get supplies overseas. Its marketing department is still in operation and it is telling any past customer that there is a parcel of steel in some country or other—perhaps on the Continent—and how to get it.<br><br>
If the steel workers in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther)wanted to come down to the British Steel Corporation and mount a picket outside its headquarters, under this legislation they would be forbidden to do so. They could not come. Certainly, some trade unionists—not necessarily ISTC members—are in that marketing department of the British Steel Corporation.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1247">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1387</span>
There are examples in British shipbuilding. For example, if there were a dispute in the Govan yard in Scotland and the work was transferred to a yard in Sunderland, the Govan workers could not go down there to persuade workers, some of whom are their fellow-members, to take action to support them. There are endless examples, of course, in the private sector. Among the large companies, GKN springs to mind, and Tube Investments, where they switch the work around, probably unbeknown to the people on strike, and no action could be taken against that. I do not know what the justification is for this, except that stated by my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo), namely, that it is all right to strike and it is all right to picket provided that the actions are non-effective.<br><br>
The phrase about "licensed" pickets seems to have come into our vocabulary, and "primary dispute", which refers to people who may join a licensed picket. In the working papers which came out in July, I do not think the Government originally evisaged that a trade union official should be allowed to join a picket line, that is, a proper picket. I am not certain about that. No doubt, the hon. and learned Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong. But we know from the Bill that a trade union official may join a licensed or proper picket if he is accompanied by a worker. The Government naturally realise the value of this provision, because usually, if they want to avoid violence, if they want good order, it is best to have somebody in authority there who can organise and conduct the action properly.<br><br>
There are other amendments to the clause which we shall reach later, to be moved by my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker). I shall not use the example of Members of Parliament. Let me say instead that secretaries of trades councils could not go down to a picket line and express solidarity, and neither could a trade unionist from another factory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A person would not be able to pop along to tell them there was a cup of tea waiting for them down the road.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is an area not yet touched on by the Committee and I ask my right hon. Friend to dwell on it for a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1388</span>
moment. I am sure that he is aware that a number of disputes occur in which women workers strike for equal pay. They set up a picket and are often joined on the picket lines by women who are not particularly bothered about the dispute at the works but who are expressing solidarity for the principle of equal pay for women. Often, the women who join the workers on the picket line are not workers at all but housewives who come along and recognise the struggle for women's rights.<br><br>
Under the terms of the Bill, that action would be outlawed and housewives would find themselves liable to an injunction taken out against them by the employer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We could give all kinds of examples. My final comment at this stage concerns identification. My hon. Friend has just reminded us that action against un authorised pickets would have to be taken by an employer. But these people have to be identified. On Tuesday afternoon the Attorney-General said that it would not be the task of the police. I wonder about this. On Second Reading I expressed reservations. I thought that the police would inevitably be drawn into the matter more and more as this legislation went into force.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary told us in the debate on clause 2 that the code which the Government are to produce will act as a guide to the police. Inevitably, therefore, in these highly-charged sensitive situations the police will go to a licensed picket in a primary dispute and ask "Do you work here?" The police may then say that the worker is causing an obstruction which makes it a criminal offence and that he had better move off.<br><br>
The Attorney-General said that that would not be so, that he did not expect the police to be involved in that way. I understand why the right hon. Gentleman said that. The police chiefs, who saw the Home Secretary a few weeks ago, told him that they did not want to become involved in this matter. The police certainly do not want to become involved in the numbers game. Mr. Goodson, who spoke on behalf of the chief constables, is quoted as saying that
<br><blockquote><p>"He ruled out as impractical any new legislation laying down a precise limit on the number of people who can constitute a peaceful picket."</p></blockquote>
I can understand why he wants to do that, because it would make their task even harder.<br><br>

Coming back to the question of those who would join a picket line, and who under this legislation would not be permitted to be there, who would take action in such cases? My hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) has said that it would be the employer's responsibility to take action against them. But what about the matter of identification? If the police are not to be involved, how will it be done? The Attorney-General said that if a picket was a well-known character it would be clear for everybody to see. But there must be some kind of identification if action is to be taken.<br><br>
We heard about the use of cinematograph processors. I once said in a previous discussion in this Committee that whoever loses out when the Conservatives introduce industrial relations legislation, the lawyers always win. It appears that on this occasion the people who use cinematograph equipment will also win. That will be a new growth industry, as far as Tory industrial legislation is concerned.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Grunwick!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. They will take pictures and then somebody will have to identify them. This is a great mess as far as we are concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Assuming that the police can identify the people, that they are picked out and the employer applies for an injunction and then decides to pursue the matter further and actually asks for damages, how on earth are the courts to apportion the blame between the various people who have been picked out by the police in the first instance? That will be an awful mess and it will certainly be a new growth industry for the learned members of my profession.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Under-Secretary will answer my hon. and learned Friend's point when he replies. I give all these examples to demonstrate how this legislation will cause a further deterioration in industrial relations. It will not assist industrial relations one little bit. There are certain provisions of the Bill that can, I suppose, be coped with, but when it comes to this—the central part of it—I think that the Government are storing up for themselves a great deal of trouble.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was my original intention to speak briefly and specifically to the amendment so admirably moved by my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker), but in view of your ruling—which of course I accept, Mr. Leadbitter I will broaden my arguments just a little. Could I place on record a protest about the way that the Committee operated on Tuesday afternoon? I am not in any way criticising the Chairman on that occasion but when the Secretary of State comes along—and we understand that his visit to the Committee can only be fleeting because of the nature of his duties—it really is not fair for him to do so with a prepared line of Aunt Sallys which nobody else has raised, and to spend half an hour on a prepared speech knocking down these Aunt Sallys. He did not in any way reply to the arguments put forward by my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster in the amendments that are now being discussed.<br><br>
During the course of the Attorney-General's presentation to the Committee, there were one or two areas where he seemed to be contradicting somewhat—or certainly not agreeing entirely with—the views expressed by the Secretary of State in his general Second Reading-type deliberations on clause 14. Our difficulties are compounded by the fact that we do not have the printed <i>Official Report</i> of the proceedings, and therefore we are not in a position to compare the submissions of the Secretary of State with those of the Attorney-General.<br><br>
During the course of the Secretary of State's presentation, he made absolutely clear that all secondary picketing would be outlawed. That was the general thrust of his argument. No matter what the logicality or justification for secondary picketing—and we attempted to put certain examples to him which would fully justify secondary picketing, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher) made clear, has gone on for a very long time—he did not listen to the arguments. He replied only that secondary picketing will be made illegal.<br><br>
The Secretary of State mentioned three major disputes: the mine workers' strike at the Saltley coke works, the winter of discontent last year and the current steel strike. We should ask what thread links those three disputes. The thread is that the workers involved, rightly or wrongly—and in my view rightly felt that they were
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1249">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1391</span>
not only taking on their employers but were also taking on the Government of the day. It is important, in reference to the winter of discontent, that we separate the various elements which made up that rather bitter period.<br><br>
One was the appalling winter. The second was the lorry drivers' strike. The third was the local authority workers' strike. There was no secondary picketing in the local authority workers' strike. Certain things happened during that strike which were not pleasant, and some of us disagreed with some of them, but there was no secondary picketing. Secondary picketing occurred only within the confines of the lorry drivers' strike and many harsh words were said at the time.<br><br>
The Secretary of State is very fond of quoting my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition, who was then the Prime Minister, without attempting to put the words into context. It is important to recall that at that time the Labour Government—and this was particularly true of my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley), the then Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection, and my right hon. Friend the Member for Stockton (Mr. Rodgers), the then Secretary of State for Transport—were making perfectly clear to the employers of the lorry drivers that if they gave way to the demands of the lorry drivers they would refer the whole question of the road haulage industry to the Price Commission.<br><br>
That stiffened the resolve of the employers and made perfectly clear to the lorry drivers that they were taking on the Government of the day as well as the employers. When my right hon. Friend's resolve collapsed and he announced that he would not refer any settlement to the Price Commission, the strike was settled within seven days.<br><br>
In the miners' dispute, we all know that the workers were taking on the Government of the day. No one would dispute that in the present steel workers' strike the steel workers are convinced that they are taking on not only the British Steel Corporation but Her Majesty's Government. It is in those situations that we have had the series of mass picketing which has created so much tension, aggravation and heartache in the many people who support the rights of workers to exercise their industrial muscle.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1392</span>
One of the things missing from clause 14 is any attempt to define how picketing workers deal with the question of lorries coming into the works. The Under-Secretary will recall, as will my right hon. Friend, that we spent many long hours in Committee on the Employment Protection Bill attempting to deal with the very vexed problem of picketing workers who seek peacefully to persuade lorry drivers not to enter their place of work with goods or services. We did not succeed. I recall my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) moving an amendment to the Employment Protection Bill on Report, to clarify the law. I should like to quote a few words used in that debate:
<br><blockquote><p>"I want to express what is possibly an heretical point of view, coming from someone who sits on the Opposition side of the House. I think that it is right that we should at least bring ourselves to consider whether we should not confer upon the police the right, in certain picketing situations, to stop a vehicle for a limited and reasonable time so that a picket may seek to persuade the driver. If this were the law, it would do away with the need for mass picketing."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 30 July 1975; Vol 896, c. 1903.]</p></blockquote>
I wonder if the Under-Secretary of State can remember those words. They were his words on the Report stage of the Employment Protection Act. Unfortunately, there is nothing in this Bill which seeks to solve the problem of picketing in relation to what was always a very grave problem.<br><br>
When workers on strike are picketing an establishment, when lorries are coming in and out of the gates, they have the right peacefully to persuade. The Under-Secretary knows full well they have no legal right to stop a lorry. The problem has never been solved as to how a picket can stop a 30-ton lorry thundering by at 30 miles an hour in order to persuade the driver that the strike is just and legitimate. There is no attempt in this clause to solve that problem. It is important that the Under-Secretary should say a few words about that.<br><br>
The Secretary of State, in answer to questions when certain situations were posed, where we suggested that the workers would have a legitimate right to secondary picket—I will not repeat all the words relating to the ship-repair situation, where a ship was transferred from one yard to another; the Under-Secretary heard me and he can, therefore, reply to me—suggested that they could use the telephone. That shows the complete and utter
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1250">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1393</span>
lack of knowledge of the Secretary of State as to how workers react to situations like that, as if workers will walk calmly out of their shipyard and simply pick the telephone up and phone down the river and say " By the way, our work is on its way down. We would be grateful if you would think about doing it."<br><br>
The normal set of circumstances is that the convenor at the first, yard would use the telephone to tell the convenor at the second yard that he and his shop stewards' committee were on their way down and they wanted to address the shop stewards at that yard. The procedure would be then that the shop stewards would have a discussion about the situation. Probably a mass meeting of workers would be called, and the second yard and the convenor from the first yard would address the workers as to the cause of the dispute. Then, in all probability, the ship would almost certainly be blacked. That is the reality of the situation.<br><br>
Under the terms of this Bill as drafted, if the workers at the first yard sought to take any action in the way outlined just now, through their shop stewards visiting the second yard, they would be liable to have an injunction slapped on them by the second employer to prevent them actually going to that works to put across their point of view.<br><br>
If the Secretary of State thinks that that solves the problems of secondary picketing, he has another think coming. If that is the situation, I will tell him what will happen.<br><br>
Instead of the shop stewards' convenor phoning to tell the second convenor that the shop stewards' committee is on its way down, he would pick up the phone to tell them that the whole damn yard is on its way down. Instead of having a dozen shop stewards outside the gate, he would have 2,000 workers and then the challenge would be to the employer in the second yard to identify the 2,000 and take action against them.<br><br>
If the employer, in that situation, identified the convenor and took action against him, does the Secretary of State think that the convenor would run away or hide from that situation? In all probability, the convenor would welcome the honour of being one of the martyrs of the Labour movement. There is no shadow of doubt that, at the end of the day, he would pay no damages or fines to the employer. At the end of the day, he would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1394</span>
end up in prison and that is the problem the Government would have to contend with. After all this legislation, particularly clause 14, there is prison waiting at the end where the Government will have to put shops stewards, convenors and trade officials. They know what the ramifications of that will be—a general strike.<br><br>
I want to make this point forcibly. We recognise that the Tory Government dislike the trade union movement and wish to place shackles upon it. We detest the Bill and shall oppose it tooth and nail. But we seek, particularly on clause 14, to put down amendments which will be beneficial to them and assist them to get off the hooks that they are creating for themselves. They are as insensitive as usual and cannot even recognise the hooks that we are describing to them. They have not the sense to see that they are sowing the seeds of their own destruction.<br><br>
I trust that the message will go out that the Government will be hung by clause 14. They deserve to be hung, particularly the Secretary of State, who does not even understand his own Bill and cannot explain to the Committee what will flow from clause 14. We recognise that the Under-Secretary has a difficult task. He knows the Bill well, and it would have been far better if the Secretary of State had not bothered to come along on Tuesday afternoon but had left it to the Under-Secretary, who does understand it. Even though he may not like some parts of the legislation, at least he understands it and answers our arguments.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
It is becoming a bit much when the Secretary of State turns up repeatedly, not understanding the Bill, and lectures the Committee on clauses which he does not know, has not read and does not understand. I hope that the message will go to the Secretary of State, at least for the remainder of the Committee's proceedings, "For God's sake, give us peace. Do not confuse the Committee any further."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak at this stage, Mr. Leadbitter, but in view of the advice that you gave us, I should like to say a few words now.<br><br>
In relation to what the Attorney-General and the Secretary of State said to us the other day, I find it difficult to see how they could take what I can only describe as an extraordinarily relaxed attitude to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1251">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1395</span>
probable outcome of this part of the legislation. Several of my hon. Friends have summed up the situation succinctly by saying that the Government are happy with picketing, provided that it will not be successful.<br><br>
The Secretary of State, when he addressed the Committee, placed much of his emphasis on the sins of secondary picketing, especially in relation to the events of the winter of 1978–79. But, as I pointed out earlier, most of the complaints at that time, though not all, were not related to secondary picketing. We must try to get this into perspective. There were relatively few incidents of substance and the situation was brought under control pretty quickly.<br><br>
We are talking about people who, in at least one of the major disputes, had never been on strike in this way before. It is not surprising that in those circumstances things from time to time did not run as smoothly as they should have. But the situation was brought fairly rapidly under control. Subsequent to that, the TUC guidelines were re-issued and re-emphasised in agreement with the Labour Government. Those guidelines have now been totally undermined.<br><br>
There has been a number of references during the debate to the Hadfield situation. My hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) is probably much better qualified to talk about that than I, but I wanted to make one or two points on it because I noticed that the Chief Constable for South Yorkshire gave evidence to the Select Committee on Employment. It is worth drawing the Committee's attention to some of the things that he said. He was asked particularly about intimidation at Hadfields, and he said that 35 people were abused or spat upon. Clearly, we deplore that. Neither side of the House condones that sort of behaviour.<br><br>
But the Chief Constable also suggested that it was right to try to put the whole thing into perspective, and he told the Select Committee that at the end of the day at Hadfields, 97 per cent. of the work force—these were management figures—entered the factory and that the only injury caused was to one police officer and that that was accidental. As I say, it was necessary to put the matter into perspective.<br><br>
He expressed also to the Select Committee that he agreed, as did all the chief constables who gave evidence, that the existing laws on picketing give the police
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1396</span>
adequate power to maintain order. I therefore think that there is not the problem which the Government seek to present.<br><br>
I turn to the question of identification, which I suggest that both the Attorney-General and the Secretary of State dismissed with astonishing lightness. Both seemed to take the view that it would be easy to identify pickets. I wonder whether that is their view. Will employers be able to do this with ease? The Attorney-General referred to the question of masks. That may be fanciful—I suggest that it is. The Secretary of State said that no one would want to wear a mask because pickets are seeking publicity for their action.<br><br>
I suggest that if they want to achieve publicity, perhaps pickets should turn up in masks. I can imagine the interesting photographs that would appear in the newspapers if pickets chose to do so, but I do not think that it is likely that they will. I accept the Government's view that it is unlikely, because not many people on a picket line—which is a serious business—would want to trivialise the situation in that way. I rule that out.<br><br>
We are talking about secondary picketing, and I wonder how, in a mass picket, the employer at the plant concerned will identify people on the picket line. We are not talking about people from his plant, but about people who have come in from somewhere else to picket. The chances of their faces being known are slender. My right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) has already mentioned photographs, and a growth industry there for photographers and people with cine-cameras.<br><br>
I suggest that there is a more serious aspect to consider in that respect. We all know how, in any sort of crowd situation, the presence of a television camera can create violence and certainly provoke a reaction. I do not like the idea of people going around with any kind of camera, unless they are recognised press photographers from the area about whom no one will worry—indeed those on picket lines will not, in the main, be unhappy to have pictures taken for their publicity purposes. But if they see someone who in their view is a management spy—because that is how the action will be seen—one may imagine the provocation that could be caused. I suggest that that is asking for trouble.<br><br>
Again on the question of identification, and mass picketing, if pickets come from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1252">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1397</span>
another plant within the same company group, it is not unlikely that some will be identifiable. But we are talking about flying pickets. We may be talking about pickets coming from Yorkshire to Kent, which has happened quite recently. How could they be identified by the employer concerned? On that score the Attorney-General told us that the organisers will be picked out. The right hon. and learned Gentleman did not seem to consider it cause for any great concern if such people chose martyrdom, which might well be the case. He seemed to think that that was a possibility but not something which worried him unduly.<br><br>
I think that the right hon. and learned Gentleman should feel extremely worried at the prospect of creating martyrs by picking out the ringleaders of such action. That takes us straight back to the Penton-ville Five situation. If the Government want to create martyrs, if they want to tread that road and to foment strikes and heighten tension, they are choosing a splendid way in which to do it. I have already referred in terms of heightening the tension to the "deeming" proposition and what was said about that. I refer to this in passing, as the subjects are related. Indeed, as the <i>Daily Tele- graph</i> story suggested, the topic is very much related to this particular package of proposals and to the picketing issue that we are discussing.<br><br>
Perhaps this could be passed on to the Secretary of State in the hope that he will be with us later in the day. I wonder what his view actually is on this proposal of deeming. Is he as apprehensive as the newspapers suggest about it? Is he for it or against it? Or will he resign over it? Is that one of the issues which he would not tolerate? It would be helpful to us to know what his position is; perhaps if he comes to the Committee this afternoon he can throw some light on that point.<br><br>
I am not against picketing; I do not think that any member of the Committee is against it. The police already have powers to deal with the numbers, and they are satisfied with them. But the extent of the proposals that we are considering in this clause is in some ways a serious infringement of the right to demonstrate and rights of freedom of association, which, in this country, we have always guarded very jealously, and rightly so. In that sense, I think the proposals are wrong in principle. I think that in industrial
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1398</span>
relations terms they are even more wrong, in terms of their practical application. I think that the Government have embarked upon a dangerous and potentially disastrous course. It will give me no great pleasure to tell the Government in due course: "We told you so."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gorst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If there is a conflict between the undisputed right to picket and the right to demonstrate, and if these two are irreconcileable, which of those two rights would the hon. Gentleman prefer to see abandoned, so that the other right could be pursued?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that there is a conflict. That is my point. The limiting of the right of individuals to demonstrate by picketing is an inhibition on the kind of freedom that we in this country have always held very dear.<br><br>
Notwithstanding all that the Government have told us about mandates, I do not think that the people of this country can possibly be expected to understand the complexities of the Bill. They have seen the Government's actions on picketing in what one might call shorthand terms, and in an emotive way. I think that they, too, will realise in due course—and it will be a rather forceable realisation—that they will end up as the victims of the Government's confrontational approach to these problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a protracted but none the less valuable debate on the principle of clause 14. I, for one, was grateful for your intimation, Mr. Leadbitter, that this would be in order, and that we could continue to go beyond the confines of the group of four amendments which we are discussing, although I must crave the forgiveness of the Committee if I somewhat tediously apply myself to the terms of those amendments at some stage during my speech.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo), with his inquiring mind, opened up a fascinating avenue for us, as he often does. While I am certainly flattered to share the courtesy title of "learned" with the hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson)—I am sorry he is not here at the moment—I certainly do not lay claim to any special entitlement to that. I think that we might extend these courtesies much more widely. When I listened
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1253">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1399</span>
to the speech of the hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher) and of the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) when they strove so earnestly to show that there was no need for a change in the law, I thought they were entitled to be called "honourable and gallant " Members. It must be apparent that there is a strong desire for a change in the law so far as it affects secondary picketing.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
What do we mean by secondary picketing? We mean picketing at somewhere other than where one works—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is only trying to help me to help the Committee. I have listened to the debate for several hours and I thought that I could best help it by completing the first paragraph of my speech without interruption.<br><br>
In order to substantiate my claim that there is a wide demand for this, I cite a passage from the manifesto upon which the Government was elected in May last year with a majority of just under 60:
<br><blockquote><p>"Workers involved in a dispute have a right to try <i>peacefully</i> to persuade others to support them by picketing, but we believe that right should be limited to those in dispute picketing at their own place of work."</p></blockquote>
That could not have been more clearly expressed, and the Conservative Party's intention, if elected, could not have been made clearer.<br><br>
As right hon. and hon. Members know well, the polls and tests of public opinion since the election—for what they are worth—have consistently shown that not only among the general public but among trade union members, there are large majorities for this provision. Therefore the Government are not only entitled but obliged to proceed with it.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newton (Mr. Evans) was kind enough to say that I understood the Bill, even though I did not like it. I thought that that came oddly from a member of the Committee who has waxed so eloquent in the past about the impossibility of tribunals being able to see what is in people's minds and determine the motives behind their actions. I hope that I understand the Bill and I entirely
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1400</span>
approve of it—and of no provision more than this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the emphatic play that the Under-Secretary is making about widespread demand for a change in the law on picketing, now that we have the report of our 25th sitting, may I draw his attention to what the Attorney-General said:
<br><blockquote><p>"So the new clause will not make any real difference to the law on picketing."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 18 March 1980; cc. 1348–1349.]</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman has read the whole of the Attorney-General's speech, he will see that the Attorney-General was speaking of the criminal law. I know the passage very well—I have it in front of me. He was making it clear in the course of his speech and, subsequently when he was interrupted, that, save for the possible and arguable case of someone who was causing some physical obstruction to a passer-by on the pavement, no change was being made to the criminal law by clause 14 so far as that law affects picketing.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) with a beaming smile is pointing at a passage. I had better let him identify it, otherwise he will explode.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Crowther</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That sentence was uttered by the Attorney-General at the end of the paragraph in which he was referring to the civil law. He had already said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Picketing confined to peaceful persuasion and argument is not, and never has been, a criminal offence. Clause 14 means simply that a person picketing outside the amended section 15 of the 1974 Act will no longer have immunity under section 13 from civil proceedings if he induces a breach of contract."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 18 March 1980; c. 1347.]</p></blockquote>
The rest of the paragraph is related to civil law and has nothing to do with the criminal law. At the end of the paragraph he says:
<br><blockquote><p>"So the new clause will not make any real difference to the law on picketing."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 18 March 1980; cc. 1348–1349.]</p></blockquote>
If that is not right the Attorney-General should see the Editor of <i>Hansard</i> and have it put right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is perfectly clear. If the hon. Gentleman will look at the previous
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1254">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1401</span>
paragraph he will see that I have accurately summarised what the Attorney-General was saying. The earlier paragraph states:
<br><blockquote><p>"It follows that the limitation on the scope of lawful picketing proposed in clause 14 does not in any real terms extend the ambit of the criminal law."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 18 March 1980; c. 1348.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Rotherham continued by submitting that clause 14 does not affect the civil law. That is not what the Attorney-General said and certainly not what he intended to convey, nor is it what can be derived from his speech when one looks at it in context. The Attorney-General was saying that he had been asked what the position in law would be in the case of somebody who was picketing outside the protection of amended section 15 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974. That amended section will say that it is lawful to picket for various purposes—which I leave out because we know them—so long as a person is at his own place of work.<br><br>
Clause 14 removes the immunity conferred by section 13 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 from any acts which are tortious acts committed by somebody who is picketing elsewhere than his own place of work. The Attorney-General could never have said that such a change; as will be effected by clause 14, will leave the civil law on picketing untouched. Of course not. It is the whole purpose of clause 14 to alter the civil law on picketing. What he was saying—and he was expanding on what he said in the immediately preceding paragraph—was that the criminal law on picketing will not be altered in any real sense. He did not concede that it would be altered at all, but he conceded that it was arguable in a special and specific instance that he mentioned that in the case of obstruction there may be some change. I hope that I have cleared up that genuine misapprehension.<br><br>
But I must not be taken as conceding any of the other criticisms that have been made by hon. Members with less than their usual grace about the Attorney-General's assistance to the Committee.<br><br>
The purpose of these amendments is to restore to lawful picketing the wide ambit that it has at present under our existing law. The purpose of clause 14, as we know, is to restrict the immunity that tortious acts committed by pickets will have under section 13 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act to picketing

actually at one's own place of work. The amendments seek to widen that immunity once again so that it is not really distinguishable from the immunity at present enjoyed. Under amendment No. 163 a person who is picketing will have that immunity if he is picketing at the place of other workers or at the place of anybody giving aid of any sort to the firm with which he is in dispute, even to the extent of insuring that firm against loss, and so on. One can hardly get wider than that.<br><br>
Amendment No. 165 extends the immunity to somebody picketing at the premises where another trade union member works. Amendment No. 167 deals with mobile workers and says that the immunity shall extend to cases where he is picketing at the place of work of other workers a party to the dispute, or at the premises of anybody aiding the employer with whom he is in dispute.<br><br>
In paragraph 173 the definition is added to place of work. It embraces the whole establishment or plant and not simply the particular plant or other section where the picket works. It extends also to sites used by associated employers.<br><br>
That is the whole purpose, and I understand why amendments have been proposed. I acknowledge that it is incumbent upon the Government to explain why there should be a tighter restriction upon the immunity for tortious acts—and we are talking only about those tortious acts which involve inducing breach of contract or threatening to induce breach of contract—in the case of secondary picketing than in the case of other secondary industrial action such as blacking.<br><br>
The discrepancy has been pointed out, rightly, and I must deal with it. The Government believe that there is a need for tighter restriction for picketing than for other industrial action, when we look at each in a secondary context. The reason is that secondary picketing is the easiest way for workers in dispute to cause damage to employers who are not involved in that dispute.<br><br>
Flying pickets can move about the country interrupting the movement of goods in order to accelerate or intensify the effect of a strike. A particularly unacceptable feature of secondary picketing is that it can lead to interference with an employer's business even when his employees would prefer to carry on working, because the pickets are able to turn back lorries collecting or delivering

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1403</span>
goods, for example—in practice they are not in law allowed so to do; I take the point made by the hon. Member for Newton—or because the employees themselves are frightened of going to work.<br><br>
That is why we believe, in essence, that a tighter restriction is needed. When I heard the speech of the right hon. Member for Chesterfield and many of his hon. Friends talking about restriction upon the right of trade union members to enlist the solidarity of other trade unionists, and about the honour of achieving martyrdom and so on, I marvelled to myself that there was no mention whatsoever of the interests of those trade union members who—as often happens—are in no dispute with their employers but who are obliged by secondary picketing to watch their work and their livelihoods being destroyed, perhaps for ever.<br><br>
That may happen in the case of a secondary firm being picketed which has no connection with the dispute and no means of influencing the outcome of that dispute, yet its operations are brought to a halt, perhaps never to be able to be resumed. No mention of their interests was heard.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope, on reflection, that the Minister will withdraw that propaganda remark, because he knows that it is not true. He knows that on many occasions other trade union leaders have spoken about this subject, and he knows, too, that the TUC last year brought out a code of conduct because of its concern at some of the actions that were being carried out.<br><br>
Will the hon. and learned Gentleman accept that the situations he is now describing have always taken place against a background of national strikes involving large groups of workers who knew that they were not only striking against the employer but were against the Government, who were seeking to impose some other economic restriction upon them. Will the hon. Gentleman also accept that during the lifetime of the Labour Government, 81 per cent. of all strikes, official and unofficial, were settled within 12 working days, and that no incident occurred on any picket line?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly acknowledge that the lorry drivers' strike took place in the context of the Labour Government
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1404</span>
seeking to enforce their statutory incomes policy. I do not acknowledge that the problems associated with secondary picketing are invariably linked with governmental intervention, and certainly not—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course they are.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newton is kind enough to ask me to deal with the point, but he is not kind enough to allow me to deal with it. It may well be that there are many instances where the Government have intervened and that has been part of the trouble that has led to picketing. I do not accept that it is only in those circumstances, but I do not much mind whatever the circumstance, because what I am concerned about is the interests of employers—and those who work for them—with no connection with the principal dispute and in no dispute with their own workers, whose businesses are liable to be destroyed by secondary picketing whose effect in practice, although it may not be sustained by law, is very severe.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman took me to task for saying that I had heard no word in the Committee that addressed itself to the interests of those people. But I do not believe that I have. If I am wrong I shall be corrected. It may be that the TUC has made reference in the past to the interests of those that I am describing, but to my recollection no one from the Opposition side who has spoken this morning or on Tuesday has uttered one sentence to recognise the interests of the people with whom I am dealing at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister comment on the contention in the editorial of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> of 13 February 1980 which said that
<br><blockquote><p>"it is the abuse of picketing, and not whether it is primary or secondary, which calls out for correction: and it is amply covered by existing law."?</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will deal in a moment with the question of whether we ought to extend the restriction upon picketing on immunity to primary action, because I agree that it calls for an answer but I should like to deal with it later. [<i>Interruption.</i>] All right, I will deal with it now. If the hon. Gentleman is inviting me to say that the Government's proposals are incomplete or inadequate, I will in a moment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1256">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1405</span>
explain why the Government do not feel it right to withdraw immunity from the consequences of acts committed while picketing at one's own place of work. I will deal with that in a moment. The passage from the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> relates to the criminal law affecting intimidation, and I shall certainly deal with that.<br><br>
Before leaving the point made by the hon. Member for Newton, let me remind him that the main Vauxhall car dealers were picketed last year in the course of the dispute that was taking place at the Vauxhall Ellesmere works, which at that point had nothing to do with—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Varley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has accused us of not being concerned with people who are not involved in a dispute and wanting to give blanket support to secondary picketing. That is not the case on this side of the Committee, nor is it the position of the TUC. He has often said that the TUC guidelines which came out last year are very good. To make it absolutely clear for the record, paragraph 9 in page 12 of the guidelines states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Unions should in general, and save in exceptional circumstances, confine picketing to premises of the parties to the dispute or the premises of suppliers and customers of those parties."</p></blockquote>
So the TUC recognises that, too. The hon. and learned Gentleman should not claim that we are unaware of these things.<br><br>
But will the Under-Secretary address himself to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Evans). He wants to use the extreme case of the Vauxhall car dealers. Let me put this proposition to him. If a firm is on strike or workers at a firm are taking industrial action, and their work is transferred to another company, would he not expect those workers to want to go to that factory at least to try to persuade peacefully their colleagues there not to undertake that work? Does he not realise the injustice of the legislation as it is at the moment? That simple act which has been customary now for a great number of years will be forbidden. That is the real point of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The first point that the right hon. Gentleman makes relates to the TUC guidelines, published in February 1979. I have often acknowledged that they are welcome in themselves, but I have said that they do not go far enough. The reason
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1406</span>
why they do not go far enough is the passage which the right hon. Gentleman read, but rather <i>sotto voce,</i> at the end of a relevant sentence:
<br><blockquote><p>"Unions should in general, and save in exceptional circumstances, confine picketing to premises of the parties to the dispute or the premises of suppliers and customers of those parties."</p></blockquote>
Although there is a recommendation that it should not go wider than that, it is a recommendation which includes within the ambit of permissible picketing the premises of suppliers and customers of those in dispute. That is not the end of it, because there is the saving provision "save in exceptional circumstances". Whereas any recommendations designed to limit the ambit of picketing are welcome from the TUC, this is far too wide to be acceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not give way. If I am to help the Committee I must deal with one intervention at a time; otherwise, I shall become lost, and I am sure that the Committee would not want that. I may lose the Committee, but I do not wish to lose myself.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Chesterfield referred to the "extreme" case of Vauxhall. I dare not mention it without provoking an explosion from the hon. Member for Newton (Mr. John Evans). I do not know why I have been assailed by the hon. Member for Newton for not agreeing that in every case it is Government intervention which has brought about excesses of secondary picketing. When I dare to I mention one, only a year old, I am told it is an extreme case.<br><br>
To deal with the substantive question from the right hon. Gentleman, which only reflects the point raised by his right hon. Friend last Tuesday, I acknowledge that the provisions of clause 14 will enable an employer at the second shipyard to apply to the court for an injunction to restrain pickets from the first shipyard who are seeking to persuade workers at the second to break their contract. That would be the effect of the clause. I acknowledge that, if the law permits, workers at the first shipyard will wish to go down and seek to persuade people to break their contracts of employment.<br><br>
I disagree with the comment implicit in the question that they have no other practicable means of making their case known.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1257">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1407</span>
As my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General said, in so far as picketing is restricted to peacefully communicating information, it is not caught by this clause because there is no tort committed by somebody who simply imparts information. The sort we are concerned with is inducing people to break their contracts. It is to that that the immunity conferred by section 13 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act extends—that, and threatening to do it, and so forth.<br><br>
The definition of picketing contained in section 15 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act has two limbs. One says that it shall be lawful to impart information peacefully, and the second says that it shall be lawful peacefully to seek to persuade people to work or not to work. It is only the second which contains a tort and therefore sets up the need for immunity in certain circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister will recall, in the Vauxhall situation that stupid, irresponsible and ridiculous secondary picketing collapsed within 48 hours, following an injunction. If the people who imposed that ridiculous piece of secondary picketing had not been saved by the injunction, they would have been laughed out of the country for their stupidity.<br><br>
In the ship-repair situation which has been raised, what would be the position if the convenor at the first yard persuaded the convenor at the second yard over the telephone to take industrial action? Would the convenor at the first yard be subject to an injunction by the employer because of his seeking to persuade the employees at the second yard to break the terms of their contract?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, the Vauxhall point. I think that it is not without relevance that, however the hon. Gentleman describes that secondary picketing, the persons organising it were capable of being identified, they were identified and were served with the process of the court, contrary to the dire predicitions of hon. Gentlemen that the procedure is quite incapable of being operated. That was done, and when the order of the court was made it was at once obeyed. That is important.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was stupid and irresponsible.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1408</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So it may have been, but those concerned were not so stupid or irresponsible as to defy an order of the High Court. In so acting they were simply following a long tradition of the trade union movement in this country of obeying the law. So there is instruction to be derived, and encouragement too, from the Vauxhall dispute, however stupid or irresponsible that particular piece of picketing may have been. [<i>Interruption</i>]. I want to finish my reply to the right hon. Gentleman. It simply is not practical—</span></p>
<p>[Several hon. Members <i>rose</i>].</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One at a time please.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the Under-Secretary answer my hon. Friend's point on ship repairing and shipyards?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That just shows the difficulty of giving way to too many hon. Members at a time. The question was whether the convenor at the first shipyard would be liable to the employer at the second shipyard for persuading the second shipyard's convenor to come out on strike. That would owe nothing to clause 14. The question of whether he was liable or not would owe nothing to clause 14 because it deals with picketing only. if one were to take the standards laid down in the latest consultative paper, on the facts that the hon. Gentleman sketches in, it looks as though the second shipyard would be a supplier of services or a customer of the second shipyard, and therefore immunity would be covered.<br><br>
The principal question of the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) was: "Will these chaps not want to go down there?" The answer is that they will want to go down there; I am sure that that is being realistic. But in today's age that is surely not the only means by which people can get their case over. I have acknowledged, as my right hon. Friend and the Attorney-General did, that if people are outside the second shipyard solely imparting information, they commit no tort and therefore the question of immunity does not arise.<br><br>
What is really being said? It is being said that the only means of persuading people to give solidarity and support is by picketing, today, in 1980, by standing outside saying "Do not go in; we are on strike and we are asking you to support
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1258">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1409</span>
us" Is that really the only way in which that request can be made today?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is the most effective.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says it is the most effective way, and I am rather with him there. I want to come in a moment to why it is the most effective. But the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) acknowledges that it is not the only means—and perhaps also not the only effective means. I do not find that those who come out on strike are reticent when it comes to using the media. I do not find that they are shy when invited to say what a dispute is all about in the newspapers or on television. In practice and in real life, it cannot be argued that there are not effective means today—perhaps by the use of a district convenor, as has already been mentioned—by which requests can be made for the support and the solidarity of fellow union members without standing outside the works and picketing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mikardo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The argument is that in this modern age there are plenty of means of communication, some of them very large—mass means, we call them. But, to be realistic, the fact is that the overwhelming majority of the press always takes the view that the strike is wrong. It pumps home the employers' argument and, for every bit of lineage on page 5 given to a trade union leader, there are 10 lines on page one given to the employer. A one and-a-half-minute interview in which a trade union leader is subjected to hostile questioning is not really a means of communication, compared with the massive means available to employers, who can spend hundreds of thousands of pounds in advertising.</span></p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman suggests that the media are available to people on strike. I wonder whether he has seen this morning's <i>Daily Mirror.</i> In yesterday's <i>Daily Mirror</i> the British Steel Corporation had a very large and costly advertisement on the steel strike. Today, the <i>Mirror</i> very unusually—and that is what I want to stress—has printed a letter from a group of strikers who make the point that they have not got the money to get their case across and they ask the <i>Mirror,</i> please, on this occasion to print
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1410</span>
their letter. But that is a very rare instance, which underlines the point that my hon. Friend was making.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not seen the advertisement or the letter, but I can well visualise from what the hon. Gentleman says that the purpose of the first advertisement was to address itself to the country as a whole. It surely cannot be said, where there is a complete shutdown of the British Steel Coproration, that there has been some inadequate means of spreading the message about the need for industrial action in that case.<br><br>
But I say this, and I think that I am supported by the Leader of the Opposition. There are means by which proper communication and proper persuasion can be achieved without it having to take place outside the factory gates of a place where one does not work.<br><br>
My reference to the right hon. Gentleman picks up what my right hon. Friend said at our last sitting. He was making the distinction between secondary picketing and primary picketing, and very importantly too, as I thought. What he said was:
<br><blockquote><p>"'Secondary picketing …is not designed to stop the blackleg from doing the job of the man on strike. It is intended to stop another worker from doing the job that he usually does. That is the distinction that I make as an ordinary citizen and not as a lawyer.'"</p></blockquote>
Why he should have wished to distance himself from the distinction which has been made by a lawyer I cannot imagine, but that is what the right hon. Gentleman said. He went on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"'It is my view that in these circumstances indefensible hardship can be imposed on innocent people and on people who are not connected with the dispute. That is why the spectacle of secondary picketing has aroused widespread criticism.'"</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 18 March 1980; c. 1313.]</p></blockquote>
From that we derive more than one thing. The right hon. Gentleman, the then Prime Minister, acknowledged that secondary picketing had aroused widespread criticism and he said that the reason for it was that indefensible hardship can be imposed by it on innocent people and on people who are not connected with the dispute. That is why I believe that it cannot convincingly be argued that this clause is being advanced because the present Government, so it is said, are opposed to trade unions. That argument cannot convincingly now be put.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1259">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1411</span>
I want to say why I believe that the Prime Minister of that day was right, and I shall put it in this way. I believe that it is a principal, practical effect of picketing in a modern, industrial society where the closed shop is widespread that people are induced to stop work against their wishes by reason of their having been frightened. It is a principal practical effect of picketing in these circumstances that it frightens people and is intended to frighten people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, as he so often regrettably does when I am speaking, says "Rubbish". He has only to watch the television when there are strikes and secondary picketing to see people being threatened with the loss of their union card—" You will not work again. You will never be allowed to come here." Perhaps the hon. Gentleman sits in front of the television screen and shouts "Rubbish" at it. We have all done that from time to time. But has he seen the driver of the lorry, before he turns back, shouting "Rubbish" at the picket? I very much doubt it. What he has seen is the lorry backing away.<br><br>
Sometimes that frightening is carried to the extent that the criminal offence of intimidation is perpetrated. Of course I agree with the Attorney-General that the criminal law is adequate in the sense that a new offence is not needed. It is no good putting a new offence on the statute book—that it shall be an offence to commit a criminal offence. There are enough criminal offences on the statute book to deal under the law with all the offences against public order that can be committed on the picket line.<br><br>
The problem is enforcement. It is not enough to say "If a policeman hears the offence of intimidation being committed, he can arrest the offender. End of problem." The policeman must be present at the time. He must hear the words. There must be enough policemen to cope in a private situation. It is for that reason that it is not enough to rely on the existence of the criminal law and the ability of the police to arrest someone who is guilty of the criminal offence of intimidation. That is not enough.<br><br>
But, more often than not, the frightening conduct does not extend to the scale of the criminal offence of intimidation. It extends
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1412</span>
only to what the previous Attorney-General, in a memorable phrase, described in the House of Commons as lawful intimidation. It is for that reason that public opinion is so much against secondary picketing.<br><br>
To that extent that it is criminal, it is not enough to say, "Let the police get on and deal with it", for the reasons that I have ventured to suggest, especially in relation to the points made by the hon. Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Radice) last Tuesday. If one acknowledges that there is a problem and that rights are being interfered with which should not be interfered with, one must look to see if there are any means, short of adding to the criminal law, to remedy that situation. We believe that there are.<br><br>
We believe that, not by using the criminal law but by amending the civil law, it is possible to diminish the number of occasions on which people are deflected from doing what they want by frightening conduct, such as "If you come in here you will never work here again", or "You will lose your card and you will be blacked". The way in which we believe it is possible to do that is reflected in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Giles Radice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All that the Minister has been saying is just an argument against picketing as such. If he believes that picketing is genuinely intimidatory, let him have the courage of his convictions and abolish picketing altogether. I am sure that the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) would be delighted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, with his logical and acute mind, has exactly anticipated the next stage of my argument. He has only slightly delayed it. The question then arises, why, therefore, permit picketing at all, even at one's own place of work? Picketing is generally held in this country wherever it takes place—to be disagreeable. The question is whether it ought to be regarded at any place as a necessary evil. It is out of date.<br><br>
I believe that the Webbs were right—and the hon. Gentleman referred to their book this morning—when they said something to the effect that, with the advent of better and modern means of communication—not merely transport, but expressing and publishing one's opinions—the need for picketing was diminishing and that it was becoming a thing of the past, or something like it. But, today, how much
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V001P0I1260">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1413</span>
more strongly that argument can be put. I do not want to go over it again but today we have television, newspapers, the tele-phone; it cannot be said that one must picket in order effectively to persuade.<br><br>
On the other hand, we know that picketing at one's own place of work is deeply entrenched in the traditional prac-tices of the trade unions. I believe a stronger case can be made for allowing it to remain lawful and therefore immune from restraint when it is directed to persuading people not to work for one's own—or one's own former—employer at the place where one works or used to work before one got the sack as a result of an industrial dispute. There can be made a stronger case for that remaining lawful than can be made for it remaining lawful when it is directed against a stranger employer and a stranger work force at premises where one has never worked. Only one's own employer is in dispute with one.<br><br>
I acknowledge that there is an illogicality in the Government proposing that it should continue to remain lawful at one's own place of work, but, as I have often acknowledged, industrial relations are not to be decided upon and do not depend upon nice and logical considerations. It is because we believe that a sensible, practicable and readily understood distinction can be made between picketing at one's own place of work and at a more remote place—that is, secondary picketing—that we believe that this is a proper distinction to reflect in legislation.<br><br>
Much has been said about the difficulties of knowing what one's own place of work is. It is not necessary for a statute to have statutory definitions of every concept that finds a place in the sections of the Act. In the vast majority of cases there will be no real difficulty in knowing where they
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1414</span>
work. I ought to deal with the various illustrations given.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. Crowther) said that at Rotherham there were employers with groups which were separated sometimes by five miles. One could not say that one was picketing at one's own place of work if one sought to picket at a place five miles away. There would be no difficulty about that.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) on Tuesday raised the question of the <i>Daily Mirror,</i> the <i>News of the World</i> and the <i>Sun</i> being printed in the same place. If an employee of the <i>Sun</i> is picketing and he turns away a lorry of the <i>News of the World,</i> what about that? I would expect a court to find that he was picketing at his own place of work, without any difficulty. What about action by the <i>News of the World</i> against a lorry firm which never delivered the ink? That would be a question of contract. Whatever the contractual terms were between the <i>News of the World</i> and the transport firm would govern that.<br><br>
What about journalists? Where is their place of work? I think they come under clause 15(2). They work in several places, and therefore one would have to see where their work was administered from or where they actually worked from. What about the writer writing from home for a publication for 20 years? Could he picket at the office? No. Why should he? Surely a writer can harldy complain that the only means by which he can communicate is by picketing outside the head office.</span></p>
