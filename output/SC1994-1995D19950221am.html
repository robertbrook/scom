	<p>[MR. NICHOLAS WINTERTON

	<div class='debates'>

	<section>

	<div class='bill'>Finance Bill</div> <!-- bill -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the benefit of those members of the Committee who were concerned about my health at the end of last week, I have just run up the stairs, and I am still healthy. I hope that all members of the Committee had a satisfactory and restful weekend. We must now return to the business of the Finance Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alistair Darling 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. Clauses 71 and 72 go together; some of the issues raised in clause 72 will come up when we debate clause 71. Clause 71 certainly will not go through on the nod. Those members of the Committee who are fascinated by the operations of the gilt market are no doubt looking forward to the delight of several hours' discussion. It might be convenient for the Committee if I canvass the Opposition's general concerns when we debate clause 71, which would mean that the debate on clause 72 would be very short indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 73 raises slightly different issues, about which we shall need to have a longer debate. I intend to restrict my remarks almost exclusively to clause 71, but inevitably parts of clause 72 will come in as well. If that is acceptable to you, Mr. Winterton, I shall proceed on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point of order that was raised by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) is valid. If he believes that his suggestion would help, and if members of the Committee are agreeable, I am perfectly happy to allow a wider debate, which will incorporate matters that are specific to clause 72. We should proceed on the basis, of course, that we do not have a lengthy stand part debate on clause 72.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 71</div> <!-- clause -->

	<section>

	<div class='title'>SALE AND REPURCHASE OF SECURITIES: EXCLUSION FROM ACCRUED INCOME SCHEME</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you for your ruling, Mr. Winterton. I am sure that I speak for all Opposition Members—or at least those who are currently filing into the Room—when I say that we shall be happy to proceed on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reform of the gilt market is major, and Opposition Members should not simply nod it through. It is one of the biggest changes to the market since the so-called big bang reforms in 1986. The gilt-edged market was not deregulated at that date, but the present proposal is to deregulate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not have any objection in principle about opening up the gilt-edged market—there are many
	<span class='label label-info column'>358</span>
advantages in so doing. Our worries fall, broadly, into three categories: regulation, interest rate volatility and taxation, which is especially relevant to the Finance Bill. I shall outline some of my worries, to which I hope the Minister of State will respond. The Committee's debate should flow from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take as my starting point the consultative document published by the Bank of England on Budget day. That useful and readable document sets out the general background. I shall not read from it in any great detail, because I am sure that members of the Committee are familiar with it. It sets out the history of the regulated gilt market, and states that, in other international markets, there is a more open market for sale and repurchase agreements. It is in line with the Chancellor's remarks, and considers ways of opening up the market in the United Kingdom. Many advantages are thought to flow from that reform. I was struck by paragraph 9 of the document, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Bank does not wish gilt repo activity to develop in advance of any date decided in due course for implementation of the proposals in an orderly manner."</p></blockquote>
That is not the most elegantly phrased paragraph that I have come across and it is open to more than one interpretation—perhaps a few more commas would not have gone amiss. But I get the general drift, which is that the Bank is concerned that the changes should take place in an orderly manner. If they proceed in a disorderly manner, we risk the kind of volatility that, I understand, has been experienced in markets elsewhere in the world, or a repetition of the volatility that followed the big bang and the deregulation of the general equities market in the mid 1980s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do the Government have a date in mind? As I understand it, the Government have to name a date for bringing into effect section 737A under the clause. It would be helpful if the Minister would let us know what the Government's timetable is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to canvassing the merits of extending the market—which I do not intend to go into—the bank raises other concerns. Paragraph 19 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The concern has been expressed that repo, by facilitating greater leveraged activity in gilts, could increase the volatility of gilt prices."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to observe:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But there is no clear indication that other securities markets where repo is permitted have experienced an increase in volatility as a result".</p></blockquote>
It says that there is no clear indication, which suggests that there has been some sign that elsewhere there has been an increase in the volatility of gilt prices. I would be grateful if the Government would tell us their views on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The substantial point canvassed by the Bank of England consultative document is that of regulation, which is one of my central concerns today. The bank envisages that it would continue to supervise the capital adequacy of stock exchange money brokers, intending to concentrate predominantly on providing a specialised service to the gilt-edged market makers. It goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Alternatively, stock exchange money brokers may want to participate in gilt repo with a wider range of counterparties or to broaden their activities. There will be no bar to a SEMB doing so but the Bank would not be its supervisor for capital adequacy purposes."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0709">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>359</span>
If the bank did not do that, who would? Presumably, it would be one of the other regulatory authorities—before we agree to the facilitating clauses it is important to be certain about regulation. Once the market is deregulated and the existing closed shop is dismantled—hon. Members will be pleased to hear that we are as enthusiastic as anybody about getting rid of this particular closed shop—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Hoon 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ashfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All closed shops.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or all closed shops, as my hon. Friend, Mr. New Labour, mutters. Once we get rid of the closed shop and allow a wider range of people to participate in the sale and repurchase agreements, and once the market is opened up internationally, there will be no going back. It is therefore important that the market should be as regulated as possible, consistent with maintaining a free market and the general public interest. Clearly the Bank envisages that it would continue to supervise capital adequacy of the stock exchange money brokers, but it also recognises the possibility of others being responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultative period for the document finished on 31 March, so the responses must have been received. What is the Bank's conclusion on this and other matters? More importantly, as the Government are still in charge, what are their conclusions on the matters raised in the consultative paper?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph 27, the Bank considers the implications for the equity market and raises other concerns, saying that it is in discussion with the Securities and Investments Board and the stock exchange in order to review various regulatory issues. Clause 28 goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Changes to Stock Exchange rules would be necessary to permit gilt repo transactions by members of the exchange. This would be a matter for consideration by the Stock Exchange."</p></blockquote>
What are those changes and to what conclusions have the bank and the Government come?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From paragraph 29 onwards the issue of prudential supervision is canvassed. I agree with the Bank's view that it is important that that activity should take place within a properly regulated framework. What form should that properly regulated framework take? What views did the Government and the Bank receive during the consultative process? What decision have the Government taken?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bank does not envisage that any formal changes in the structure of the supervisory arrangement are necessary. It does not envisage such changes, but the fact that it flags them up suggests that some thought may have been given to them. Will the Government tell us what changes were considered? Equally, reference was made to the capital adequacy directive of March 1993. It comes into effect on the last day of this year and prescribes minimum standards to be applied by banking and security supervisors within the European Union. I understand that regulators are currently examining the rules which they need to apply and which have to be finalised by 1 July. What stage and conclusions have the regulators reached?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bank has said that its provisions on the conduct of business in the wholesale markets—known as the London
	<span class='label label-info column'>360</span>
code of conduct—would apply to such business. Will any changes be made?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those issues may not excite the ordinary man or woman in the street nor, indeed, members of the Committee—apart from myself and the Minister who is working himself into a state of excitement even as I speak—but they are important. The usual story is familiar to us: something happens; there is a bit of deregulation; shortly afterwards something goes wrong and questions are asked as to who was supposed to be dealing with such matters. We must get it right at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the heading "A sound and orderly market" the Bank asserts in paragraph 37:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The round of discussions already held also indicated a strong desire for a code of conduct".</p></blockquote>
I agree wholeheartedly. What stage have we reached on that matter? The Bank also wanted
	<br><blockquote><p>"to monitor closely activity in gilt repo in support of its operational responsibility for gilt-edged funding".</p></blockquote>
The Bank will undertake that activity as part of its general duties. However, it is clear from the tenor of the consultative document that changes have been contemplated. Some may be necessary, some not. During our debate this morning, will the Government outline their conclusions and those of the Bank?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultation period was fairly short, only spanning a couple of months, including the Christmas break. However, as the provisions are envisaged to come into effect some time this year—if I am wrong, no doubt the Minister will correct me—we must have a clearer idea, even though we are only in the second half of February, about what stage we have reached. We do not believe that the clause should be simply nodded through on his assurance that it will be all right on the night. We must get such matters right and it is important that we are satisfied, as legislators, that the Bank of England, which is discharging the public duty primarily on our behalf, has consulted widely and that it is proposing to ensure that, as there is a deregulated market, adequate supervision is still in place to safeguard the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair to say that, in other parts of the world, such issues have generally not presented problems. However, an article in the 
	<i>Financial Times,</i> which appeared the day after last November's Budget, stated that the Mellon bank of the United States had announced hefty provisions to cover investment losses after the fall in the US bond prices last year. The bank was satisfied that.
	<br><blockquote><p>"the prudential problems initially experienced in repo markets in other countries can be addressed".</p></blockquote>
That illustrates that problems have arisen elsewhere. The Bank is confident that those problems can be dealt with. Will the Minister tell us what is proposed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subject of interest rate volatility is directly involved because one advantage of a deregulated market is that it is said to make Government borrowing easier and ultimately, cheaper. We shall see. That issue was much in the minds of members of the Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee, where I came across a formidable piece of cross-examination by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman) of the Chief Secretary. The hon. Gentleman clearly had such a development in mind when he asked about the likely consequences of the proposed changes to the gilt repo market, to which the Chancellor referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0710">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>361</span>
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the minutes of the Select Committee, when probed directly on that matter, the Chief Secretary responded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I do not think we have a clear forecast for that … I am not aware of any clear forecast at the moment."</p></blockquote>
He might have been speaking from bitter experience—although a relatively new Treasury Minister, he had already learnt that Treasury forecasting is not foolproof. It is not encouraging that the Government are not making a clear forecast. The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington pressed the Chief Secretary by explaining that he was thinking in terms of consequences rather than forecasts. The Chief Secretary replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I think there would be a lower cost."</p></blockquote>
We are now getting somewhere—he was not making a forecast, but was prepared to hazard a guess that there might be a lower cost to borrowing. The hon. Gentleman then asked the Chief Secretary:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Are you expecting, for example, a continuing risk premium on UK debt as compared with, say, French or German debt?"</p></blockquote>
The Chief Secretary replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am afraid I am out of my depth on such continental matters."</p></blockquote>
It is hardly encouraging when the second most senior Treasury Minister, if we exclude the Prime Minster, says that. Perhaps because Europe was mentioned, the Chief Secretary was hesitating for an eternity before plunging into an answer. But it is not encouraging for the Committee, which is being invited to endorse the changes, that the Government's senior financial spokesman, second only to the Chancellor, is not able to respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the Chief Secretary cannot be with us today because the Cabinet is discussing an important matter, but his opinion must be known to other Treasury Ministers. It would be helpful if the Minister of State, who is at home in continental matters and who is on the side of the pro-Europeans, would let us know why his senior colleague told the Committee that he was out of his depth on such continental matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington was not put off by the Chief Secretary's response. He kept pressing his right hon. Friend who said that it was a difficult forecasting area. According to the minutes, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am hesitant about swimming in these waters."</p></blockquote>
The Chief Secretary was asked his opinion on interest rates. He said that he could not forecast, but that there might be a lower cost. He then admitted that he was out of his depth on such continental matters and that he did not like swimming in those waters. There is a contrast to that. The Chief Secretary went on to say in the minutes of evidence that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in his Budget statement, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'This should improve both liquidity and efficiency, reducing yields and hence the Government's debt interest costs.'"</p></blockquote>
That is typical of the Chancellor's broad-brush approach. One can imagine his civil servants putting that into his speech: the Chancellor will have taken a puff on his cigar and said, "Yes, that's fine. I'll just add it" and not give the matter further thought. Perhaps the Chief Secretary agonised over that and realised that it was not as straightforward as one might think.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>362</span>
Yet again we have a slight difference of opinion, if not quite a split, in the Government ranks on what is supposed to happen as a result of the changes. Will the Minister jump into those waters and let us know the Government's forecasts and expectations? Will there be a continuing risk premium on United Kingdom debt as opposed to that in France or Germany?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next point involves tax. Clauses 71 and 72 contain proposals to accommodate the changes and change the tax regime. I am sure that all members of the Committee saw the 
	<i>Financial Times</i> this morning which, contained a timely article entitled:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Time to polish up tarnished gilts".</p></blockquote>
It was written by two respected members of the paper's staff. The article canvasses a number of substantial changes to Government practice and taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we are in Committee and the Minister is before us, we are entitled to an answer. The article raises the question of whether we are going to abolish what is, in effect, a withholding tax for gilts. That matter was also canvassed in the excellent 
	<i>Greenwell Gilt Weekly,</i> which I am sure is read by members of the Committee and which is published by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. A lucid article written by Roger Bootle, with whom I do not always agree; but whose articles are very readable, draws attention to the fact that he believes that the Government will change the provisions on that withholding tax because it is deducted at source at basic rate. Will the Government change that? We are entitled to a clear answer to that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The article also says that consideration is being given to introducing an auction calendar. I understand that in other continental European countries, it is common to have an auction calendar so that people know when Government stock is to be auctioned off. That does not happen in this country—will it be introduced? Will we have greater bench mark issues of gilts? That would be a fundamental change to the way in which the gilt market operates. It also suggests that changes to the way in which transactions are settled are proposed to allow settlement overseas in international systems. Clearly, several changes are contemplated and, if the 
	<i>Financial Times</i> and Mr. Bootle at 
	<i>Greenwell Gilt Weekly</i> know about them, the Committee, which is being invited to endorse further tax changes, is also entitled to share in the Government's knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there are to be tax changes, we are entitled to know whether the Government believe that they will lead to a more efficient system. I understand that the Government's purpose is to open up the market, and it is inevitable that certain changes will have to be made, but I am sure that the Committee will understand our concerns, especially the regulatory concern. We are entitled to know the Government's opinion on volatility. Perhaps I should say another Government opinion on volatility, as we have two so far and there are another three Treasury Ministers. We should discover what they think—never mind what those who sit behind them think.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tax changes are a matter for the Committee. We are being invited to endorse two changes today—in clauses 71 and 72—and we shall come to clause 73 shortly. Clearly, the Government are contemplating more changes. The Government have conducted a wide-ranging consultative exercise on the issues canvassed in the Bank
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0711">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>363</span>
of England document, but they are also having discussions with various other people on tax changes. In the interests of open Government and of ministerial accountability, we are entitled to press the Minister to give us answers to those questions so that we can have a proper debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should begin my brief remarks by declaring my interest, which is in the Register of Members' Interests, and which is relevant to the debate. I advise Salomon Brothers International, which is heavily involved in the derivatives business. However, I do not speak on behalf of Salomon because, as the Committee will know, I raised the subject in debate last year when we had a good discussion on the basis of advice provided by the British Merchant Banking and Security Houses Association. I am sure that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central will remember that. He was kind enough to act as my representative on earth and my personal public relations company when he referred to the questions that I put to the Chief Secretary in the Select Committee. So I have some small right to say a few words on the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his remarks, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central focused on three aspects of concern relating to the derivatives business in the financial sector. He talked first about regulation. Without being too pedantic, I should point Out that regulation is outwith the strict purview of the Committee. Therefore, I shall not dwell on it, except to say that it is important that the regulatory regime, which the Treasury and other Whitehall departments seek to impose on that sector of financial services, should be consistent with the best and most cost-effective regulation elsewhere in competing countries. Otherwise, this country will, increasingly, be at a disadvantage, which would be a pity because we have considerable strengths.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue raised by the hon. Gentleman was the vexed matter of interest rate volatility and the effect of the changes announced by the Chancellor in his Budget last year upon that problem. It is a problem for British industry and commerce, and worldwide. Many people say—I am sure that they have done so, Mr. Winterton, in Macclesfield and elsewhere—that interest rate volatility is in many ways more damaging to industrial and commercial interests when trying to make long-term plans than any given level of interest rates. Interest rate stability is perhaps the most important single aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the legislative changes that we are discussing have at least a marginal effect in introducing greater stability for British interest rates, that will be no bad thing. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will respond to that point on whicli—as the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central said slightly cattily—my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor seemed unable to give a conclusive answer when I requested him in the Select Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third point on which the hon. Gentleman focused is germane to our debate and concerns the taxation regime for derivatives. That activity, which is now conducted on a considerable scale in London and other parts of the United Kingdom, possibly also in Edinburgh, is very mobile. It can be switched at the behest of a few telephone calls or a few faxes. Many large firms in the financial services sector which conduct such business have offices
	<span class='label label-info column'>364</span>
in other competing financial centres to which they could allocate the business if the taxation regime here proves to be hostile or uncongenial to those activities. That is not an empty threat. Already in the European Union, leaving aside some of the more dubious places outside—such as Switzerland which specialises in secrecy—bom Ireland and Luxembourg have their own jurisdiction over such matters for tax purposes. The European Union has not yet invaded those jurisdictions and arrogated them to itself. Many firms could as easily conduct such business in Dublin or Luxembourg were the tax regime to be uncongenial here. Some activities are already conducted in those countries. If the regime were unsatisfactory here, such business would be lost to this country and we would no longer have that contribution to our invisible earnings and other such worthy matters which flow from this fast-growing activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dilemma in the clause is that Parliament is expected to legislate for a rapidly changing area of activity. My view is that the market in derivatives is now significantly different, more sophisticated and more subtle than at this time last year. The same argument will apply a fortiori this time next year, and so on. The change is rapid and it is difficult for the tax authorities to catch up with the position, however bright and hard-working they may be. The Inland Revenue was right to enter into detailed consultations, at the request of Ministers, with representatives of the industry to discover the best and most sensible balance between safeguarding revenue—which must be the Inland Revenue's principal responsibility—without stifling the activity in London that provides jobs, wealth and tax payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is a good example of Ministers going about the matter in the right way and I congratulate them on the cautious, sensible and almost humble way in which they approached it. I would wager that no member of the Committee fully understands the technicalities, not even the hon. Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon), who pulled a funny expression. It is therefore incumbent on Ministers and me civil servants who advise them to consult widely with the interested parties, who know more about the subject than anyone else. I am delighted that Ministers have authorised that consultation, which has taken place over the past year. Notwithstanding the hon. Gentleman's reservations when he quoted from the Bank of England's consultative document, both the industry and I think that the result is definitely a step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
London has comparative advantage in this sector, and we must retain that comparative advantage if at all possible. At all costs, we must avoid a situation in which both our tax regime and our regulatory regime become deterrents to that business expanding in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against the background that I have outlined in my necessarily general remarks, I welcome the Government's proposals and look forward to hearing from my hon. Friend the Minister the answers to some of the detailed points. I have only one detailed query, to which I should like to draw my hon. Friend's attention and which was raised in a document sent to all members of the Committee by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland. The Committee will be interested to know that I do not advise that body. The institute asked whether the exclusion
	<br><blockquote><p>"should apply from the beginning of a fiscal year, rather than part of the way through the fiscal year."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0712">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>365</span>
If that suggestion is sensible, I hope my hon. Friend the Minister will be able to indicate that he can answer that important point about timing. I stress my belief that the Government have acted prudently and sensibly in this matter, and have struck a satisfactory balance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister of State to take to the water?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Anthony Nelson)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before venturing into the deep waters, or rather the brave new world of gilt repos, I should like to say a word or two about clause 71 and its purpose. I shall then turn to the more general matters that you have allowed us to discuss, Mr. Winterton, which were commented on by my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington and the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 71 disapplies the accrued income scheme from transfers under certain agreements for the sale and repurchase of securities. Such agreements are often referred to as repos. The accrued income scheme applies to certain securities issued by companies and Governments; in particular, it applies to United Kingdom securities. Therefore, although the measure applies more widely, it would facilitate the introduction of a gilt repo market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the accrued income scheme is that the interest paid on securities is taxed on the persons who held the security during the period in which that interest accrued, rather than on the person who received the interest when it was paid. The interest is allocated between them for tax purposes in proportion to the period each person held the security. Under a repo, the economic benefit of the interest remains with the original holder of the security, to whom it returns. It would be wrong for part of the interest to be allocated for tax purposes to the person to whom the security is sold under a repo. The accrued income scheme works by reference to transfers of securities. At present, both the sale and the repurchase trigger the scheme. Clause 71 disapplies the scheme from both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central raised several points about the Government's possible proposals for the introduction of a more open gilt repo system. I should therefore like to make a statement about the Government's intentions. As the Committee is aware, the Government have been consulting widely on the establishment of an open gilt repo market. The Chancellor announced in the Budget that the Government favoured, in principle, the establishment of such a market. Following the consultation process undertaken by the Bank of England and the Inland Revenue, the Government have decided to proceed with the establishment of a repo market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The introduction of the repo market will be accompanied by the introduction of gross payment of interest on gilts to all likely participants in the gilt repo market who so choose, combined with a system of quarterly accounting for those gilt holders subject to United Kingdom tax who choose to receive interest gross. The Government believe, following the consultation process, that that represents the most sensible method of facilitating the introduction of an efficient and liquid
	<span class='label label-info column'>366</span>
market, while simultaneously protecting the financial position of the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope to table new clauses to the Finance Bill to effect those tax changes. We envisage that the provisions will be brought into force to allow the gilt repo market to begin on 1 January 1996. That will require the necessary legislation to be in place, the regulations to be worked up and the systems to be determined. I hope that the market will begin on 1 January 1996. We shall publish a press release later today with more details.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. I must ask him a rather elementary question—what prevents a repo market from happening anyway? If I had a gilt which my hon. Friend wanted to borrow, nothing would prevent me from lending it to him. I appreciate that tax complications are involved. Any problem in the present tax anomalies could be dealt with in the contract that my hon. Friend and I had when I lent and he borrowed the gilt. Equally, the contract has to take into account the timing of the coupon payment and who receives the coupon. That is done in any stock lending deal. Why do the Government have to take decisions, and undertake the consultation exercise, in order to allow a repo market to take place? What stops it from taking place anyway?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two essential limits operating at the moment—one is a restriction and one is a tax restraint. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) knows, the present gilt market works when the gilt-edged market makers—the so-called GEMMs—operate in the primary market. They operate with the agreement of the Bank of England and they have privileges both in operating and in their access to the gilt market. They can go short of stock and they can obtain stock to fulfil short positions by, for example, lending arrangements. That can happen at present, but it is, as it were, an exclusive GEMM, and the market is made up of an exclusive network of institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our intention is to establish an open gilt repo market, which will enable more institutions to participate directly by allowing them to go short of gilts, as the GEMMs can do at present. The first restriction is, therefore, who can operate at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, a tax restriction operates. As my hon. Friend may know, a problem arises with a gilt repo when securities are sold, but before they are repurchased interest is payable on the gilt. There has to be a manufactured payment to ensure that the counterparty repays the interest to the holder with whom the economic interest rests. If there were a mismatch between the tax status of the counterparties—if one is a net recipient and the other a gross recipient—the operation of a proper gilt repo market would, in effect, be inhibited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding was that we could change only that law to establish a repo market. However, that would require a substantial change in the bodies that are allowed to receive gross payments of interest under gilts. That would be a substantial cost, albeit only a cashflow cost. Our intention is to limit the new arrangements—with quarterly accounting and gross payments—to a number of players in the new market who will be able to set up special accounts with the Central gilts office. Essentially,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0713">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>367</span>
there have been two restrictions—the designation of the market players and the operation of the tax system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his answer, but I am not as wise on the subject as I should like to be. Will he confirm that there is no restriction at all—namely, no statutory legal restriction—on anyone borrowing or lending gilts? In so far as a repo arrangement might take place between two gross holders or two non-residents, the taxation problems would not arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted to hear that the taxation problem will be relieved by the clause and that it will be easier for anyone to engage in stock lending in British Government stocks. That has all the attractions that were described by my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor. However, I still do not understand whether there is anything to stop you and me, Mr. Winterton, from entering into a gilt repo arrangement on any day of the week that we might choose. Will my hon. Friend the Minister confirm that that is the case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the case that such operations can be conducted as I described earlier. However, the tax arrangements and the market restrictions have effectively prevented large numbers of international operators from wanting, or from being able, to come to this country. The changes, which will extend the market, will, we hope, enable institutions from abroad to come into the market and provide liquidity. I shall discuss later the rationale behind that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I say that I thought that the explanation of my hon. Friend the Minister was absolutely brilliant. It should be required reading for all members of the Committee when it appears in 
	<i>Hansard.</i> He mentioned the date of 1 January 1996. Does that meet the point to which I drew his attention, and which was made by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland? Would it be preferable for the date to be 6 April 1996?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had intended to discuss that matter later, but, given that it has been raised by my hon. Friend, I shall deal with it now. The Revenue has written to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland in connection with the clauses that deal with repos—which are largely the province of bodies within the charge to corporation tax—to say that it does not see any logic in commencement at the start of the fiscal year, because any particular commencement date will, in any case, fall part way through a company's accounting period. We do not think that there will be any problems with that arrangement. However, I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that point today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central and my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington raised three matters of concern—regulation, interest rate volatility and taxation. I shall try to straddle those matters as briefly and as pertinently as possible. We hope that the starting date will be the beginning of 1996. Originally, I had hoped that we would be able to start a gilt repo market earlier—perhaps in the middle or autumn of this year—but the changes, new systems and regulatory arrangements need to be discussed with the market and
	<span class='label label-info column'>368</span>
brought into effect together. As a result, the earlier date was not possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central rightly pointed out, we must not create a disorderly market either before or on inception. It is therefore necessary to think through the reform carefully and to ensure that the laws are not brought into effect until all the systems and regulations are up and running and we are sure that the market can be started responsibly and reliably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to volatility—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding asked a question, the Minister said that new regulations, new systems and new legislation would have to come into force and that there would be a press release this afternoon. I know that the Minister likes to keep hon. Members informed before the press. Will he tell us which regulations will be involved and which areas will be covered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.15 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, various clauses in the Bill will be involved. I cannot explain the details yet, but they will facilitate some of the changes necessary to establish the market. Later I shall briefly mention some of the other changes which may be necessary, especially on matters such as stock exchange regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central and others have spoken of volatility. Some have argued—and on the face of it, theirs is a compelling argument—that a gilt repo market effectively allows more people to go short of gilts, which can only drive gilt prices down and force yields up. What, they ask, can be the advantage of that? How can allowing more people into a shorter market benefit the taxpayer, market participants or stock holders?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am persuaded, not only by experience elsewhere but by argument, that that is a fallacious and superficial argument because it does not take into account the significant benefits brought about in terms of the interest that taxpayers have to pay on the national debt by a highly liquid bond market in our sovereign debt. More money chasing bonds, whether in the primary or secondary market, is more likely to deliver a higher price and therefore a lower yield applying to those bonds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot tell to what extent that would be the case, although interest rates in the UK bond market are perceptibly above those of other countries, notably the United States and France. We believe that that is partly caused by the relatively lower levels of liquidity and the absence of a repo market here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall later give a general outline, without going into detail, of some of the other issues that we are considering in a more general review of debt management in the UK. Taken together, I hope that the measures may have a substantial impact on eating into the premium.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be clear to the Committee that, although the subject is very technical, we are dealing with very real and very substantial sums of money. My right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor made it clear that every basis point—which is 100th of 1 per cent.—is worth £25 million. A saving of 1 per cent. brought about by a series of changes represents £2.5 billion of interest per annum, which the taxpayer will save in the financing of our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0714">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>369</span>
existing stock and new issuance of debt. The potential gains are enormous. The issue does not provoke party political differences—other than possible disagreements on how to ensure that new markets are introduced safely and responsibly—and any Government should explore carefully any opportunities for saving taxpayers considerable sums by having a more efficient and perfect market operating in sovereign bonds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister rightly said that there is a premium. Some of the problems, such as the issues that we are debating today, are technical ones, but it would be interesting to know the Treasury's view of the other, non-technical reasons why UK interest rates are slightly higher.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come later to some of the issues covered in the general review of debt management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is suggesting—slightly mischievously, I suspect—mat, quite apart from any differential at a given level of interest rates, we have to pay a high overall level of interest rates for issuance of debt because of macroeconomic instability over a long period. Undoubtedly, while our important and valuable fine-tuning mechanisms should reduce the premium to be paid for the issuance of British Government debt, monetary policy and the level of interest in the UK are obviously prime determinants of the overall price of that debt in gilts. Equally, that monetary policy reflects not only the economic position at any given moment, but the low inflation over a record period in the UK economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central represents a party which, when in Government, brought about record levels of inflation and interest rates, so he should know better than anybody the price that had to be paid, both at the time and subsequently, for those policies, which are part of the record of macroeconomic instability, which ensures for a long time until a Government can regain a reputation for seeking sound money. Happily, we have managed mat—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members might want to hold their collective horses. If the Minister is right, why is the United Kingdom still paying that price 16 years after the change of Government? Does not the fact that there is still a premium suggest that the markets still do not have confidence in the UK even after 16 years of Tory Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be slightly at sea—he gave us some maritime metaphors on this issue earlier. There is a difference between the overall level of interest rates payable and the premium over and above that paid by other countries for issuing their sovereign debt. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the overall level of interest rates is affected by domestic and external factors—a comparison with the pricing of sovereign bonds elsewhere, the domestic monetary stance and the rate of inflation determine the real rate of interest required in the markets for that pricing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not look at the situation in isolation, we look carefully at the yield curve. The long end of the yield curve has declined as we have put up interest rates preemptively from a position of strength in order to reassure the markets that we mean what we say about maintaining
	<span class='label label-info column'>370</span>
low inflation. That flattening out of the yield curve is a good thing. The profile of the yield curve must be considered separately from its height. Ideally, one would want a marginally rising, but almost flat yield curve which would show that, over a long period, people's perceptions on low inflation were being maintained. The level of the curve depends on a variety of domestic and external factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the responsibility is not just that of a Labour Government in the distant, but certainly not dim past. We have to buy the hard-earned confidence of the market in the fact that we are serious about sound money and low inflation. Rhetoric is not enough. Delivering low inflation is only part of the battle; the other is to maintain that low inflation, having the plateau of macroeconomic stability which allows a lower rate of interest, which determines how much real money is paid out on the taxpayer's behalf to finance public debt. We are endeavouring to do that by redressing the state of public finances through a monetary stance which continues to bear down on inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central asked about regulation. He raised some important points that were referred to in the consultation document issued by the Bank of England. It is not envisaged that any formal changes in the structure of supervisory arrangements would be necessary to accommodate business in gilt repos, but the Bank of England will broadly supervise the establishment of the new market because it is responsible for the supervision of banks authorised under the Banking Act 1987. The wholesale market supervision division of the Bank is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations and will examine in particular the arrangements for the capital adequacy directive. The detailed implementation of the CAD has been the subject of discussion with the market participants and it is hoped that by the middle of this year we will have further details on exactly what the requirements will be after that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While GEMMs may be subject to Bank supervision, an open gilt repo market means that other institutions can enter that market that may not be supervised under the Banking Act. Such banks will be subject to the investment or securities regulator, which might be the Security and Futures Authority, and by the Financial Services Act 1986, section 43 of which sets out the mechanisms for supervision of that aspect. Participants will be caught under one heading or the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central asked what changes to the stock exchange rules would be necessary. The establishment of the gilts repo market will require changes in its rules to allow member firms to participate. Changes will also be necessary to remove restrictions on stock lending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether there would be a continuity of risk premium over continental bond markets. The interesting, intellectual, but very real issue is that we shall not ever be able to prove the benefit of the changes because we shall not be able to assess what would otherwise have happened. However, all the experience of other bond markets—not only in the United States, where there has been an open repo market for many years, but, more recently, in Italy and in France—has been that such changes lead to market participation by overseas investors. France has a higher percentage than
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0715">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>371</span>
Britain—around 20 per cent.—of its outstanding debt owned by foreign institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change is significant and will elevate the United Kingdom from being top of the second league of international sovereign bond markets into the first division. It will do so because many substantial participants internationally—be they savings institutions or banking intermediaries—have been reluctant to become involved in the UK, partly because of the lack of liquidity of particular issues in the gilts market, but also because of the relative inflexibility of not having an open gilt repo system. I have no doubt that many who have already expressed an interest will want to become engaged in the market when it is set up. All the evidence elsewhere theoretically suggests that we shall benefit, perhaps substantially, from the change and thereby save the taxpayer a great deal of money. There should be a positive sum gain and everyone should win. It should promote confidence and make the market more efficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central referred to an article in today's 
	<i>Financial Times</i> which, I must admit—as is not unusual for that paper—was fairly well informed. That article referred to several issues such as withholding tax and the auction calender overseas settlement. On the latter issue, discussions with Euroclear and CEDEL are continuing and it is hoped that links with the Central gilts office will be established at or shortly after the establishment of the repo market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not able to say today, in the context of the clause, much about the other issues. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor announced, we have been undertaking a fundamental review of the management of British debt to ensure that we are up to date with best practices elsewhere in a fast-moving, substantial and evolving market and that we are getting the finest funding available on behalf of the taxpayer. Officials are engaged in substantial studies at home and abroad. They have examined systems elsewhere to find out whether we can improve confidence and certainty in and the efficiency of the market place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Considerable work still needs to be done both within the Treasury and through proper and careful consultation outside before any changes are decided upon or announced. It would be premature and improper for me to do so today. Those important technical issues preoccupy the market and may save us considerable sums of money if we get them right. We should proceed thoroughly and carefully before announcing preliminary conclusions in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While there is a spread of views in the market about such issues as certainty, settlement procedures, tax matters and how some people stand to benefit more than others, many have pressed publicly for some changes. I cannot comment on such matters other than to say that the establishment of an open gilt repo market is an important change. Of all the changes which should eat into that premium—which, I suspect, we have to pay for because of a less efficient market rather than anything to do with a Labour Government's record on the inflationary front—
	<span class='label label-info column'>372</span>
it will be well received and will have a substantial, beneficial impact in that aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington was courteous and generous in his remarks. He made the point that businesses can move elsewhere. That issue is crucial. Capital is flighty and business is mobile. We must not assume that the City of London or financial services centres elsewhere in the UK hold some magical attraction. If our costs are too high, our regulation too onerous and our fiscal regime too complex, others will find an easy haven through modern technology elsewhere in the world. We need to wise up to such issues and we need to keep not only the City of London but our great UK financial services industry ahead of the game and competition in such respects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need carefully to consider the nature of our interest in such industries. It used to be only so-called British firms, but nowadays many firms in Britain are owned by foreign firms and many such firms bring much employment to the UK and many have moved their headquarters to the UK. That is the best possible endorsement so far that we appear to be getting it right. Enormous liquidity is being attracted to the new markets—the derivatives, the swaps markets, the foreign exchange markets and now, we hope, the gilt repo market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All such matters are generally beneficial but we should not be complacent. We must ensure that the attraction of our markets is built on a fair and free reputation and not a bucket-shop, cut-regulation, cut-tax regime for false reasons. The enduring qualities of the London market—its human skills as much as its regulatory and fiscal regimes—will ensure that business continues to thrive successfully and to attract an increasing amount of inward investment. The change announced today will help ensure that such business stays onshore and that UK markets are kept free and up to date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington said, it is important that, in making such changes, we consult carefully with the market participants. We are trying to do that but there are dangers. All members of the Committee will know of occasions when the Treasury has sought to consult and has set fear in the hearts of people that has prevented responsible changes from taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With what is essentially a somewhat secretive Department, there is always a balance to be struck in not mooting substantial changes before they are necessary. Equally, when they are complex and impinge directly on the future investment, profitability and activities of existing companies, it is right and proper for us to seek outside views. My officials try to do so on matters such as this and others. By that means we hope that, at the end of the day, we present the Committee with more refined legislation than would otherwise be the case. We do not always get it right, but we endeavour to do so. I hope and believe that both clause 71 and the announcement I have made today follow those principles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for having made a full statement. It was much better than the usual answer to a written parliamentary question made on a Friday afternoon, and the Minister and his colleagues might want to bear that in mind when making future announcements. As always, when a Minister makes a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0716">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>373</span>
useful statement there is not a journalist to be seen. No doubt that will be set right by the Treasury press release this afternoon. I hope that it will be made available to members of the Committee. I cannot see why it should not be made available, especially if it fills the gaps to which the Minister referred. Certainly, I should like a copy, even if no one else would.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to follow the points made by the Minister and the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington from the point where the Minister left off, which is the importance of London, especially in the context of competition, regulation and tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are highly aware of those matters. We live in a global economy. The financial services industry is highly mobile and it does not have to be here. It is here largely because it grew off the back of the British empire and it is still here despite the performance of the home economy in recent years—not only the past 16 years, but the past 50 years. Because of the nature of the industry, it does not have to be located in London. Clearly it is important that Parliament recognises that potential mobility when considering matters of tax and regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the fact that the industry employs 2.5 million people and contributes 18 per cent. of this country's gross domestic product, it is vital that we keep it here. We are not in a buyers' market as far as industry is concerned. If we have something that we are good at, we should think long and hard before doing anything that might drive it offshore or to other countries. The Minister is right to say that several financial institutions have chosen to locate themselves here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington mentioned Edinburgh. A great part of the Scottish financial service industry exists entirely independent of Scotland, managing money that is raised from all over the world and investing it all over the world—it just happens to be based in Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said all that, I want to make one point about regulation. I have never argued, and never will argue, for more regulation for its own sake. At times, less strict regulation can be more effective than more strict regulation. That is certainly the case with the Personal Investment Authority's regime. In this case I was not arguing for more regulation; I simply wanted to be sure that there was some.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My concern arose because many Conservative Members take the bucket-shop view of regulation and tax—a view that is not shared by the Minister, hence his being kept out of office for 18 years under previous Prime Ministers. The Minister's views differ from those held by many in the mid-1980s in that he has a very responsible attitude to the question of regulation and associated matters. Although we have our differences, we are heading in more or less the same direction. I was therefore pleased to hear that there will be further developments in regulation. It would be helpful to be told about them as and when they are formulated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apparently, new clauses are to be tabled, but there cannot be many new clauses dealing with regulatory matters without the Budget resolution being changed—the general resolutions would not allow it. When we deal with new clauses—perhaps it was a hint that we should make swifter progress and so allow time to accommodate all those new clauses—we may debate these matters
	<span class='label label-info column'>374</span>
further, especially the question of regulation and the other systems to which the Minister referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the minister to answer two questions. I did not wish to cross examine him during his speech. First, now that the consultative period has ended, is it intended that the response to the Bank of England's consultative document should be published? If so, when will it be published, because it might make interesting reading? Similarly, if the Government intend to publish anything, when will that be made available?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Minister announced that gross payments would be made on gilts. What effect will that have on Treasury receipts? It will affect timing and I noted that the Minister said that quarterly accounting would be practised. Will there be any effect on the timing of Treasury tax receipts? It was always thought that, in the first year or so, the Treasury would have to bear increased costs, which would be ironed out as the system came into operation. It would be useful if the hon. Gentleman could tell us what assessment the Government have made of the costs. Presumably, quarterly accounting is a method of getting around the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the Minister considers those questions, I should like to make a point about volatility. It is the Government's practice to write off the past 16 years and to concentrate on the past year or so, and to suggest that the present Government came into office at an unspecified time after the country left the European exchange rate mechanism. As the ERM was the cornerstone of the economic policy on which the present Government fought the last election, it is not surprising that some clear water—whether it is blue or not—needs to be put between the events of September 1992 and the present day. The Minister cannot pretend that, if this country is paying a heavy price in terms of interest rates, that price is being paid only in respect of events that culminated in May 1979, and that nothing has happened for the past 16 years. That is nonsense, as the Minister will recognise. We are still paying the price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise what the Chancellor says he is trying to do in terms of price stability, which is an important matter. If we have low inflation, it is incumbent on all of us to ensure that it persists. But as last week's figures show, it is too early to start celebrating on that front.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the hon. Gentleman misunderstanding the important relationship between the exchange rate mechanism and interest rates? In fact, when a country is a member of an exchange rate mechanism that has narrow bands that are rigorously enforced, it is more likely to result in interest rate volatility because something has to give. Conversely, a looser mechanism is less likely to cause interest rate volatility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that this is the appropriate time to debate the merits or otherwise of a rigid exchange rate mechanism. We may return to the subject, although judging by the Government's present performance we are unlikely to do so in the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I certainly take issue with the Minister's assertion that, if any penalty is being paid, it is being paid for alleged offences committed by a previous generation. The Government must answer for the events of the past 16 years.

	<span class='label label-info column'>375</span>
I thank the Minister for his helpful statement. It is an important development and one that we broadly support. Nevertheless, we are right to flag some general concerns. I hope that, before we move on to clause 72, the Minister can tell us whether there is to be any publication of the results of the consultation and also about costs for the Exchequer. Other matters can wait until we discuss other clauses, or the new clauses to which the Minister referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bank of England will publish a paper in March that will deal with a range of detailed technical issues raised in response to its consultative paper. It will include drafts of the standard legal agreement and codes of best practice that are currently being drawn up by working parties of market participants. The proposed start date for the market will be confirmed at that time, after the Bank of England has consulted market participants about the systems implications of the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the important issue of the cashflow cost of the changes proposed, there will be an overall loss of tax. No one's tax liability is being reduced, only deferred. The tuning of tax collection will be affected, which we estimate will add about £100 million to the public sector borrowing requirement in 1995–96, but it is expected to have a negligible effect in future years. The benefit will be the lower cost of debt to the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should make it clear that, had we decided instead to introduce gross payment of dividends on gilts without the proposed system of quarterly accounting and with the addition of payment in the middle of March, before the end of the financial year, the cashflow costs would have been considerably more than £100 million. Our estimate is that they would have been £850 million in the first year. I hope that the Committee will understand, as professional commentators outside will undoubtedly understand, that we were comparing a cashflow cost on one side with an enormous financial benefit on the other, in terms of the lower cost of financing our national debt and debt issuance. That should more than make up for the initial cashflow costs. Although a headline figure is involved, it is an accounting and cashflow figure. No real extra money is involved. The benefits will be real, even if they will not be quantifiable in terms of the lower cost which will have to be paid as interest on debt issuance later in the day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be pleased to try to explain. There will not be a cost. The clause will disapply the bond-
	<span class='label label-info column'>376</span>
washing provisions from certain agreements for the sale and repurchase of securities—repos—that we have just discussed. The bond-washing provisions apply to equities and securities outside the accrued income scheme that we considered when we discussed the previous clause. The provisions are designed to prevent people turning income into capital, for example, by selling equities just before a dividend is due to be paid so that the dividend is received by the buyer. The original holder would then get the value of the dividend as part of the price paid for the equity rather than as income. That is prevented by denying the buyer relief for the loss resulting from subsequently selling the equity at a lower price after the dividend has been paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under a repo, the equity or security is sold back to the original holder at a price agreed at the outset. That usually means that the interest or dividend remains with the original holder in the form of a manufactured payment representative of the real interest or dividend made by the other party to the repo. No bond washing has occurred and therefore the bond-washing provisions are inappropriate. The clause removes that anomaly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In order to discuss clause 73 we need to return briefly to some of the issues canvassed when we debated clause 71. Some supervision will be necessary simply because of the operation of the Inland Revenue in stock lending. Changes are being made again to facilitate an open market, and one or two questions arise from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a recent article—I cannot tell the Committee where it appeared—someone speaking on behalf of the Institutional Fund Managers Association said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Bank of England, together with the Inland Revenue, has done a fantastic job in establishing a regulatory scheme for stock lending. If that scheme is applied, as it must be, the procedures are wholly safe."</p></blockquote>
That is very interesting. What is that fantastic regulatory scheme? Will it be revised as a result of the anticipated changes proposed in the clause?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An article in the 
	<i>Financial Times</i> in November last year discussed stock lending. One of the more infamous stock lenders was a man called Maxwell—some would refer to his actions as stock stealing. Taking advantage of the delays in the system, he was able to "lend" stock to his various companies in order to prop up their balance sheets. That is a regulatory issue. The article observed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One of the limiting factors is the heavy regulatory system which the Inland Revenue originally imposed to plug possible tax loopholes."</p></blockquote>
The Government's thrust is, so they say, deregulatory. As a result of the provisions in the clause, will we have a lighter regulatory touch and will there be a change to the safeguards which would otherwise apply?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It occurred to me that, as we move towards more instant settlement of share transactions, the market will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0718">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>377</span>
become more open. The problem now is that our moves towards a more instantaneous settlement system have been fraught with difficulties with the collapse of TAURUS. Although CREST is coming along, when will it be operational? The settlement time is being reduced to five days, which will help to open the market. Before we endorse the clause, we are entitled to ensure that there are safeguards. I am not asking for more complicated legislation or more complicated regulation, but numerous commentators have referred to the fantastic regulatory regime—what is so fantastic about it and will it be changed when the provisions are implemented?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could say a word or two about the narrower importance of the clause which will provide enabling cash as a collateral in repo cases. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central asked about stock lending, which I shall come to. There is an inhibition on the extent to which certain repo activities and stock lending activities can be undertaken through the effect on cash held as collateral. The clause deals with mat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Arrangements for regulation of stock lending are governed by rules in both the banking system and the Financial Services Act 1986 which regulate and control. However, they do not directly relate to the clause and the attached schedule which facilitate the use of cash as collateral for approved stock lending arrangements. Difficulties arise from the tax treatment of interest on the cash. The changes to the treatment of interest earned on cash collateral will remove those difficulties and enable lenders who prefer to use cash as collateral, rather than other securities, to take a more active part in the market. Lenders normally receive a stock lending fee in return for making their stock available. In addition, they receive a return on the collateral that they hold, the benefit of which is usually passed back to the borrower.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new provisions apply to situations in which the lender earns interest on the gross of tax and pays the same amount to the borrower as rebate interest. Any stock lending fee passing from the borrower to the lender will have to be identified separately. In those circumstances, interest arising to the lender on the cash will be treated as the income of the borrower. To ensure that the borrower is not also taxed on the rebate interest itself, the rebate interest is disregarded. That also short circuits the tax difficulties for the lender. The measures have been developed in consultation with the stock lending community and are welcomed as a useful freeing up of the workings of the market place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise some points for clarification. What is the projected yield from the measures? Is there a differential impact between the tax treatment of cash as collateral and, for example, of short-term talisman certificates? I am nervous about the regulatory mechanism and perhaps the Inland Revenue could be a means by which the regulatory mechanism could be underlined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can reassure the hon. Lady that that is not so. No cost will be involved in the provisions. Under the arrangements for stock lending, if one party lends stock to another, the other party may provide collateral for that stock being lent. If that collateral is in the form of cash and interest is paid on that cash, it can be taxed in the hands of the lender, but the
	<span class='label label-info column'>378</span>
lender must pay to the borrower the interest on the cash and it will be taxed again in his hands. The problem is that there may be double taxation of the same interest. That has prevented the use of cash as collateral for such lending operations. As a result, such activity has not taken off substantially. People often use other securities as collateral against the lending of stock and the problem does not arise. The problem arises only when cash is used as collateral and many market participants have rightly asked why cash collateral should be inhibited in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause ensures that interest is taxed only once if that is appropriate. In so doing, it will liberalise or free up the market to enable lending against cash collateral to take place. It is a relief which may facilitate new activity, but no cost is involved because no income is received in that form at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I revert to the regulatory system for stock lending. Approval of all parties to stock-lending chains must be obtained by the Revenue if tax disadvantages are to be avoided. Stock exchange rules also apply to stock lending. I agree with the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central that following the disturbing Maxwell case, the public and professional practitioners are entitled to be concerned and reassured. The Government and the regulatory bodies should re-examine from time to time the rules for stock lending to ensure that they are secure, that they are rule of integrity and that they are not open to abuse by diversion or the creation of securities. Sadly, there will probably always be miscreants in the market place who will try to find ways around any rules, but I am persuaded that the regulatory structure—I am dunking particularly of supervision by the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation and the Bank of England—includes careful restrictions and restraints on stock lending to ensure that they are transactions of integrity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Its chairman was one of the few people who behaved correctly and, with great credit to himself, resigned, although he was not the only one who should have done so. In view of IMRO's responsibility and the importance that the Minister attaches to it, what is being done to make it less likely that that sort of thing does not happen again?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of changes in supervision by the regulatory body and in regulation by SIB were instituted to firm up and reassure the markets and participants.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, stock that is currently used as collateral must be lodged. How can we ensure that the cash being used as collateral exists?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Companies could mount audit trails. Those are often private contractual matters between participating institutions and banks and, as such, it is for the parties to decide on the collateral or security against stock lending. Their accounting methods should prove or demonstrate the security of the procedures. They are subject to the supervisory process that I described and the Revenue may also want to be satisfied about who holds the collateral or principal stocks because that may give rise to tax liabilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still extremely concerned about the concept of cash as collateral because, ironically, it is more ephemeral than share certificates. I understand the Minister's point on auditing, but auditing is retrospective and the money could have flown the nest by the time an audit takes place. As a Maxwell pensioner, I speak with some feeling on the matter—I have some background and experience in trying to untangle the sort of maze that can be created.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge with sympathy the hon. Lady's interest in the matter, but all audits are historic in that they look at what has happened. They require a firm to account for what has taken place and to account to others for their tax liability. Problems should not arise with cash that is used as collateral for stock lending any more than collateral in the form of securities. At present, a double taxation anomaly prevents cash from being used as collateral. Cash may often be the most convenient or appropriate collateral for an institution to provide against stock lending, perhaps if it has a short position in other securities which it does not want to use for collateral. The change is not fraught with new risks. It should liberalise and, to a modest extent, make the market more efficient. It is a change that responds to calls from the market place to facilitate its transactions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central referred to CREST. I do not want to test your patience, Mr. Winterton, on the remit of the clause, except to say that CREST is the proposed settlement system that is being worked up by the Bank of England for paperless transactions in equities. With the reduction in settlement days from 10 to five, we hope that that will come on stream. It does not directly impinge on the clause, but I should like to take the opportunity to tell the hon. Gentleman that I take a close interest in the development of the CREST system. I want to ensure that individual shareholders continue to have the option of retaining certificates directly in companies. I am also anxious to ensure that, where they do not do so and an interest is held through a nominee, there are mechanisms to ensure that they obtain reports from companies and that there is direct communication between companies and shareholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are only a couple of the guidelines that we have given to the Bank of England on creating a new system, which we hope, while not being all-singing and all-dancing, will provide for an efficient and effective paperless transfer system for the future. However, strictly speaking that is without the terms of the clause. When we introduce the necessary regulations for CREST, which, I
	<span class='label label-info column'>380</span>
believe, will be subject to affirmative resolution, we shall have an opportunity to consider those matters in depth, as I am sure the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central will appreciate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

All I shall say to the Minister on the question of cash is that I appreciate that there will be audit trails. Indeed, I may be wrong, but I think that the Serious Fraud Office is still trying to pursue audit trails.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Hopefully the matter will never arise, but the Government are put on notice that there is concern about cash being used as collateral. Clearly, it is not our job as primary legislators to draw up such rules and regulations, but I hope that the Minister will insist that regulators—whom we appoint to look after the public interest—ensure that the rules and regulations are adequate. I accept that it is a private contractual matter, but the integrity of the financial system is a matter of public interest. That is why mere are regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to echo the concerns expressed by the Law Society about the clause and about subsection (6) in particular. The definition of beneficiaries is intended to relate not only to actual but to potential beneficiaries. As the Law Society pointed out in relation to discretionary trusts, that could mean that, as most of them will have the power to alter a particular class of beneficiaries, United Kingdom residents could be brought within the scope of that definition and, therefore, the trustees of such a discretionary trust might be inclined to move their business from UK banks to offshore institutions. That would be undesirable because UK financial institutions would lose business. I therefore suggest that my right hon.

	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Sir George Young)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill), and touched on by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central, which is the concern expressed by the Law Society that the legislation is too widely drawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition of beneficiaries extends only to people who, at the time the definition is applied, are identified as beneficiaries under the terms of the particular trust deed. Trustees are specifically authorised by section 481(5)(k)(iii) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 to make a declaration to have bank interest paid gross provided that, at the time, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that any of the identified beneficiaries of the trust is an individual who is ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom or a company that is resident in the UK. The scenario suggested by my hon. Friend—that a UK resident might, at some time, be made a beneficiary—is something that the trustees must take into account and need not concern him. The fact that an addition may, subsequently, be made to the class of beneficiaries is no bar to the trustees making the declaration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central asked about administrative arrangements. The Inland Revenue will notify those trustees, probably when it sends out the returns for the current year, that they need to make a declaration to the bank to operate the new system of paying gross. New accounts will not be affected. They will operate on a gross basis from inception. Against that background, I hope that the Committee will approve the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful if I said something about the clause in general. It introduces new rules for dealing with thinly capitalised companies. Thin capitalisation is the process of financing subsidiaries with greater amounts of debt, in comparison with equity, than would be expected between persons dealing at arm's
	<span class='label label-info column'>382</span>
length. Because interest payments, unlike dividend payments, can be deducted in calculating taxable profits, that can result in a significant reduction in tax paid. The new rules will provide for more consistent treatment of such thinly capitalised companies than has been possible hitherto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present approach to thin capitalisation involves a combination of domestic law and our tax treaties. Such treaties differ and, consequently, the law's impact on thinly capitalised companies varies depending on the precise interaction between domestic law and the treaty concerned. In many cases, the law enables the Inland Revenue to treat the part of the interest paid by a thinly capitalised company that exceeds what would be expected between companies dealing at arm's length as if it were a dividend. In some cases, however, the whole of the interest will be treated in that way even if none of it is excessive. In other cases, none of it will be so treated even if all of it is excessive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new rules will enable an arm's-length approach to be applied generally to thinly capitalised companies making payments of interest and similar sums to certain categories of associated companies. The clause provides that, in such cases, the part of the payment that exceeds what would have been paid at arm's length will be treated as if it were a dividend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such cases, the part of the payment that exceeds what would have been paid at arm's length will be treated as if it were a dividend. It outlines factors which are to be taken into account in determining whether, or to what extent, payments are excessive. It also makes it clear that this arm's length approach is to be applied in the context of the United Kingdom grouping, of which the thinly capitalised company is a member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many cases payments are made between associated companies in circumstances which give little or no scope for avoidance of United Kingdom tax because the deduction is matched by a corresponding taxable receipt. The clause therefore ensures that the new rules do not apply when the recipient of the payment is within the charge to corporation tax in respect of the sum. That is intended to minimise any unnecessary compliance burden for groups of companies and to target the legislation on situations which give rise to the possibility of tax avoidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause applies to interest and also to similar payments such as discounts. It will apply generally to payments made after 29 November 1994, except in cases where the Inland Revenue had issued a notice before that date authorising payments to be made either without any income tax being withheld or at a reduced rate of withholding, in accordance with the relevant tax treaty provision. In such cases, only payments made after 31 March 1995 will be affected. Holders of notices whose existing funding arrangements are newly affected will have an opportunity to amend those arrangements to correspond to the arm's-length principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the Government amendments, certain payments of interest and similar sums between connected parties are treated as distributions to the extent that the payment would not have been made if the companies had been unconnected. The clause provides for a let-out from that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0721">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>383</span>
treatment if the recipient is within the charge to corporation tax in respect of the sum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Charities cannot take advantage of that let-out, but had been thought to be otherwise excluded from liability. It is not apparent that, as a result of limitations on the way in which charities' assets can be applied, an unintended liability might arise in some cases in which charities were in receipt of interest payments by their subsidiaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would ensure that payments which would otherwise be distributions by virtue of the new provisions that I have just mentioned shall not be so treated when the payment is to a charity as defined in section 506 of the Taxes Act, or to any of the other bodies mentioned in section 507. I know that the change will be welcomed by the voluntary sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like other members of the Committee, Mr. Winterton, you have probably spent many hours looking at the clause and trying to deduce the precise implications of the wording. My right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary spent some time trying to explain the principles of the clause when he spoke to his amendments, but the wording
	<span class='label label-info column'>384</span>
goes into a depth of complexity rarely seen even in the Taxes Act 1988. Representations have been made by the Law Society, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Institute of Taxation and the Institute of Directors, all of which are complaining about the complexity of the provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That complexity and the poor draftsmanship of the clause add weight to the suggestion by my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the private sector should be involved in the drafting of clauses. I am sure that the private sector could have made a much better job of this clause. Hon. Members may wonder why such concerns are so important, but this is the first piece of tax legislation that an overseas investor would be faced with when considering whether to invest in the United Kingdom or elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I advise the hon. Gentleman that he is going rather wide of his amendment. He appears to be indulging in a clause stand part debate. He may have heard the tell the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding that he should leave his remarks until the clause stand part debate. Will the hon. Gentleman please relate his remarks specifically to the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My remarks were leading on to the amendment because I believe that the Committee should have some understanding of the problems created by the clause, which he behind my reasons for tabling the amendment. I want to explain the significant problems a little further and explain why the amendment is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions of the Bill are important to overseas investors—not just those who might wish to invest in the United Kingdom in future, but those with current investments in the United Kingdom. Under the amendment, companies that had already obtained clearance from the Inland Revenue would be given more time to ensure that their financial arrangements and the structuring of their businesses in the United Kingdom accord with the changes set out in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three types of investor will be affected. The first group comprises those who have invested under the terms of a double-taxation treaty with the United Kingdom which did not contain provisions covering thin capitalisation—provisions relating to interest rates and the fact that they are set at market values. That includes Japanese and German investors, who are very important to this country. A whole range of important investors with existing investments in the United Kingdom have structured their businesses and decided on their debt equity relationship, but now that structure will be thrown into doubt. Under subsection (8) they will be required to obtain a further clearance from the Inland Revenue before 1 April 1995.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second category comprises existing UK groups in which the holding company is a UK resident company which has not previously been caught by thin capitalisation provisions. A United Kingdom holding company that has an overseas financing company beneath it and has previously obtained clearance for double taxation relief on interest paid within its group will now need to make sure that it seeks a further clearance from the Inland Revenue before 1 April 1995.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other important issue relating to clause 75 concerns the redefinition of group structures. The clause introduces a new system for defining group structures. It means that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0722">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>385</span>
for all those companies that have previously obtained clearances, if their group structure does not comply with the previous clearance and if the new provisions affect their group structure, they will have to apply for clearance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Inland Revenue has estimated that approximately 1,000 companies will be affected by the changes and must apply for clearances by 1 April 1995. I have had several discussions with professional firms which have many clients who have invested in the United Kingdom and they are confident that the number of overseas investors in the United Kingdom who will be affected by these provisions and who will have to seek clearance will be substantially greater than that estimated by the Inland Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I question whether the Inland Revenue will be able to cope during the next six weeks and give the necessary clearances. I wonder whether all those companies in the United Kingdom that have invested here—and Ministers of the Crown say they are so pleased that they invested in the United Kingdom—and which will be fully aware of the implications of the clause, will obtain their clearance by 1 April 1995.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment would provide a longer period for consideration and for overseas business operating in this country to get their clearances from the Inland Revenue. I suggest that 30 November 1996 would be a more suitable date. There is a precedent for such a time period being provided for companies to restructure their affairs. In 1987, when changes were made to double taxation relief on interest on certain overseas loans, the Inland Revenue allowed a period of two years for companies to obtain their clearances and to restructure their affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we consider making this change to the timetable. We must recognise that major investors—for example, Japanese companies that have invested in this country—that have a particular type of debt structure will have to obtain clearance and, quite possibly, change their debt structure by 1 April 1995, which is only six weeks away. Some of those companies will have financed their businesses from their parent companies overseas on medium or fixed-term loans and they will be faced with the dilemma of having structures that are no longer acceptable to the Inland Revenue under the terms of the treaty. They may find that they can no longer claim the interest relief in the United Kingdom and that it will be treated as a dividend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to reconsider this matter and reflect on whether he should allow inward investors time in which to sort out their affairs in a more orderly fashion, without disruption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. Before the hon. Gentleman moved his amendment we had no means of knowing what he would say, or why he was moving it. We now have a clearer idea and it is quite obvious that he is addressing the merits of the clause as being a reason for seeking a deferral of its implementation date. You said, at my prompting, that we would have a clause stand part debate, so there is no point in having two half goes at it. I have a short speech to make, which I can make either on the amendment or on clause stand part. I do not want to have to speak on both. It strikes me that the Financial Secretary will now have to respond to the merits of the clause, not just the narrow point of the amendment.
	<span class='label label-info column'>386</span>
I am in your hands, Mr. Winterton, but I think that the Committee wants one debate on the clause, not two. It might be useful to know when that debate is to take place. I suspect I speak also for the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding in this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a further point of order, Mr. Wiinterton. I tailored my remarks in accordance with your guidance and spoke only to my specific amendment. I planned to make several further points on the clause in general and highlight other deficiencies during a clause stand part debate, which you said would take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be for the convenience and ease of the Committee if I say that I hope that hon. Members will debate the amendment in accordance with its substance. I am happy also to permit a clause stand part debate. If hon. Members wish to comment on the amendment, I should be happy—indeed, it is my duty—to call them, but in the absence of any hon. Member rising, I shall call the Financial Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to respond to the amendment as narrowly as possible, dealing with the case made by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Mr. Legg) but without covering ground more suited to the clause stand part debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To the charge of bringing forward a complex clause, I have to plead guilty in this case. It is complex, but so is the subject with which it deals. We are trying to level the playing field for inward investment and to provide for greater equality of treatment for all companies. We are repealing a short, but potentially harsh piece of legislation and replacing it with something which is, admittedly, longer and more complex, but which avoids harshness by focusing on what would have been agreed between independent persons acting at arm's length. That is a concept which, sadly, involves some drafting complexity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning specifically to amendment No. 191, as I said when I spoke briefly about the purport of the clause, it is intended to leave the position of the majority of investors unchanged. My hon. Friend's amendment would make no practical difference in most cases. However, the amendment would delay the introduction of an effective defence against thin capitalisation, where the investment comes from one of 12 countries with which our tax treaty does not at present enable such an approach to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is designed to achieve its objectives with the minimum possible delay. That is why it applies generally from 29 November 1994. But—and these are the cases to which my hon. Friend referred—where an existing loan had previously been considered by the Inland Revenue, a later date of 1 April 1995 is provided for. This four-month period is intended to give most investors time to consider the draft clause—which was made available on Budget day—and be reassured that, in practice, it does not change their position. Such a period of time is more than sufficient for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause could make a difference to the tax treatment of a small number of existing loans. My advice is that 500 companies might be affected, but they would be affected only if they had structured specific deals in a way that was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0723">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>387</span>
caught by the thin capitalisation rules. The investment would have to have been made from one of a dozen countries, of which Japan is one, where the rules already applying to most inward investments have not previously operated. Even then, only in cases where investment from those countries had been structured in a way that breached the arm's-length principle would the clause bite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those cases the four-month delay in applying the legislation has given time for the effects of the clause to be considered and, where necessary, discussed with the Inland Revenue. It has also given time for any financial restructuring, about which I shall speak shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle beneficiaries of my hon. Friend's amendment would be a small number of lenders who have taken advantage of the uneven application of the former rules to structure investment in the United Kingdom in a tax-aggressive manner that is not open to most of their competitors. Anomalies and inconsistencies of treatment of that sort are precisely what the clause is intended to remove as speedily as possible. My hon. Friend's amendment would unnecessarily delay that result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend rightly said, and I do not dissent, that we want to attract inward investment and we have been highly successful in that. Most inward investment has come from countries to which the regime that will now apply to Japan and others already applies. The clause will no longer give unduly favourable treatment to investment from those 12 countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of what my hon. Friend said, I will ensure that discussions between the Inland Revenue and any of the companies affected will proceed as speedily as possible. Only a very few companies will be affected—those that have already breached the arm's-length principle in structuring their inward investment. It is worth saying in passing that Japan has rules on thin capitalisation which will affect United Kingdom groups. What we are doing will equalise treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend will not press his amendment. I will see whether there are genuine difficulties in restructuring groups by 1 April and I will ensure that the Inland Revenue is as helpful as possible. It is quite simple to restructure because the organisations are within a common group. I believe that the four-month period to allow such thinly capitalised companies to restructure is wholly adequate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to press my amendment, but I want to comment further on what my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary said. He referred to Japan and the fact that it has arm's-length provision. However, the Japanese tax authorities provide very clear guidance on acceptable financial structure. The Inland Revenue and our tax structure do not do that. We are behind Japan in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary has underestimated the number of companies involved. I am pleased that the Inland Revenue will take further soundings because quite a large number of businesses that have invested in the United Kingdom will be affected and, in some cases, major restructuring of their financial arrangements may be required. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We support, in general, what the Government are trying to do and our point of concern is similar to that raised by the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Mr. Legg) and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome what the Government are doing, but it is necessary to have greater certainty for foreign companies. Knowing exactly where they stand before the tax authorities is a fundamental point of tax law. It is a matter that the Institute for Fiscal Studies—and its specialist committee, of which I am a member—is considering. There is a creeping tendency on the part of the Revenue to leave tax matters for discussion so that taxpayers do not know where they stand. When framing tax legislation we should bear in mind the old maxim of rendering
	<br><blockquote><p>"unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's",</p></blockquote>
no more and no less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not clear where the difficulties will arise. New subsection (8A) refers to a "relevant connection". That leaves considerable scope for doubt. New subsection (8B) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the appropriate level or extent of the issuing company's overall indebtedness".</p></blockquote>
That also leaves a lot of scope for doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The result is likely to be a Dutch auction. Taxpayers will put in a bid at one end of the scale, the Revenue will put in a bid at the other end, and they will probably settle somewhere in-between. If this is intended to be a deregulatory measure, it is a curious one and I wonder whether the Government could do more to provide clearer guidelines on how "appropriate level" or "relevant connection" are likely to be defined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same problem arises in new subsection (8D), which refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"no effective 51 per cent. subsidiaries".</p></blockquote>
What is effective? We should not be in the business of creating opportunities for lawyers and accountants to make a lot of money, nor should we incur taxpayers in great expense to find out what should be obvious—
	<i>[Laughter.]</i> I do not know why hon. Members find that amusing; I have not practised law for years. My hon. Friend the Member for Ashfield might do well to hold his peace in case I make some uncomradely remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When legislating, it is important to provide clarity and certainty and not to leave too much open for discussion. I accept that anomalies exist in this country's double taxation treaties. For example, German and Japanese companies may be worse off as a result of the changes, but Irish and Luxembourg-based companies may be better off. When changes are made to the tax regime transitional problems are bound to arise, and I shall not argue about that. I am concerned about the lack of certainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry complains that it was not consulted, so my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) embarked on a consultation exercise and wrote to some companies. I shall not reveal who they are because they might not appreciate that. One multinational oil company wrote to say that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"new clause does nothing to bring certainty to the fiscal arrangements of the UK subsidiaries of overseas parents"—</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0724">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>389</span>
and,
	<br><blockquote><p>"does not reduce the need to agree with the Revenue whether the borrowing terms are arm's length … The measure does not go to the heart of the question of thin capitalisation which typically is resolved by companies through negotiations with the Inland Revenue."</p></blockquote>
There will be negotiation and, a great deal of paperwork and discussion. We shall spend the next two years clarifying the law not in terms of primary legislation or even rules and regulations made under secondary legislation, but in Inland Revenue practice. Therefore, we are entitled to a ministerial statement which can be relied upon following the doctrine of Pepper 
	<i>v.</i> Hart, so that taxpayers can have some idea of what Parliament intends. Another industrial company based in Britain drew attention to the fact there is no certainty. Interestingly, a Japanese multinational company raised various concerns along the same lines and stated that the approach of the Inland Revenue
	<br><blockquote><p>"could result in foreign direct investment being diverted from the UK."</p></blockquote>
I appreciate that it is not uncommon for taxpayers to take the view that if anything is changed they will go elsewhere—we had that experience with oil taxation—but in fact they do not. Such threats must be treated with healthy scepticism. Equally, the assertion by the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West that the private sector should draw up legislation is a little far fetched. If, as taxpayers, we drew up our own legislation, none of us would pay any tax. We must be careful about that, although I tend to agree with the general thrust of the hon. Gentleman's argument that taxpayers should have a degree of certainty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central has poured scorn on the concept that the private sector could draft clauses for Taxes Acts. That is a strange comment from a member of the legal profession. I thought that the legal profession treated all its clients equally. I am sure that members of that profession would be affronted if it was thought that they could not give the Government as good a service as they provide to their other clients. The hon. Gentleman also did a gross disservice to parliamentary draftsmen. His comments implied that they would be unable to cross-check legislation that was drafted by the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, that is a silly point. One of the great attributes of a legal training is the ability to see not only the client's case, but the opponent's case. I accept that many people in the private sector, whether tax practitioners or taxpayers, may make constructive suggestions as to the practicabilities of what the Government are doing, but at the end of the day the Government must take a dispassionate view of what they are trying to do. As the Minister will no doubt remind the hon. Gentleman, the Government must bear two aims in mind: to make the tax system simple and to make it effective so that the Government maximise their revenue. For the life of me, I cannot think what motivated the hon. Gentleman to make such a silly debating point. However, I know that the Committee wants to make progress so we need not bother ourselves further with what he had to say.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Financial Secretary replies, will he give us some clarity or certainty about the Government's
	<span class='label label-info column'>390</span>
intentions? At present, a casual examination of clause 75 suggests that an awful lot of work will be created in the public and private sector by trying to introduce a new corpus of tax law on this matter and I do not think that that is a desirable way in which to develop legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree very much with several comments in our debate. I strongly agree in particular with the criticisms of the text. I do not accept that it is because the clause deals with a matter of complexity. It is worse than that—it is a matter of bad drafting. The person who drafted the clause was either having a bad day or is inherendy incapable of the principles of logical thought. I invite the Committee to examine the structure of clause 75. The first line of the clause introduces section 209 of the Taxes Act 1988 and, in subsection (3) parts of section 808 A of the same Act are proposed to apply to that clause. With paragraphs (a) and (b), those provisions of section 808A that have been introduced into section 209 are themselves modified. In addition, there is the extraordinary point in paragraph (b) where, as part of that modification, "subsection (8B) below"—which we have yet to discuss—is disapplied. On reaching subsection (8B), we find that, in turn, that disapplies part of "subsection (8A)(b) above".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You, Mr. Winterton, are probably familiar with the famous poem of G. K. Chesterton which goes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Before the Roman to Rye or out to Severn strode,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The rolling English drunkard made the rolling English road."</p></blockquote>
It is evident that the rolling parliamentary draftsman has been at work on the Taxes Act, with extremely unsatisfactory results. Why introduce section 808A in such circumstances at all? Why not simply say what one means? To disapply two subsections of section 808A and then to disapply one of the disapplications of section 808A is completely cuckoo. If ever documentary evidence were required to support the extremely sensible suggestion of my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor that we should subject the parliamentary drafting of this Bill to competitive tendering or market testing, this provides such evidence and we should do that without further ado. It is not only unreasonable for the Committee but for the taxpayer to try to understand this nonsense. In this case, it is unreasonable to impose additional costs on those good enough to invest in this country by our interpretation of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter of great concern to me is the allegation by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South that there was no consultation before the measure was introduced. I find it hard to believe that accusation. It is a serious charge against the Revenue, which I believe now has a duty to consult whenever it introduces new tax proposals. I hope that my right hon. Friend can dismiss that serious allegation and assure us that the Revenue observed its obligations—which, I trust, it takes seriously—to consult, in particular with overseas investors that have been good enough to invest, which may invest further and which may bring colleagues from their own countries with them. It is not only a breach of that statutory obligation but a grave disservice to this country not to consult when legislation will have a material impact on the investment intentions of overseas investors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I am safe in assuming that there was a consultation exercise and that, not for the first time, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central is misinformed. What evidence came from that consultation exercise
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0725">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>391</span>
about the present practice of German and Japanese investors? I have those two countries in mind because the clause will have a negative impact on their investors in this country. They are important economies and important sources of overseas investment. How many investors from those two countries will be put offside by the provisions and will encounter new costs or difficulties?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that we have to accept the principle of thin capitalisation in our tax legislation. We have heard from the Financial Secretary that that exists in other countries and is necessary in order to avoid an obvious form of tax avoidance. I therefore accept it, as should the Committee, but with ill-grace and a great dose of scepticism. It is inherently obnoxious that the Revenue or any other part of the state should arrogate the right to determine an appropriate financial structure for any business in any sector of activity. That will depend on the inherent characteristics, the operational risk and the operational gearing of the business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a business is owned by a foreign multinational and is therefore consolidated into a large multinational grouping, it would be rational that the gearing should be that which is regarded by the parent as being appropriate for the worldwide business activity. We all know that other countries, for reasons that are justified in financial theory but into which we need not go now, have traditionally higher level gearing in all sectors of industry. Indeed, Germany and Japan can be used as examples of that. If we must have thin capitalisation, we should recognise that it is a burden on foreign investors and acts as a disincentive because it is a cost. We want to keep that cost and that disincentive to a minimum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Greater certainty is desirable. That is why I appreciate amendment No. 190, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West, which you, Mr. Winterton, in your wisdom, sadly did not select for debate. It would have introduced a new element of certainty into the determination of thin or appropriate capitalisation by the Revenue. Negotiation could have continued and lines could have been drawn—perimeters established—which would make it clear in advance that the issue of thin capitalisation would not arise. Such an assurance would be valuable when multinational companies are considering location investment decisions around the world. They consider cash flow projections, the assumptions on which those are made and the probability assumptions on which those assumptions are based. In so far as we can reduce uncertainty, all other things being equal, we will increase propensity to invest. Reducing uncertainty in tax is an important part of that process. The state can play a direct role in that which it cannot do in other factors determining location of investment decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that we have not debated the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, Southwest, but I am more sorry that the Government have not introduced a similar measure to reduce uncertainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I seek an assurance from my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary on one matter. There is uncertainty about the issue and few measures have been introduced to reduce that. The clause targets two countries from which we have received enormous overseas investment—Japan and Germany—and to which we should express a reasonable appreciation and gratitude.
	<span class='label label-info column'>392</span>
Given those facts, will my right hon. Friend give the Committee an assurance that the Revenue will be prepared, when discussing with future potential investors in the United Kingdom, to give a predetermination of the financial structure that it will accept, and which will be safe from any allegation of thin capitalisation? I have never understood why the Revenue finds it so hard to give predeterminations when the Internal Revenue Service has been giving predeterminations for years to anyone who asks for one. The Revenue has never got its act together on that matter. Will my right hon. Friend ensure that the Revenue gets its act together over thin capitalisation? Will he assure the Committee that clear, unambiguous instructions will be given to the Revenue to deal with that matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we discussed the standard rate of corporation tax, I said that inward investors were concerned about the rate of tax and the taxable base, to which the clause relates. It is regrettable that a clause that is so important to inward investors should be so complex and unintelligible. The Law Society has said that this is the first piece of United Kingdom tax law on which professional advisers have to advise foreign investors. Frankly, clause 75 is a pretty poor start. The Institute of Taxation, which comprises professionals who advise on taxation, has described the clause as being generally unintelligible, so it would be a mistake for the Committee simply to accept the clause. If that institute does not understand it, there is no hope for the average taxpayer or inward investor.

My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding described the complexity of the clause and asked about consultation. According to the Institute of Taxation, there was no consultation, which is probably part of the problem.
	<br><blockquote><p>"We believe that a number of the problems with this clause would have been avoided had there been consultation on it."</p></blockquote>
There are many parts in the Bill about which there has been consultation, and there is general agreement that the legislation to which we have agreed is satisfactory. When we discuss my proposed new clause 4, which would establish a tax law commission for the review of the simplification and modernisation of tax law, I shall make that point. For some reason that I do not understand, the clause seems to be an exception and I do not believe that we should proceed with it. We should have accepted one of the amendments that deferred its introduction, or we should ask my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to take it away and to bring it back in a more intelligible form.

My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, Southwest discussed the private sector and he seemed to be supporting the Chancellor's initiative of getting private sector people to help with drafting. The Parliamentary Counsel Office runs a monopoly operation, which does not seem to be too concerned about its customers. Given that it is a monopoly, that is not very surprising. If there were a bit of competition and other people offered to help with the drafting of legislation, there might be an improvement in the quality of the drafting. That is needed with clause 75.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

and for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central referred to the curious wording of the clause. I want to draw attention to the word "inference". I cannot recall that term being used in any of the Taxes Acts. Subsection 3(b) also uses the phrase "no account to be taken". Uncertainty and ambiguity flows through the clause.

As I have said previously, it is regrettable that there is so much uncertainty, as this is the first piece of tax legislation that overseas investors will come across. It leaves enormous powers of discretion to the Revenue,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
