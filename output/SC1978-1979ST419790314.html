	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the National Health Service (Preservation of Boards of Governors) Order 1979 (S.I., 1979, No. 51).</p></blockquote>
The Committee will recognise that the time for praying against this order has elapsed but the procedures of the House allow us, nevertheless, to discuss it, which is all the Opposition ever intended. There has been, I fear, misunderstanding in some quarters, as there always is when an Opposition table a prayer against a statutory instrument. I sought to allay that by combining the tabling of the prayer with the issue of a press notice to the entire medical press, explaining that we did not intend to vote on the order but merely to discuss it. However, that did not prevent anxieties from arising. I published a second press notice when it became known that the order was to be debated here this morning and I hope that all concerned will realise that we intend merely to debate the order, to explore the Government's intentions regarding the further time allowed by the order and to make one or two observations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order concerns 12 groups of specialist hospitals in London, among which are some of the most prestigious hospitals in the world. Merely to read the list of hospitals to be found in Appendix A of the Government's consultative paper on the London postgraduate hospitals is to realise that I do not exaggerate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hospitals under discussion include the Hospital for Sick Children at Great Ormond Street, at which the wife of the Prime Minister has the honour to be the chairman of the Governors; the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases at Queen Square; Moorfields Eye Hospital, perhaps one of the world's leading eye hospitals; the Bethlem Royal and Maudslev Hospitals, for psychiatry; the Royal Marsden Hospital, which has a pre-
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
eminent place in the treatment of cancer, and a number of others. Each of these hospitals is linked with a corresponding institute of postgraduate medical education and research, such as the Institute of Cancer Research and the Institute of Psychiatry which together represent a valuable resource not only for the patients but for medicine and the National Health Service as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These institutes are federated into the British Postgraduate Medical Federation which itself is one of the schools of London University. Here again, we have an organisation that straddles the difficult but productive boundary between the National Health Service and the universities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Government's consultative document about the London specialist postgraduate hospitals, published last September, the role of the hospitals and their related institutions was described in these words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The institutes and hospitals between them make an important contribution to postgraduate medical education in London, and to specialist and post-certificate training of nurses and paramedical staff. Although their contribution to medical education is a small part of the total in the country, it is nevertheless significant nationally and, indeed, internationally."</p></blockquote>
I stress, in particular, the international reputation of the institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"They carry out much important work in the fields of specialised medical and scientific research, and the development and trial of new treatments. This work too is of national and international importance. Clinically the hospitals serve as national referral centres, though on average between 85 per cent, and 90 per cent, of their patients are drawn from the Thames Regions. Many of them provide a substantial local service, sometimes by formal agreement with the AHAs concerned."</p></blockquote>
As one reads through the consultative document, and some of the predecessor documents that were produced by the Department, one gains the impression, perhaps wrongly, that there is an almost wistful regret that these institutions exist at all. An impression is given that they constitute an untidy, illogical and tiresome excrescence on the administrative scene and that their existence interferes with the neat, orderly, logical pattern of hospital care in London, tidily arranged in sectors, districts, areas and regions, each serving its adjacent population according
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0454">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
to some overall master plan in the DHSS, neatly wrapped and tied up—if I may be excused a bad pun—with "lengths of RAWP" which are devised in the Elephant and Castle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This view of the postgraduate hospitals emerges from the next sentence, from paragraph 1.7 of the report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Whether or not separate specialist hospitals of this kind would be established now, given complete freedom of choice, may be debatable."</p></blockquote>
One may ask, whose freedom of choice—the patient's or the administrator's? I suspect that what is there thought of is that of the civil servants in the DHSS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I approach the problem of this order and the issues that lie behind it from exactly the opposite end. I start by believing that the London postgraduate hospitals are part of the glorious heritage of British medicine—that they stand for some of the greatest advances in the history of British medicine, that they set standards of quality in treatment and research which bear comparison with those of similar institutions anywhere in the world. I believe that their destruction would be an incalculable loss to our system of medical education in Britain and so, ultimately, to the quality of care of patients throughout the National Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It matters far less to me that these hospitals do not fit neatly into the DHSS administrative system than that they should continue, under whatever system of governors, to provide not only the skilled specialised treatment for some of the most troublesome complaints to which mankind is prone, but also the means of further medical advance for the well-being of mankind as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Treatment, education and research are inseparable because, for medical education and medical research, clinical material—that is, patients in need of treatment—is essential. The link, therefore, between the hospitals and their institutes is a key issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's consultative document has described how these hospitals were left out of the 1974 reorganisation, and how the boards of governors continued to exist under an order made, I was interested to see, a few days before the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
General Election of February 1974. I cannot help feeling that the Ministers involved must have had other things on their minds at the time. Nevertheless, the order was made and the reorganisation of the hospitals was postponed for five years. The five years expired last month, and the order that we are now considering continues the postponement for a further three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assumption that underlay the 1973 Act, under which that order was made, was that five years would be long enough to decide how best to integrate the specialist postgraduate hospitals into the new organisation which was bringing together the hospital service, the community service and general practice into a single, integrated scheme. After prolonged, intensive consultation—nobody could complain that the Government have not consulted widely and over many years—it is fair to say that we are now no nearer a final solution than we were five years ago. There are three reasons for this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the reorganisation itself—this is not the time to go into it in detail—has proved very traumatic, and it is now widely recognised that further changes—I hope they will be evolutionary changes—are necessary in order to get the best from the resources provided for the National Health Service. The new structure is believed to be too elaborate and too bureaucratic, and it is felt that there are too many tiers of management. This is now recognised, to the extent that the Government of which I was a member bear some share of the blame. That must be readily acknowledged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Royal Commission set up to examine the finance and manpower of the NHS has received much information about structure and management, and its three-year report is expected during the summer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against this background it has been difficult to reach a clear view as to how the London postgraduate hospitals would fit in, because of the uncertainty of the future structure of the NHS itself. This is particularly true because they are in London. London has its own problems, which are the subject of a separate study by the London Health Planning Consortium. So, the background against which this consultation has been made is itself uncertain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0455">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Secondly, the reorganisation of the NHS structure involved changes in the system of management, and moved to the system of consensus management—team management. Here again, it would be difficult to find large numbers of people in the NHS who are so convinced of the merits of this new system of team management that they would be willing to adopt it holus-bolus. Only one of the 12 hospitals —Queen Charlotte's Hospital in West London, a very small hospital—has moved towards the system of consensus management which was built into the reorganised Health Service. Therefore, the boards of governors have felt reluctant to embark down a road which would inevitably lead them into a system of management whose merits are far from proven yet in the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third reason stems from the nature of the hospitals. They are heterogeneous in size and nature. They are geographically widely separate. Many have branches which exceed substantially in size she original central London hospital, the branches being located well out into the suburbs and beyond. They serve populations from all over the country. One must remember that the four Thames regions stretch from the boundaries of Hampshire to the east coast of Kent, from Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire down to the English Channel. Even if one says that 85 per cent, of the patients come from the Thames region, that still represents a substantial slice of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against this background it is extremely difficult to see how these hospitals could sensibly be integrated within the NHS system as it applies in London. Yet the Government have decided that they must be integrated eventually. But, like Peter Abelard confronted with the prayer to forswear sin, the Government add the words, "But not yet."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> 
	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe it was Peter Abelard. The words are often attributed to St. Augustine. You, Mr. English, know more about these matters than I do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we now have the "not yet" order, the order to postpone the abolition
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
of the boards of governors at least until 1982, unless this order is repealed in the meantime. If that were all, it would be right to ask the Government what they intend to do with the time which the order provides. That is a legitimate question. But it is not all, because the Government have given a clear indication of what they wish to do with the time provided by *he order. They envisage a two-stage process, the first an interim stage. They hope that by the end of 1979 they will be able to create a special health authority, to be called the London Postgraduate Hospitals Authority, to act as a holding company—that 'is the nearest analogy I can find—for the 12 groups of hospitals with which we are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The functions of the London Postgraduate Hospitals Authority are well set out in paragraphs 3.29 to 3.32 of the consultative document. The main point is that the hospitals would be brought together for planning and resource allocation, and that there would be an intermediate tier between the hospitals and the Department which has hitherto administered them direct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final stage would be some form of complete absorption of the hospitals into the NHS structure by a method as yet undecided; that would be the stage at which the boards of governors themselves would disappear. It is made clear in the Secretary of State's foreword to the consultative document that the interim stage would not involve the abolition of the boards of governors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that you would draw me up pretty sharply, Mr. English, if on this order I went into the longer-term possibilities. That clearly must be left for another occasion. But as this order specifically provides for the retention of the boards of governors for the continuing interim period, I think we are entitled, in debating this order, to do two things—first, to ask the Minister how he intends to deal with the issues which arise in the time provided by the order. The interim LPHA solution sits very uneasily alongside the existing structure of the NHS in London. Why does he believe that this interim position will be any better than the one that exists at present? Why is there any necessity to do anything in the meantime? What will be the game? All change results
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0456">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
in frictional costs and in upheaval. Why is he satisfied that the benefits will outweigh the disadvantages?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument is not fully set out in this document. The Government assume that the proposed change will be better than the present position. In his preface the Secretary of State writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… I feel progress must be made towards overcoming the most important weaknesses"—</p></blockquote>
which are not defined—
	<br><blockquote><p>"of the present arrangements, particularly in the field of planning and resource allocation."</p></blockquote>
There seem to be three reasons why one should question that judgment. First, this is, without doubt, an extra tier of management, coming at a time when there is a good deal of disillusion about tiers of management in the NHS. It will involve extra costs when the finance for the Health Service is already under severe strain and it could well give rise to delays in decision-making, when decision-making in the NHS is under strong criticism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, regarding resource allocation, these hospitals will not fit into the RAWP process unless somehow the 85 per cent, of patients which come from the four Thames regions provide some kind of excuse whereby a substantial part of their resources will flow via the Thames regions. As I understand it, that is not envisaged at all. The RAWP process, based upon the formulae apparently under review by the DHSS, is based upon populations, morbidity, mortality, and a whole range of other factors. It is exceedingly difficult to see how the RAWP process—presumably this is what the Secretary of State had in mind when he talked about allocation of resources—can have any relevance as it is applied to the rest of the Health Service in being applied to these 12 hospital groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hospitals are at present funded outside RAWP and that is not unique. The four special hospitals—the Broadmoors and Ramptons and so on—are funded outside RAWP. There is the example of the Common Services Agency in Scotland which is funded outside RAWP and provides common services for the Health Service in Scotland. There seems to be no inherent objection to funding outside RAWP something which does not fit neatly into the RAWP system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
However, as I understand it, the London Postgraduate Hospitals Authority will itself be funded outside the strict RAWP formula. One asks, therefore, where is the advantage of putting this separate layer between the Department and the hospital? How will that help the planning and allocation of resources?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third reason to question this arrangement is that I foresee difficult relations between the LPHA—the new, intermediate tier—and the continuing boards of governors. If the boards of governors have a strong representation on the authority, so that in a sense they come to dominate it, there is a grave danger that the "big boys"—the Bethlems and the Great Ormond Streets—will gang up to do down the "small boys"—the skin hospital, the Eastman Dental hospital, and the other small ones. That certainly is a fear that I have seen expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative is that the new authority has a strong chairman and a strong team of officers, and that the boards of governors do not have a dominating influence. There is a risk there that it will undermine one of the real advantages of the system of boards of governors—that a high degree of independence and autonomy can lead to effective local administration, swift decision taking, good local leadership, and happy relations within the hospitals that are served.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Which is it to be? If there is to be the intermediate system, how will it overcome either one of the disadvantages?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dan Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the right hon Gentleman is suggesting that the governors should have an overpowering influence. Would he be a little more explicit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not. As will be seen, if I remain within order—as I hope I shall—I shall indicate my view that this interim solution has not a great deal to commend it. I believe that, given all the uncertainties, particularly the uncertainty of the Royal Commission, it will be wiser not to proceed with the intermediate solution but to use the time given by the order to await the report of the Royal Commission, and then see what pattern emerges and how the postgraduate hospitals fit into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0457">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
I believe that the Government are on the horns of a dilemma if they set up the interim solution: which will be top dog—the boards of governors, in a loose co-ordinating committee, or a new, strong body that will dominate the boards of governors and undermine much of the advantage of that system of running hospitals? That system, whatever one may say, has worked extremely well over the years, and is looked to with some envy, particularly by the undergraduate teaching hospitals which lost their boards of governors in 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not, therefore, immediately self-evident that the proposed interim change will bring any benefit except, possibly, in terms—with which I do not have much sympathy—of neat, tidy paper organo-grams.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Minister a second question about cost. Paragraph 3.37 of the consultative document, which is one of the key paragraphs, is very short:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Initially the Authority would need to be staffed by a small cadre of officers which would include administrative, medical, nursing and financial expertise, headed by a multi-disciplinary team. The precise staffing would be for discussion, it is hoped that initial costs would be kept within a total of £200,000 a year, excluding accommodation."</p></blockquote>
For £200,000 excluding accommodation there will be a modest staff—about 25 to 35 people, depending on the ratio of senior staff to junior staff. The accommodation, if it is in central London, will cost at least as much again and possibly more, so that we are approaching half a million ponds a year. For what? How can one justify abstracting half a million pounds a year of extra cost for administration at a time when half a million pounds would be of enormous value, not least to my constituency, where we are threatened with losing hospitals and having nothing put in their place at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How does the Minister justify the cost? What is meant by "initially"? That may be the cost for the first month. Does he envisage this growing substantially over the period? If so, to how much? Or is he prepared to give the Committee and the House a firm guarantee that this really is the limit, that, allowing for inflation of course, an establishment which
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
in 1978 money when this was written would have been paid for by £200,000 will be the limit? I think that that would go a long way to reassure those who are apprehensive about this new authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You, Mr. English, will know better than most of us that bureaucracy tends to be self-perpetuating and procreative. I fear deeply that with the creation of a new bureaucracy, however small it may be initially, we shall find ourselves saddled with something which will be permanent and increasing.

Thirdly, how do the Government see the relationship of other postgraduate institutions in London to the new London Postgraduate Hospitals Authority? Here I refer in particular to the Royal Postgraduate Medical School at Hammersmith, which is a most important institution in the Health Service and performs immensely valuable postgraduate education functions, not only for doctors in this country but also for many doctors coming from overseas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may quote briefly from the comments made by the Hammersmith Royal Postgraduate Medical School on the consultative document:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the Hammersmith complex is a major component of the national resource devoted to postgraduate medical education and research and complements the activities of the BPMF Institutes and the specialist postgraduate hospitals. Hammersmith hospital is at present administered, (through the North Hammersmith District Management Team) by the Ealing, Hammersmith and Hounslow Area Health Authority (Teaching) and the question arises as to whether or not that Authority can successfully deal with the various problems identified in the Consultative Document, and this paper, which are inherent in the management of a postgraduate teaching hospital having national and international, as well as local, responsibilities."</p></blockquote>
I do not know why Hammersmith hospital and the Royal Postgraduate Medical School was swept into the reorganisation rather than treated with the 12 groups of hospitals with which this order is concerned. Nevertheless, it was, and I know that this has given rise to considerable difficulties. It is a very sore thumb sticking out in a hard-pressed, even if sometimes somewhat politically dominated, area health authority in West London. Clearly, the relationship of that school with the institutes and with the hospitals
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0458">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
with which we are concerned is a point of some interest. It would be helpful if the Government could give some indication of how they envisage that working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have asked the Government a number of questions. As I suspect that the House will accept the order and that we shall therefore have the extra breathing space provided by it, it is right that I should give some indication of how my party sees the future of this important sector of the National Health Service and of medical education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until the Royal Commission has reported, it seems to us unnecessary and on balance undesirable to make any change at all. When the Royal Commission has reported, then it will be time enough to decide whether any changes are necessary for the London postgraduate hospitals, whether in the long or the short term, and if so, what changes are best in the light of the overall thrust of the Merrison report and of the reactions to it inside and outside the NHS. Certainly, it is no part of our policy to want to rush into change for change's sake. Where, as here, an important part of the NHS seems to be working reasonably satisfactorily, there are merits in leaving well alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Among the many interests who, over the last three years, have beaten a path to my door to tell me what is wrong with the NHS, not one has said that the existing arrangements covering the London postgraduate hospitals is so unsatisfactory that it should be changed. I have had no representations from governing bodies. T have had no representations from the medical profession, the nursing profession or the administrative profession. Nobody from the four Thames RHAs. from the Greater London AHAs, or from the undergraduate teaching hospitals has made any representation to me. This situation is so unsatisfactory that it must be changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that London University is anxious to see the hospitals brought under some sort of umbrella organisation, to parallel that of the British Postgraduate Medical Federation as the umbrella organisation for the institutes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has existed for a long time. It may work extremely well within the context of London University, and I would not for one moment wish to question that. Within the context of medical education, a valuable way of administering the Univertiy may be to have the federation as a single school within London University. But it does not follow that there should be a corresponding extra tier within the Health Service to administer the hospitals. London University is not responsible for running the hospitals, or for the care of patients. The view of the University deserves respect, but it cannot be a decisive view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event the future of medical education in London is, itself, now under intensive study. The Flowers committee has been set up to examine the deployment of resources in the area of medical education in London University, covering principally the 12 medical undergraduate schools, Against this background it would be difficult to argue firmly for any one form of reorganisation for the hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It follows, therefore, that no one should assume that, because the present Government believe that the costs, both financial and frictional. are outweighed by the benefits of the proposed interim change and the method of running these hospitals, a successor Conservative Government will necessarily take the same view. We shall want to look at the question afresh in the light of post-Merrison policy. In the meantime we certainly agree that this order is necessary to hold the position in the interim, and to give more time for final arrangements to be worked out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Health and Social Security (Mr. Roland Moyle)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful if I intervene at this Juncture, since the right hon Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Jenkin) said that one of the advantages of a debate on this order now, in spite of the fact that the time for praying had passed, would be to probe the Government's intentions with regard to the future of these hospitals and to see how we shall use the time which has been given to us by the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0459">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
Much of the background to these postgraduate hospitals and their related institutes has been set out by the right hon Gentleman in his opening remarks. To summarise, there are 12 postgraduate hospitals in London, each having an associated postgraduate institute which is linked through the British Postgraduate Medical Federation as part of a London University school. The work they do, besides healing, involves advanced research into medicine and postgraduate education. At the same time—this is particularly important from the point of view of the patients—they have a service role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the years many solutions, principally inspired by a desire to combine the postgraduate hospitals' advanced role with the service requirements of the National Health Service, have been pro-posed for their management, but none has been adopted. The attempt was last made in the run-up to the 1974 reorganisation, but by the time it was proposed to put that reorganisation on the statute book no solution to that problem had been worked out by the right hon Member for Wanstead and Woodford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As each hospital is directly managed by a board of governors, the last Conservative Government merely extended the life of the boards of governors for five years in order to give time for a solution integrating the postgraduate hospitals into the National Health Service to emerge That five years concluded on 21 February this year. It is therefore necessary to extend the life of the boards of governors. No solution has yet emerged to the problem but there is progress, as I shall relate, and it is a little pessimistic to say that we are no nearer a solution now than we were in 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the meantime, the hospitals have continued much as they have always done. That is to say, the boards of governors are accountable to the Secretary of State who appoints them. They are financed directly by the Secretary of State and that places management functions on the Department of Health and Social Security. These functions have been discharged with some skill, but they impose a strain on the Department as DHSS staff are not trained or organised for a management role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
The hospitals are outside the resource allocation system of the National Health Service and at a time of tight allocations, this may mean the misapplication of scarce funds. Although the hospitals consult the various health authorities in London, both region and area, they are not part of the National Health Service planning system. Again, the danger of misapplication of scarce resources arises. The hospitals have no close links with local authorities or community health councils. I think that close links with local authorities are important in the present working relationships between the Health Service and local authority social service departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The management of the hospitals, particularly some of the smaller hospitals, remains small-scale and unadapted to modern conditions. Clearly, our predecessors were right to recognise a need for change and we agree with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon Members may ask—as the right hon Gentleman has already asked—why the Government have taken five years to consider the problem, only to sec a further extension of the life of the board of governors. It appears that we agree about the effects of the reorganisation of the National Health Service in 1974. That was what I understood the right hon Gentleman to have said. I think he will not be surprised when I say that, for the first two-and-a-half years following that reorganisation, the Department and Ministers were inevitably involved in trying to sort out the immediate consequences of that reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was therefore not until 1977 that we were able to turn our attention to the complex issue of the future management of the postgraduate hospitals. Since then, we have completed an extremely careful analysis and consideration of the issues involved in the management of these hospitals. The right hon Gentleman has already paid tribute to the amount of consultation and discussion that we have undertaken with the interests concerned, in particular the representatives of the 12 boards of governors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1977 and 1978 we held two major conferences with representatives of all the health and academic interests where together we discussed ways and means of ensuring adequate arrangements in the future management of these hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0460">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
The 1977 conference concluded that there was a need for change in the arrangements for the hospitals. Arising from discussion at the 1978 conference there has emerged a broad measure of agreement which was reflected in the consultative document—to which the right hon Gentleman extensively referred—entitled "The Future Management of the London Specialist Postgraduate Hospitals", which was published last September. In between the two conferences my right hon Friend and I have visited the great majority of the postgraduate hospitals and discussed the problems with staff and boards of governors concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The central issue in these discussions is a complex one: how to preserve the special service and educational role of these hospitals—our admiration for their roles in this respect is shared by the right hon Gentleman: I would not depart by one iota from the words he used to praise them—and to preserve those special service and educational roles while, at the some time, bringing them under the structure of the National Health Service which. at the moment, is organised on a geographical basis through health authorities with considerably devolved powers. But at this juncture we still need time to effect the changes. That was one reason for bringing the order forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principal reason for preserving the boards of governors was that unless the order were confirmed the boards of governors would automatically disappear and management would automatically transfer to the area health authorities, within whose boundaries are the specialist postgraduate hospitals. That would have meant reallocation of the units, which I am sure nobody would have wanted. While the disappearance of the postgraduate hospitals within the boundaries of some AHAs might not have been too damaging for some boards of governors, there was general agreement among all those consulted that the complete integration of all postgraduate hospitals within the NHS on an arbitrary geographic basis would be inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That sets out the background to the laying of this order in a way that will enable the Committee to understand the issues. I have also put before the Committee the arguments which support the
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
passage of the order. However, I have spoken of discussions, formal and informal, of conferences and discussion documents, of proposals and responses. The right hon Gentleman for Wanstead & Woodford and members of the Committee will have rightly concluded that there is much more to this than I have so far outlined. Therefore, although it does not directly bear on the passage of this order but on how we shall use the time allowed under the order, I feel the Committee would be helped and, in a sense, is entitled to know how the minds of my right hon Friend and myself are moving in coming to a conclusion about the future of these hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The starting point for consideration of this issue is the case for changing existing arrangements. The consultative document sets out the case for change. It points to the urgent need to plan for the patient services provided by the postgraduate hospitals within the context of London as a whole. The document also makes it clear that the present management arrangements in some of the boards of governors—particularly the smaller ones—are less than satisfactory and therefore need strengthening. At the same time staff working in the hospitals have been left in limbo since 1974, which has adversely affected their morale in these hospitals during the last five years. I think it fair to say that broadly the comments we have received on the document accept that there is a case for change. The question to be answered is, what form should change take, and how best can it be accomplished without damaging either the hospitals or their staff?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three main options were examined, but in each case they presented particular difficulties. The options were, first, to place the management of the postgraduate hospitals under the area health authority to which they most naturally relate; secondly, to establish special health authorities accountable to regional health authorities; thirdly, to establish a single special health authority directly accountable to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We came to the conclusion that it was not possible at this juncture to decide which of these alternatives would be appropriate to particular hospitals because, in the first place—this is important—we cannot accept that there is an argument
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0461">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
for saying that all the hospitals should be treated, ultimately, in the same way. We recognised that there was a strong case for beginning with a single postgraduate hospitals authority containing all 12 hospitals, for granting it delegated powers, for remitting to it specific tasks and for such an authority to be an agent for change. I think that that is the most important aspect of the whole exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We envisage that the major task of such an authority would be to develop proposals for the management in the longer term of each of the postgraduate hospitals and, as necessary for its future, we hope within a year or so of its establishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, I expect that the authority will introduce at an early stage improved procedures for planning the services provided by those hospitals and for determining their resource allocations. In connection with that, it is true, as the right hon Gentlemen said, that the special health authority, if it were set up, and the hospitals would not readily lend themselves to allocation of funds within the Resource Allocation Working Party formula.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, an alternative system of resource allocation to those hospitals will have to be worked. It will be one of the functions of the special health authority, the London Postgraduate Hospitals Authority, to work out a suitable system. We hope that it will be as objective as possible in the allocation of funds to the hospitals, although I strongly suspect that there will always be a fairly subjective element in the allocation of resources to those famous, distinguished and unique institutions. I agree that the RAWP formula is not really appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the LPHA could act on behalf of the Secretary of State in daytoday matters within prescribed limits. The response to the consultative document has been generally in favour of the London Postgraduate Hospitals Authority being set up. It received widespread support from—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I spoke at length to begin with, and do not want to take up too much of the Committee's time. Would it be fair to say that, when the Minister states that the response has been
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
favourable, a considerable volume of that response is, "If there must be some interim change, perhaps this is the least unsatisfactory of those that have been suggested," rather than many institutions positively arguing for that interim change?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I think that the right hon Gentleman has not quite got it right. The response is that there is a need for a change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That this is the preferred form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that there is a need for change; that was the decision of the 1977 conference. With that need for change, the best way forward is through the London Postgraduate Hospitals Authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not deny that there are pros and cons to all the ways forward that are set out in the discussion document. However, the best response we received was for the creation of the LPHA. For example, it received widespread support from most of the boards of governors. I believe that there were only two boards which felt that that was not the best way forward. The University of London believes that it is the best way forward. The right hon Gentleman might be particularly interested to know that, although the Greater London Council has not beaten a path to his door, it has come to us to say that it is the best way forward. So has the London Boroughs Association.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But does not the right hon Gentleman recognise that of course the local authorities will welcome anything of this sort? They still harbour long-term ambitions to take over the Health Service. I do not know whether that is the Government's ambition; it is certainly not the Opposition's. I treat the opinions of such bodies with respect, because they are important. However, I do not feel that in this context they should have a dominant influence on the decisions that are taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I am sure that the right hon Gentleman will devote a considerable part of his time to educating his fellow Conservatives about the way forward in these matters. I hope that he has more success in the future than he has had in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trade union and professional interests also favour this way forward. In fact, if
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0462">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
there has been dissent on a major scale from the concept of the London Postgraduate Hospitals Authority, it comes from regional and area health authorities. They have suggested that the smaller hospitals might now be transferred to direct management by the area health authority: a question which will be a subject for early consideration by the London Postgraduate Hospitals Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not regard this as a sensible course, at least in the short-term, but some of those whom we have consulted regard management by the area health authorities as the only possible long-term solution for the smaller postgraduate hospitals, and they are concerned that if these are placed under a single postgraduate hospitals authority it might subsequently prove difficult to disengage them and link them with the area health authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that the converse of that argument is one of the reasons why a number of postgraduate hospitals have decided to settle for the London Postgraduate Hospitals Authority. The right hon Gentleman may like to bear that in mind in setting out the views of his own party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Weight has been added to what I might term the area health authority view by the uncertainty surrounding the future of some of the institutes with which these hospitals are associated. Honourable Members will be aware of the close and interdependent relationship which exists between the postgraduate medical institutes and the specialist hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In July 1976 the University of London appointed a working party under the chairmanship of Professor Norman Morris to re-examine the objectives of postgraduate medical education and institutes and the policies required to achieve them. The report was published in 1977 and a summary of its conclusions is included in appendix B of our consultative document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The University of London and the University Grants Committee have considered the Morris report, but they have decided that decisions on the future of the postgraduate institutes must now await the finding of a working party set up by the University under Lord Flowers to consider the future of medical and dental education in London. This working party aims to complete its report by March 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
In the light of the Morris report and the Flowers committee and, indeed, the fact that the Royal Commission is due to report this year, we have considered whether it would be right to go ahead now with the establishment of the special health authority. We have not yet taken a final decision on this, but I should make it clear that we remain convinced that the early establishment of such an authority is the right way to make progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be argued that we should set up an authority of six of the larger postgraduate hospitals. We could say that whatever the outcome of the Royal Commission such an authority is likely to be the only feasible arrangement for the management of these hospitals. Such an authority would be able to concentrate wholly upon bringing about the necessary improvements in planning and resource allocation arrangements, which are the main reasons for change. But we feel still that we are right to pursue the original consultative document proposal, for three main reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, it would be wrong to pre-empt the work of the Flowers committee and take a decision ahead of its recommendations. Secondly, we consider that the proposed authority has an important role to play as an agent of change. Thirdly, if we are to be realistic about the Royal Commission—although it may actually report this year, probably within the next few months—time will be needed to study both its report and the Flowers report. If we do not take action now an opportunity will have been missed to improve the planning and resource allocation and management arrangements, particularly for the smaller hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon Gentleman has asked how the system will improve on the present system. There will be representatives from the special health authority on the London Health Planning Consortium. There will be representatives on the special health authority from the various health authorities in London, and of course the existence of a special health authority will lend strength to the management particularly of those smaller postgraduate hospitals whose management needs strengthening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all those ways, therefore, there will be a much closer integration between the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0463">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
patient services provided by the London postgraduate hospitals, especially on a day-to-day basis, than now exists, and that will enable planning to go forward more smoothly and in cohesion and team work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, I cannot say that no more than £200,000 will ever be spent on the management of the special health authority. Certainly we are seized of the need to restrain management costs to the minimum. The rather disastrous and proliferating administration and management of the Health Service that we inherited in 1974 has been cut back in the last two years by the management costs exercise. Our attitude to the management of the special health authority will be guided by those continuing principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that the London Postgraduate Hospitals Authority is not intended to be a second tier of management. The postgraduate hospitals will be managed as a single tier. I envisage that the boards of governors will eventually disappear as separate authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a different issue from saying that the postgraduate hospitals have represented to us—and we have some sympathy with it—that there is great advantage in their connections with the community in having a group of what might be termed "lay friends" associated with them. We shall certainly do our best to encourage such a development for the future. We might have committees associated with the hospitals that have boards of governors, probably composed largely of people similar to those who comprise the boards of governors now. However, the boards of governors, as management organisations, will give way, we hope, within the three years, to the special health authority and its direct management. There will not, therefore, be an extra tier of management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not intended to disturb the arrangements that we have made for Hammersmith, St. Mark's and similar hospitals, which will continue as part of their various health authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dan Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could we have something more succinct? I think that we are entitled to that. Anyone who has been interested in the development of hospitals since the Health Service was set up by
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
Nye Bevan will be dismayed by the knowledge that the administration side has increased tremendously. My wife was a nurse for many years, and in visiting the hospital I was always impressed by the number of people walking round the grounds with pieces of paper in their hands. What precisely would those gentlemen be doing for the service of healing? If hospitals are not for healing, what the blazes are they for? That is a commonplace observation, but one that, I fear, is tremendously overlooked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister, not only with respect but with affection, to tell us that the healing facilities under the new proposal will be enhanced, that the cost will not be increased, and that, as a consequence, the efficiency of our hospitals will become in the eyes of the public the focus for a new source of healing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to the Minister to prepare a paper, as brief as possible, on those three easily-recognisable lines, so that when we meet again it will be the substance of our discussion. Those functions must be provenly adhered to, or there could easily be what we have seen over the past 25 or 30 years—a further astounding increase in administration. I cannot be convinced that administration is a healing factor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Committee is not due to sit again. What will happen is that an order setting out the constitution of the new special health authority will be laid before the House before very long. Certainly, I shall give earnest regard to my hon Friend's suggestion about a background paper. However, we are dealing with the future, and the future is speculative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the functions of the postgraduate hospitals is to promote the frontiers of medical knowledge. These tend to be sophisticated and expensive. Therefore, I cannot guarantee that the cost of running the London postgraduate hospitals will decrease either absolutely or as a proportion of the running costs of the Health Service nationally or in London. I rather suspect that, with the best will in the world, the contrary might well be true. I shall give consideration to my hon Friend's suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0464">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
However, on the subject of administration, I point out, first, that under reorganisation the Health Service took responsibility for the community health functions of local authorities, and that led to a substantial increase in administration. Secondly, the Health Service also set up works departments to look after the fabric of the service and its estate. That led to an increase.!t also set up a comprehensive personnel section for the first time. I do not think that anybody could deny the need for that in the current circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, despite all that, we thought that there was an uncovenanted increase in administration. Therefore, from April 1976 we imposed a ceiling on the recruitment and the creation of any more management posts. From April 1977 onwards, we deliberately set out to cut management costs in the Health Service roughly to 5.6 per cent, of the total costs. We were aiming to achieve success in that regard by 1 April 1979, but most of our health authorities have achieved it ahead of the target date. The exercise is well up to schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that in the short term, as far as I am able and in the considerable bounds of your indulgence, Mr. English, I have satisfied the points raised by my hon Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dan Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not entirely. I am looking all the time for the word "healing" to be expressed more prominently by the Minister when he is talking about the frontiers of medicine, as it were. Surely that is the only purpose of a hospital. It has no other purpose. I should be happier if I could understand that these frontiers of medical science are clearly associated with research into certain harmful diseases and that they will unravel the secret of healing. I continually use that word "healing", because if hospitals are not for healing, what are they for? Responsible people must use the word "healing" much more frequently than they do, and healing must be related to the cost. The question must be asked what on earth the influx of administration would do in terms of healing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is to be no further meeting of the Committee—that is a pity, because the
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
subject is tremendously worth while pursuing—may we have the paper? I must assume that if we are not to have further meetings of the Committee we are going back to the Floor of the House. Where do we further these discussions? Where can we get the kind of satisfaction wanted by those of us who are genuinely interested in the main function of hospitals, namely, to heal the sick and the disabled, and where can we find the avenue by which we can pursue this matter further?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Moyle</div> <!-- member -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw my hon Friend's attention to my opening remarks in response to the right hon Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Jenkin), when I put healing as the first role of hospitals. But although it is their prime role, it is not their only role, because they have a responsibility along with healing for advanced research into medicine and postgraduate education. That is where the healing role is enhanced. As I have said, hospitals have a service role, and that is the role that might be improved. The object of this exercise is to integrate the medical service they give to patients more closely with the medical service that the area and regional health authorities give in the National Health Service generally.
