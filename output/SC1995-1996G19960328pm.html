	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gyles Brandreth 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of Chester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I must also wish you a good afternoon—it is good to see you again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the convenience of the Committee, would you consider doing something? I know that you usually do it, but the Clerks customarily do not. We are coming to a series of decisions about new clauses 41 and 42, and amendments (a), (d), (b), (e), (c) and (f). The Clerk normally reads out the relevant wording but does not say whether we are considering amendments (a), (b), (c) or (d). Do you take my meaning? Normally, you would identify the amendment by the appropriate letter. Given the complexity of the matter, I feel that it would help the Committee if you would do so—but I may of course be wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can help the hon. Gentleman. When the Clerk reads out the title of the new clause, he does so formally. The amendments will be taken against the new clause; then—I hope that the Clerk will correct me if I am wrong—we come to questions relating either to the amendments or to the new clause; finally, we decide whether the new clause should be added to the Bill. Am I being sufficiently obscure for consternation to reign? Would the hon. Gentleman like me to go over that again more slowly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandreth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be such a reflection on me, Mr. McWilliam, if I did ask you to go through that matter again more slowly that I shall not ask you to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett (Denton and Reddish)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. McWilliam. You would help the Government Whip much more if you shouted Aye or Noe for him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have served my time in the Whips Office and I have no intention of going back to those days—either formally or informally. I shall make it clear which amendment we are dealing with at any given time if those amendments are moved formally. As I understand it, those amendments have all been debated. If that helps the Committee, I shall deal with the amendments in that way. Does that suggestion meet with general opprobrium—or worse?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>RESTRICTION ON TERMINATION OF TENANCY FOR FAILURE TO PAY SERVICE CHARGE</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<ol>

	<li>".—A landlord may not, in relation to premises let as a dwelling, exercise a right of re-entry or forfeiture for failure to pay a service charge unless the amount of the service charge—</li>
	<span class='label label-info column'>916</span>

	<ol>

	<li>is agreed or admitted by the tenant, or</li>

	<li>has been the subject of determination by a court or by an arbitral tribunal in proceedings pursuant to an arbitration agreement (within the meaning of Part I of the Arbitration Act 1996).</li></ol>

	<li>Where the amount is the subject of determination, the landlord may not exercise any such right of re-entry or forfeiture until after the end of the period of 14 days beginning with the day after that on which the decision of the court or arbitral tribunal is given.</li>

	<li>For the purposes of this section the amount of a service charge shall be taken to be determined when the decision of the court or arbitral tribunal is given, notwithstanding the possibility of an appeal or other legal challenge to the decision.</li>

	<li>In this section "service charge" means a service charge within the meaning of section 18(1) of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, other than one excluded from that section by section 27 of that Act (rent of dwelling registered and not entered as variable).</li>

	<li>Nothing in this section affects the power of a landlord to serve notice under section 146(1) of the Law of Property Act 1925 (notice of breach of covenant or condition).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But any such notice in respect of premises let as a dwelling and failure to pay a service charge shall state that this section applies and set out the effect of subsection (1) above; and it is not effective for the purposes of that section unless it does.</li>

	<li>Nothing in this section affects the exercise of a right of re-entry or forfeiture on other grounds.".—[

	<section>

	<div class='title'>DETERMINATION OF REASONABLENESS OF SERVICE CHARGES</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>".—(1) In section 19 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (limitation of service charges: reasonableness), after subsection (2) insert—

	<div class='ul'>

	<li>(2A) A tenant by whom, or a landlord to whom, a service charge is alleged to be payable may apply to a leasehold valuation tribunal for a determination—</li>

	<ol>

	<li>whether costs incurred for services, repairs, maintenance, insurance or management were reasonably incurred,</li>

	<li>whether services or works for which costs were incurred are of a reasonable standard, or</li>

	<li>whether an amount payable before costs are incurred is reasonable.</li></ol>

	<li>(2B) An application may also be made to a leasehold valuation tribunal by a tenant by whom, or landlord to whom, a service charge may be payable for a determination—</li>

	<ol>

	<li>whether if costs were incurred for services, repairs, maintenance, insurance or management of any specified description they would be reasonable,</li>

	<li>whether services provided or works carried out to a particular specification would be of a reasonable standard, or</li>

	<li>what amount payable before costs are incurred would be reasonable.</li></ol>

	<li>(2C) No application under subsection (2A) or (2B) may be made in respect of a matter which—</li>

	<ol>

	<li>has been agreed or admitted by the tenant,</li>

	<li>under an arbitration agreement to which the tenant is a party is to be referred to arbitration, or</li>

	<li>has been the subject of determination by a court or arbitral tribunal.'.</li></ol></div> <!-- ul --></p></blockquote></p>

	<p>(2) In the Schedule to the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, for paragraph 8 (right to challenge landlord's choice of insurers) substitute—</p>

	<p>
	<ol>

	<li>'8.—This paragraph applies where a tenancy of a dwelling requires the tenant to insure the dwelling with an insurer nominated by the landlord.</li>

	<li>The tenant or landlord may apply to a county court or leasehold valuation tribunal for a determination whether—</li>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0520">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>917</span>

	<ol>

	<li>the insurance which is available from the nominated insurer for insuring the tenant's dwelling is unsatisfactory in any respect, or</li>

	<li>the premiums payable in respect of any such insurance are excessive.</li></ol>

	<li>(3) No such application may be made in respect of a matter which—</li>

	<ol>

	<li>has been agreed or admitted by the tenant,</li>

	<li>under an arbitration agreement to which the tenant is a party is to be referred to arbitration, or</li>

	<li>has been the subject of determination by a court or arbitral tribunal.</li></ol>

	<li>(4) On an application under this paragraph the court or tribunal may make—</li>

	<ol>

	<li>an order requiring the landlord to nominate such other insurer as is specified in the order, or</li>

	<li>an order requiring him to nominate another insurer who satisfies such requirements in relation to the insurance of the dwelling as are specified in the order.</li></ol>

	<li>(5) Any such order of a leasehold valuation tribunal may, with the leave of the court, be enforced in the same way as an order of a county court to the same effect.</li>

	<li>(6) An agreement by the tenant of a dwelling (other than an arbitration agreement) is void in so far as it purports to provide for a determination in a particular manner, or on particular evidence, of any question which may be the subject of an application under this paragraph.'.</li></ol></p>

	<p>(3) In the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 before section 32 under the heading 
	<i>"Supplementary provisions"</i> insert—</p>

	<p>
	<i>"Jurisdiction of leasehold valuation tribunal.</i></p>

	<p>
	<ol>

	<li>31A.—The jurisdiction conferred by this Act on a leasehold valuation tribunal is exercisable by a rent assessment committee constituted in accordance with Schedule 10 to the Rent Act 1977 which when so constituted for the purposes of exercising any such jurisdiction shall be known as a leasehold valuation tribunal.</li>

	<li>Where in any proceedings before a court there falls for determination any question falling within the jurisdiction of a leasehold valuation tribunal under this Act, the court may by order transfer to such a tribunal so much of the proceedings as relate to the determination of that question.</li>

	<li>Without prejudice to the generality of any other statutory provision—

	<ol>

	<li>the power to make regulations under section 74(1)(b) of the Rent Act 1977 (procedure of rent assessment committees) extends to prescribing the procedure to be followed in connection with any proceedings before a leasehold valuation tribunal under this Act; and</li>

	<li>rules of court may prescribe the procedure to be followed in connection with any such transfer as is mentioned in subsection (2) above.</li></ol></li>

	<li>No costs incurred by a party in connection with proceedings under this Act before a leasehold valuation tribunal shall be recoverable by order of any court (whether in consequence of a transfer under subsection (2) or otherwise).</li>

	<li>Paragraphs 2, 3 and 7 of Schedule 22 to the Housing Act 1980 (supplementary provisions relating to leasehold valuation tribunals: appeals and provision of information) apply to a leasehold valuation tribunal constituted for the purposes of this section.</li></ol></p>

	<p>
	<i>Leasehold valuation tribunal: applications and fees.</i></p>

	<p>
	<ol>

	<li>31B.—The Secretary of State may make provision by order as to the form of, or the particulars to be contained in, an application made to a leasehold valuation tribunal under this Act.</li>

	<li>The Secretary of State may make provision by order—</li>

	<ol>

	<li>requiring the payment of fees in respect of any such application, or in respect of any proceedings before, a leasehold valuation tribunal under this Act; and</li>
	<span class='label label-info column'>918</span>

	<li>empowering a leasehold valuation tribunal to require a party to proceedings before it to reimburse any other party the amount of any fees paid by him.</li></ol>

	<li>The fees payable shall be such as may be specified in or determined in accordance with the order; and the order shall be framed with a view to securing that taking one year with another the amount of the fees charged is sufficient to meet the reasonable cost of providing the service to which they relate.</li>

	<li>An order about fees may make different provision for different cases or classes of case or for different areas.</li>

	<li>An order may in particular—</li>

	<ol>

	<li>make different provision in relation to proceedings transferred to the tribunal from that applicable where an application was made to the tribunal, and</li>

	<li>provide for the reduction or waiver of fees by reference to the financial resources of the party by whom they are to be paid or met.</li></ol>

	<li>In the latter case the order may apply, subject to such modifications as may be specified in the order, any other statutory means-testing regime as it has effect from time to time.</li>

	<li>An order under this section shall be made by statutory instrument which shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.".</li></ol></p>

	<p>(5) For section 20C of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (limitation of service charges: costs of court proceedings) substitute—</p>

	<p>
	<i>"Limitation of service charges: costs of proceedings.</i></p>

	<p>
	<ol>

	<li>20C.—A tenant may make an application for an order that all or any of the costs incurred, or to be incurred, by the landlord in connection with proceedings before a court or leasehold valuation tribunal, or arbitration proceedings, are not to be regarded as relevant costs to be taken into account in determining the amount of any service charge payable by the tenant or any other person or persons specified in the application.</li>

	<li>The application shall be made—</li>

	<ol>

	<li>in the case of court proceedings, to the court before which the proceedings are taking place or, if the application is made after the proceedings are concluded, to a county court;</li>

	<li>in the case of proceedings before a leasehold valuation tribunal, to the tribunal before which the proceedings are taking place or, if the application is made after the proceedings are concluded, to any leasehold valuation tribunal;</li>

	<li>in the case of arbitration proceedings, the arbitral tribunal or, if the application is made after the proceedings are concluded, a county court.</li></ol>

	<li>(3) The court or tribunal to which the application is made may make such order on the application as it considers just and equitable in the circumstances.".</li></ol></p>

	<p>(6) In section 38 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 (minor definitions), at the appropriate place insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"arbitration agreement", "arbitration proceedings" and "arbitral tribunal" have the same meaning as in Part I of the Arbitration Act 1996;".—[
	<i>Mr. Clappison.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>
	<i>Brought up, and read the First and Second time.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment proposed to the proposed new clause:</i> (d), in subsection (2C)(c), after "tribunal", insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2D) On the consideration of any application by a leasehold valuation tribunal, the tribunal shall disregard all commission which the landlord purports to earn other than which may cover reasonable administrative costs.".—[
	<i>Mr. Ashby.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>

	<p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"The value of the freeholder's opportunity to collect insurance commission was reflected in the prices achieved on the sale of freeholds and no additional value should be included and that the opportunity to collect insurance commissions was not a right intrinsic to the lease itself but dependent on other factors."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to new clause 39 which deals with the important right of first refusal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may help the Committee if I describe the right of first refusal and how our proposals to curb abuses of that right fit in to the leasehold package.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right of first refusal is contained in part I of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987. Many members of the —Committee will be familiar with its provisions, particularly those who were members of the Committee which considered the 1987 Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>922</span>
Part I of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987 requires that freeholders wishing to sell the freehold of a block of flats must first offer it to the qualifying tenants, which include both leaseholders and regulated tenants. If the freeholder fails to do that, the tenants have a right to buy the freehold from the purchaser at the price that he paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee may recall that part I of the 1987 Act arose from the work of the Nugee committee, which reported in 1985. Although it constrained the previous rights of landlords to sell freely, the principle was accepted in many quarters. The British Property Federation, for example, had already given guidance to its members suggesting that they should offer the residents first refusal when disposing of blocks of flats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assumption was, no doubt, that because the price was the same, the freeholder would be as happy to sell to the tenants as to a third party. During the Bill's passage through Parliament, no one suggested that landlords might not fulfil their obligations. The right to buy from the purchaser was perhaps thought to be a sufficient safeguard. In that context, penalties for failing to offer the right of first refusal were considered superfluous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, many vendors have found that it is much cheaper to put the sale in the hands of agents and auctioneers than to commence negotiations with large numbers of tenants, expecially if a portfolio of properties is for sale. There have been some problems with the opportunity for tenants to exercise the right of first refusal, some of which have come to public attention and are well known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although in some ways the abuse of the right of first refusal is a separate issue, there is a strong link with the problem of residential leasehold abuse by rogue landlords which the other new clauses in the group address. The Committee will be familiar with the problem, having considered it this morning. Those rogue landlords, otherwise known as ground rent feeders, obtain the blocks of flats which they exploit from landlords who have not offered their tenants the right of first refusal. Ensuring that the tenants can exercise their right to buy their ground rent is the first limb of our strategy to protect leaseholders, the other being the measures on service changes to help people who have suffered problems, such as those which we discussed this morning, as a result of the activities of bad landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the Government's proposals for dealing with the abuse of the right of first refusal. Subsection (2) of new clause 39 contains the main remedy, inserting new section 5A into the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987, to make it a criminal offence, without reasonable excuse, to make a sale falling within the scope of the Act without first having served the notices required by section 5. That will stop the institutions, portfolio owners, accountants and others who act as receivers for bankrupt companies from ignoring their obligations. They cannot afford to commit criminal offences if they want to retain their reputations. The Committee will also see that officers
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0523">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>923</span>
of bodies corporate can be prosecuted if the offence has been committed with their consent, connivance or neglect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have set the fine on conviction at level 4—a maximum of £2,500. For the institutions and accountants with reputations to preserve, the fact that failing to serve the notices will be a criminal offence will, no doubt, be a considerable deterrent. Receiving a criminal conviction is no light matter, especially for some of those who might be affected by the liability in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Honest landlords who do not know the law should be protected by competent professional advice. Estate agents, auctioneers, solicitors and licensed conveyancers should check with the vendor that the right of first refusal has been offered before handling the sale of a freehold reversion in a block of flats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee may wonder: what if an agent or solicitor knowingly or negligently connives at the commission of the offence? When the offence is discovered and the vendor is prosecuted, those who helped him are at risk of prosecution for aiding and abetting Such a conviction would be no light matter, in particular for those people's professional reputations. One imagines that prudent people would take care to avoid it happening to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made provision for prosecutions to be brought by the local housing authority. That mirrors the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 which allows the local housing authority to prosecute service charge offences. It does not, however, prevent the police and the Crown Prosecution Service from bringing a prosecution for the offence in the normal way if it is considered appropriate. The aggrieved parties would also be able to bring a private prosecution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) of new clause 39 contains the principal remedy, but subsection (1) is also important. It attempts to address the problem caused by avoiding or failing to give the right of first refusal, by creating a new company through the transfer of a freehold to that company, which is associated with the landlord, and then selling shares in that associated company to a preferred purchaser.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exemption for sales to associated companies is necessary to allow groups to carry out corporate restructuring in an orderly way. There is, however, scope for the abuse which have just mentioned, and that must be addressed. It is not easy to think of a way round the problem which will be watertight, but we have, I believe, gone a significant way towards dealing with the most blatant abuses by the measure in subsection (1) of new clause 39. It means that usually the company to which the freehold has been sold must have been associated with the vendor for at least two years before a sale is not considered to be a relevant disposal. We hope that that substantially addresses the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, subsection (3) of new clause 39 means that the measures that I have described will not be retrospective. It would clearly be a huge burden to attempt to unpick the large number of property transactions to which part I of the 1987 Act applies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>924</span>
I now move on to new clause 40. As I have just mentioned, tenants have a right to purchase the freehold or head lease from the new landlord if it has been sold over their heads. The problem is that very few tenants are aware of that and by the time they realise that they had rights, the time limit for exercising them has passed and there is nothing they can do. At present, tenants have either two months in which to serve a notice requesting information about the disposal, or three months to serve a purchase notice on the new landlord. Those time limits start from the time they discover that the transfer has taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tenants will usually find out about the transfer when they receive a notice from the new landlord served under section 3 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, which requires him to notify the tenants of the assignment and to give them his name and address. The penalty for failing to do that is a level 4 fine—a maximum of £2,500. Landlords, of course, rarely fail to serve section 3 notices because they need to tell the tenants where to pay the rent and service charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to consider that from the tenant's point of view. One day, a tenant may receive a letter from a company that he has never heard of saying that it has bought the freehold and that the rent should now be paid to the new landlord. Like most people, he knows nothing about the right of first refusal and will therefore not realise that he and his neighbours have a chance to buy the freehold at a fixed price. He will not realise that unless the tenants act within two or three months, their rights will be lost. Ground-rent feeders rely on that when they buy up freeholds at auction. They are then able to oppress the unsuspecting leaseholders with excessive service charges, as we have already discussed in some detail this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The solution to that problem is contained in new clause 40. When a new landlord has to serve a notice under section 3 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, he must also serve a notice under new section 3A on all qualifying tenants if the sale was within the scope of the 1987 Act. Most important, the notice will say that the disposal was one to which the 1987 Act applied; that the tenant may have rights to obtain information and to acquire the new landlord's interest; that the time limits for action start once a requisite majority of tenants have received the notice; and what those time limits are. That serves to safeguard the tenants' rights and interest by giving them notice of their rights and interest at the appropriate time for them to consider exercising them. The penalty for failure to serve the notice is a level 4 fine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that that procedure will provide that enough tenants will be able to take action once they discover that the freehold of their building has been sold over their heads. It also means that the breach of the primary duty to offer the right of first refusal will not go unnoticed. A notice under new clause 40 can only be served if an offence has been committed under new clause 39. The tenants will know that the guilty party is their previous landlord and can therefore take appropriate action. I commend the new clauses to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Raynsford 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are now dealing with one of the most complex and difficult parts of the Bill. I should like to take time to explore one or two of the complexities relating to sections 5 and 18 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987, which relate to the obligations on landlords to give notices to their leaseholders when a disposal is in the offing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 5 requires landlords proposing to make a disposal to serve a notice on leaseholders informing of their right of first refusal. Section 18 separately provides that prospective purchasers may serve notice on leaseholders to advise them of their right to ensure that the right of first refusal will not arise. Otherwise, purchasers will find themselves in a bizarre position if they seek to acquire properties where leaseholders might exercise their right of first refusal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those laws have been treated with contempt by all too many freeholders. That is not a scaremongering comment from the Labour party, or from leaseholder groups; it is a comment from the Master of the Rolls, Lord Bingham. In judgment on a case brought by a leaseholder called Mainwaring against Smith's Charities. Lord Bingham gave a clear statement of the degreee to which the legislation has failed. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is a notable feature of the section that although it lays a clear mandatory duty on a landlord, there is apparently no sanction against a landlord who fails to comply: in practice, neglect of the statutory duty has been common, and has given rise to considerable litigation."</p></blockquote>
The leaseholders of Smith's Charities were shocked when, last summer, they discovered that their landlord had agreed to dispose of their entire, and very substantial, estate in Kensington to the Wellcome Foundation without complying with their obligations to serve section 5 notices on the leaseholders. That was not an accidental omission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the scenario unfolded, it became clear that Smith's Charities and the Wellcome Foundation had agreed a complex—some would say devious—set of arrangements to deny leaseholders the opportunity to acquire the freehold. That included the claim—which they still advance—that the completion date for the contract that was entered into in July 1995 has still not arrived and is not due to arrive until some date in 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That rather obscure fact is crucial because Smith's Charities argued successfully before the Master of the Rolls that the duty not to dispose of leasehold properties until the leaseholders had been given the right of first refusal only took effect when the contract was completed, rather than when the contract was exchanged. In reaching that decision, which may appear curious, the Master of the Rolls made it clear that the Act was far from helpful. Again, I quote from his judgment. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"With any other Act we would think it extraordinary that doubt should exist on a point as fundamental as this. We have to say that we do not find the answer indicated with an acceptable degree of clarity in the language of the section itself or elswwhere in the Act. it would, however, appear that in subsection (2) of the section the draftsman has been primarily (although not consistently) concerned to exclude as relevant disposals certain forms of final transfer, which may perhaps indicate that it was the final transfer and not the preliminary agreement which he intended to be treated as the relevant disposal."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>926</span>
On that far-from-substantial basis, the Master of the Rolls reached his decision that the effective date was the date on which completion took place, rather than exchange of contracts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cirencester and Tewkesbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman consider that interpretation of the law to be somewhat bizarre? Usually, under property law, one is committed on the date of the contract. Surely, the whole purpose of giving prior notice is to give notice before a contract is entered into. Otherwise, the whole thing is otiose and worthless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree whole-heartedly with the hon. Member. I was about to say precisely that. The judgement is clearly a bizarre one, which flies in the face of usual interpretations of contract law in this country. But it is clear that the Act is hopelessly opaque on the issue. It is just one of many examples in recent landlord and tenant legislation where obscurity and complexity provide a veritable goldmine of loopholes for reluctant landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was certainly so in that case. It provided an easy pretext for Smith's Charities to try to deny their leaseholders the opportunity to buy the freehold. The significance of that delaying mechanism was chillingly highlighted by the leaseholder who challenged Smith's Charities in court—the challenge that led to the Master of the Rolls's judgment. That leaseholder has written and reminded me that the right to carry through the purchase depends on there being a majority of eligible leaseholders willing to purchase. She says in her letter:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The entitlements of my fellow tenants and myself under the 1987 Act were dependent on elderly tenants in their eighties and nineties surviving; two down and we came outside the Act. Mr. Neuberger"—</p></blockquote>
that is the counsel acting for Smith's Charities—
	<br><blockquote><p>"said that the death of elderly tenants was a windfall, of which there was no reason why his clients should not take advantage. As Neuberger is a particularly nice man, I assume he was expressing the views of his clients."</p></blockquote>
I think that will give all members of the Committee serious grounds for thought about the probity and decency of the way in which that large estate has been acting. I hope that it will give us all a sense of outrage and a commitment to achieve effective change in legislation. We cannot allow such cynical manipulation of legislation to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that any Member of the Committee would want to perpetuate a situation in which that can happen. We owe it to leaseholders, whose rights have been denied in this and in other ways, to close the loopholes and ensure that leaseholders can enforce their rights. The Government are trying to do that, but, having considered new clauses 39 and 40, we have come to the conclusion that they are not adequate. They do not tackle the problem of the relevant date—the issue that created confusion in the case of the Smith's Charities judgment, which, as the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury pointed out, seems to fly in the face of normal contract law. That problem remains unresolved by the Government's amendment. I cannot believe that any date other than
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0525">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>927</span>
that of the exchange of contract can have been originally envisaged when the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987 was passed. I sat on the Committee that considered it. It makes a nonsense of proceedings if landlords can frustrate the whole process by dragging out the completion date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Under-Secretary will make it clear that the duties are intended to apply from the date of exchange of contracts. I hope, too, that to avoid further confusion he will agree to table an amendment on Report to make that intention crystal clear in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason for our concern about the adequacy of Government new clauses 39 and 40 is that the penalties they they propose are, as the Undersecretary explained, no greater than level 4, or £2,500. Those are to be fines for large land owning interests that dispose of assets worth tens of millions of pounds. Earlier in the progress of the Bill the Government presented a measure to increase the fine for a homeless applicant, who—either intentionally or because of fear—gives misinformation or fails to provide a relevant fact, to twice that for which some of the country's largest landowners will make themselves liable if they break the law. That defies all logic. I cannot believe that the Government's priorities are so distorted that they can propose fines at level 5 for hapless, homeless families who make a mistake in stressful circumstances, and give false information—when just one home is at stake—while a large landowner who deliberately and wilfully, as in the case that we have been considering, denies thousands of leaseholders the chance to buy their homes, can get away with a penalty of just £2,500. It beggars belief that the Government could do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, as the Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration suggested, he will re-examine the issue of proportionality—and do so quickly. The arrangement that I have outlined offends anyone's instinct for justice. It is not even comparable to the poll tax. At least with that a dustman paid the same as a duke. In this case, a homeless family would pay twice what a duke would—and quite a few dukes are in a position to be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The penalties are derisorily small, and wrong. However, even if they were to be increased—and there is a case for that—we remain unconvinced that a fine would be sufficient deterrent. That is why we have tabled amendment (a), which would make it unlawful for the purchaser to collect any ground rent or service charge until he had complied with the duty to notify tenants under section 18. That, of course, constitutes a really effective penalty. It would put an end to any delaying tactics, because the longer service of the notice was delayed, the longer the purchaser would be debarred from receiving any ground rent or service charges. There would be a direct financial incentive for the new purchaser to serve the notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>928</span>
We thought about tabling an amendment to impose a similar penalty on the landlord who was disposing of the property. The problem with that approach was how to do it. Once the landlord has disposed of the property, all that can be done is to levy a fine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman's amendments were carried, establishing that point could become part of the search that the solicitors would carry out in the course of a purchase. They might have to be satisfied in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and I accept that that is one way in which the issue will be brought to the fore. It is important that it is, because its effect will be to ensure that anyone purchasing will want to be absolutely satisfied that the law has been complied with. That is why we are moving that amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment (b) links the matter to the process spelt out in the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, under which the new purchaser has to inform leaseholders of his identity within two months. Imposing those penalties on a potential purchaser will, we hope, make them far more careful about buying without ensuring that leaseholders are given their rights. It will probably also restrict the scope for organisations such as The Ground Rent Brokers, to which I referred in this morning's sitting, and others which exploit leaseholders to sell leasehold properties without ensuring that section 5 obligations are met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last night, I looked through the brochure of The Ground Rent Brokers and happened to light upon a property in my constituency. I looked at it closely. What did I find? The brochure stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"95 Greenwich South Street, London SE10. 
	<i>Four converted flats</i> sold on 125 year leases from 1988 at a (rising) ground rent of 
	<i>£200 pa.</i> Lessor insures manages and recovers costs from the lessees."</p></blockquote>
Then, after giving a few more technical details, the brochure adds:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Section Five Notices have not been served."</p></blockquote>
I wonder why not. How can any reputable agency sell properties, knowing that there is a legal obligation to serve section 5 notices, while baldly and blatantly stating that they have not been served? How can they not tell their clients that they should be serving such notices? That is what is going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read the rest of the brochure and found that that property was the exception. At least in that case the firm had come clean and stated that the notices had not been served. In most of the other entries, there was no reference to them. My guess is that notices have not been served in most of the others. The current framework is a mess and it must be corrected. There must be proper and effective penalties against landlords who fail to meet their obligations and against agents who exploit the position and fail to ensure that the law is complied with. As I said, the issue was not mentioned in most cases, but I suspect that in almost all of them the notices have not been served.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole area requires far more effective remedy than that which the modest Government proposals will achieve. There is an overriding case for putting
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0526">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>929</span>
right the inadequate state of affairs created by existing legislation. Government new clauses 39 and 40, amended by amendments (a) and (b), will go a long way towards that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 58 is grouped with the amendments to new clauses 39 and 40 and covers one other loophole. It deals with a landlord using the device of an option or pre-emption right to try to evade the provisions. The 1987 Act as currently drafted excludes from the definition of a relevant disposal any disposal
	<br><blockquote><p>"in pursuance of—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(i) any option or right of pre-emption binding on the landlord (whether granted before or after the commencement of this section)".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. I am sorry if the extraordinary complexity of the subject is causing any difficulty. I shall try to take things slowly and carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existing provisions of section 4 state that any disposal
	<br><blockquote><p>"in pursuance of—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(i) any option or right of pre-emption binding on the landlord (whether granted before or after the commencement of this section)"</p></blockquote>
is excluded from the definition of relevant disposal. That makes it easy for a landlord to set up options which can be used as devices for frustrating leaseholders who are seeking to purchase those properties. Our proposal to deal with that involves the restriction of the measure to options which have been granted before the Bill comes into effect. There would be no question of retrospective legislation. Any options granted before the Bill comes into effect could be excluded, but otherwise would not be.

Will that stop the creation of options as devices to get round the law? I am not sure. That is a particularly complicated matter and this is not the first time that the issue has been raised. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser) raised the issue in 1987 in the Committee considering the Landlord and Tenant Bill. He was reassured by the then Minister, the right hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Mr. Patten), that that position was covered by section 4(3) which
	<br><blockquote><p>"provides that the grant of an option…constitutes a disposal which is relevant".—[
	<i>Official Report Standing Committee A,</i> 9 April 1987; c. 18.]</p></blockquote>
So leaseholders would have rights at the stage at which the option was granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am making a meal about that because it links back to the judgment in the Smith's Charities case to which I referred earlier. If that judgment stands, I cannot see how the advice given by the right hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon can be correct. If the completion of the contract, and not the granting of an option is, in practice, the point at which the relevant disposal takes place, tenants cannot have the right of first refusal at the point at which the option is granted.
	<span class='label label-info column'>930</span>
There is a clear logical inconsistency. That is why I ask the Government and the Minister to give a clear undertaking on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is a lawyer, so he will accept that this is a complex matter in which there appears to be a straightforward inconsistency. The assurance that leaseholders would be protected by section 4(3) because the granting of an option would constitute a relevant disposal cannot stand if the judgment in the Smith's Charities and Mainwaring case is upheld. The Master of the Rolls concluded that the duty came to bite only when the contract was completed, not when options were granted or contracts were exchanged. That is a logical inconsistency and a mess. In the interests of leaseholders, that mess must rapidly be sorted out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will give the matter some serious attention between now and the Report stage. I understand that these are complex legal matters and that it would be wise for him to seek further legal advice, so if he cannot give an assurance in the Committee, I hope that he will give an undertaking to return and clarify the matter on Report. I hope that he will do so clarifying the assurances that we were given in 1987, on which most people, including all members of the Committee who have spoken so far, base their assumptions that contract law operates on the presumption that a contract is binding from the date on which it is exchanged, not a future date. That is a basic premise and would allow the interpretation of section 4(3) by the right hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon to stand. It would also help us out of our current difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for going through some extremely complex and difficult material and taking time to do so. However, everyone will appreciate that this is a serious problem, which has caused, and is causing, injustice to many leaseholders. We owe it to them to get the problem sorted out as quickly as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I have not previously said so in the Committee, it is contrary to the spirit of a Government who are committed to deregulation to start imposing criminal fines in what is essentially a civil matter of property law. We will compound the problems that we created for ourselves in the 1987 Act—which is one of the reasons why it has not worked—by imposing criminal sanctions in this way. There is a better civil method for dealing with this matter, which is simply to make it illegal to exchange a contract or grant an option without the prior proper notices having been served.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to have a long, hard look at the new clauses with a view to bringing back amended new clauses on Report. That would be a more effective way of dealing with the problem. A purchaser will not part with a consideration if he has not done the proper legal work

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one small practical problem with new clause 39 that I have already discussed with my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary. It relates to auctions. It is important that the property market retains the option of auctions, but there is the danger that the new clauses would close that option. I hope that my hon. Friend will consider a mechanism so that, when a block of flats is auctioned, a lot could be split up and an individual lessee could be given the option of buying his flat prior to the rest of the block being sold by auction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the danger that illiquidity could be put into the property market if the option of auctions is closed off. If that happened, the market would go down the chain that I described this morning. Prices would drop and more irresponsible landlords, who would not manage their properties as well as responsible landlords, would enter the market. I hope that prior to Report my hon. Friend will consider how he could amend new clause 39 to accommodate that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr Clifton-Brown) has hit on the very point that I was considering. I also totally agree with the points made by the hon. Member for Greenwich.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A fine of level 4 would be far too low. In any event, taking civil property matters into the realm of the criminal law is not the right way forward. The right way is to be found in amendments (a) and (b). When a landlord has disposed of a property without giving the requisite notice, that almost amounts to a non-disposal. The landlord has flown in the face of the existing law and, if he has not served the requisite notices, the wrong person may purchase the property. If that person has not bothered to make searches, he should not be entitled to any benefits of the sale. I cannot think of a more powerful sanction. It would put a stop to all rogue landlords and all rogue sales at a stroke. It is brilliant and the right way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am convinced that use of the criminal law is not the right approach. I should like to see its use scrapped and a substitute proposed. I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will consider that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, notice should be served at the time of exchange. An option is exactly the same as a contract. If one wants to achieve anything in the sale and disposal of a block of flats at an auction, one should serve the necessary notice beforehand so that leaseholders have an opportunity to take part. I strongly support what Opposition Members have said. I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will take on board those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am somewhat concerned that the debate is shifting to an area in which we are being asked to believe that difficulties with the Leasehold and Tenant Act 1987 are the exclusive preserve of what hon. Members have called "rogue landlords". I wish to rectify that view because of what has happened to many of my constituents, and especially a group of tenants who live in Hylda Court in my constituency. Hylda Court was on a list of properties for sale by the Liverpool Victoria Friendly Society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury is not in Committee at present, but I shall make my point. He was averring that sales would not be entered into without lawyers making relevant inquiries and ensuring that the requirements of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987 had been abided by. I shall quote from the second paragraph on page 2 of the prospectus issued by the Liverpool Victoria Friendly Society for the sale of almost a dozen properties. Under the headline "Landlord and Tenant Act 1987", it said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is likely that all of the individual investments, and in some instances individual blocks, fall within the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>However, Liverpool Victoria Friendly Society, as vendors, do not propose to serve any Notices under Section 5 of the Act, once terms are agreed for a sale. Further, it will be a condition of the contract that the purchaser will not serve any Notices under the Act until after completion has occurred."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, as my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich said, that is scandalous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to a letter, copies of which were sent to the Secretary of State for the Environment and, indeed, to the Prime Minister, from my constituent, Mr. Bruce, for and on behalf of the Hylda Court Tenants Association. It stated that Hylda court was sold as one of 15 similar properties
	<br><blockquote><p>"in a deal worth some £22.7 million".</p></blockquote>
I am not talking about small change, but major property deals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similar failures took place on the part of Eton College Estates. Fortunately, that situation has changed, but it has done so only in the past year. Eton College Estates were selling their properties and flouting the right of first refusal to their tenants. Frogmore Estates bought the property from the Liverpool Victoria Friendly Society. In a letter to me, Mrs. Bruce, who also speaks on behalf of the Hylda Court Tenants Association said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the meantime Frogmore Estates have mounted a campaign of harassment against the tenants of Hylda Court, since thay are confident that we do not have the resources to enter into litigation with them. This has involved refusal to accept rent from individual tenants … persistent disruption of central services such as hot water and central heating."</p></blockquote>
In the first letter to which I referred, Mr. Bruce also mentioned Frogmore Estates and said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are currently appealing against new registered rents that have been increased at some 10 times or more the rate of inflation. Some 35 per cent. of the tenants of Hylda Court are either pensioners, invalids, unemployed or otherwise low-paid or ill-equipped to deal with such rises".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0528">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>933</span>
My constituent is aware that attempts are being made to change the law and argues that such changes should be retrospective with regard to landlords who are in breach of the Landlord and Tenant 1987. The Minister has already said that the Government have no proposals for such action to the retrospective. However, it is important for the Committee not to be lulled into believing that such gross abuses are limited to rogue landlords. Such practice has become almost endemic. Some of what from their names I would regard as the most respectable estate owners in London have been deliberately flouting the law and have brought grievous damage on their tenants. Those tenants have, as far as is humanly possible, attempted to maintain their side of the contract—about which we have heard so much, and which some Conservative members of the Committee appear to regard as the 11th Commandment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Freeholders are abusing their tenants. In the case that I mentioned—Hylda Court—the original freeholder who sold on to Frogmore Estates had failed to maintain the property for a considerable period. When it was independently valued by the tenant, the tenant was told that it had been sold for half of what was deemed to be its market value. The tenant perceives that the present freeholders want to empty the block so that they can obtain the market value by having vacant possession. That situation is extremely serious and on-going, and it concerns an area of the property market which does not, on the face of it, involve a rogue or less than respectable element. Estate managers are still deliberately and consistently flouting the law. We should consider that fact before we reach a decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate that we have had on this group of new clauses and amendments has revealed a great a deal of common ground across the Committee. We all share the objective of seeking to ensure that tenants enjoy the right of first refusal that Parliament intended them to have. I agree with many of the sentiments that have been expressed on the matter. It is not an attractive prospect to see the sort of rogue landlords about whom we have been talking deprive tenants of their right of first refusal. Equally, it is not an attractive prospect to see large and ostensibly respectable institutions doing likewise. I share the sentiments that have been expressed in Committee and in another place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To deal briefly with the contribution of the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson), I am aware of the case to which she referred, and of the facts of that case. I know that she has been keen to draw attention to it. I share the view that it represents a blatant flouting of the law, and of tenants' rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Greenwich raised the court case of Smith's Charities. As he rightly said, that involves an area of considerable complexity. He raised an important point about the the way that the operation of the principle is being affected by the question of the time of relevant disposal. I also noted the important comments of my hon. Friend the
	<span class='label label-info column'>934</span>
Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury, who has experience of the matter, on which I will indeed reflect carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Member for Greenwich will understand that in such a complex area, I want to reflect upon the matter. But I shall do so—this also applies to other matters—against a background of wanting to ensure that the right of first refusal can be effectively used by tenants and that Parliament's intention is not defeated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Greenwich also raised the question of penalties, and made some colourful comparisons concerning the level of penalties. We have considered the subject in other contexts in Committee. The hon. Gentleman knows that my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration has already said that we are prepared to review penalties—to consider the consistency of penalties across the Bill. The penalty in this case is one of £2,500. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the maximum fine in a magistrates court on scale 5 is a fine of £5,000. The hon. Gentleman made the point that for large institutions that is a relatively small amount, and we are aware that substantial sums can be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to proposed new subsection (3) of section 4 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987, which will extend liability to individuals. In cases where tenants right of first refusal has been flouted, not just the body corporate but individuals will face stringent criminal liability. They will have to face the fact that if they flout the law and incur criminal liability, they may be prosecuted and brought before the courts, with all the stigma that that can rightly attract. The matter will not be treated lightly and should not be regarded as merely a business risk. That prospect should influence otherwise respectable people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It would be better not to have a criminal sanction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That, too, deserves further consideration. My first reaction is that our purpose is to ensure that the tenants have the right of first refusal.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend reflect on amendment (a) to new clause 40, tabled by the hon. Member for Greenwich? It has considerable attractions for me and other members of the Committee, who view it as the right way forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will deal with amendment (a) shortly. I do not know whether I will be able to compete with all the attractions that my hon. Friend perceives, but I will do my best to respond to the important matters that have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the legitimate concern expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury about the property market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some sympathy with the thrust of amendment (a) to new clause 40. The hon. Member for Greenwich outlined the case where a purchaser has served a notice informing the tenants of the assignment, but has failed to serve the new section 3A notice introduced by new clause 40.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although some tenants will know about the right of first refusal, many will not. That is why we have introduced new clause 40. The clock will not start to run for the exercise of the right until the tenants have been informed. I think, therefore, that the right to withhold rent and service charges may not be used in those circumstances. It would require tenants to know that they had not been informed of rights of which they were unaware. If they are aware of their rights, they can exercise them, even if the notice under new section 3A is not served.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee of the provisions of sections 47 and 48 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987. Tenants will know if the landlord has omitted his name and address from a demand for rent, or they do not have an address for the service of notices. It will then be feasible for them to withhold payments until the requisite notices have been served. That is considered sufficient punishment for failure to comply with those provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, as I said, we have already introduced the penalty of a criminal sanction if a purchaser fails to serve the notice informing tenants of their rights. In those circumstances, notwithstanding any attractions, I do not believe that the amendment is advisable. I must therefore resist it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment (b) is interesting. I understand that it effectively deletes section 11(2)(b) of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987, as substituted by new section (2) of new clause 40. It means that only notices served under section 3 A of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 will trigger the time limits for the exercise of tenants' rights under the 1987 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that something is missing from the hon. Gentleman's argument. New section 3A applies only when a new landlord is taking over the property. There are circumstances in which the tenants have rights under the 1987 Act, but the 1985 Act does not apply. That is important because those circumstances include the grant of an option—I shall deal with that in a moment—which is relevant to new clause 58. I advise the Committee to resist amendment (b) because it would not achieve the appropriate coverage in such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>936</span>
The hon. Member for Greenwich dealt with what might happen on the exercise of an option when speaking to new clause 58. He rightly said that that was a matter of some complexity, and he was concerned about whether the provisions would bite on the granting of an option or the exercise of an option. In the brief time that I had while listening to the hon. Gentleman's speech, I read the report of the speech that he made—to which he referred earlier—in April 1987 in the Standing Committee that considered the Landlord and Tenant Bill. After that brief reading, I was better informed, but no wiser—to use an old legal adage—because this is a complex matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to avoid loopholes so I shall reflect upon the matter with a view to ensuring that the right of first refusal is made effective. I think that I have dealt with all the matters that have been raised. Government new clauses 39 and 40 make an important contribution to upholding tenants' right of first refusal, which is a common objective of the Committee and many other people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his helpful response on new clause 58. There is a general spirit in the Committee of wanting to close an obvious loophole and deal with an absolute anomaly as regards the effective date from which the right bites. There is consensus in the Committee that the right should bite from the date on which either the contract is exchanged or the option is granted, not from the later date on which completion is achieved or the option is exercised. We must clarify that matter if leaseholders are not to be left in the lurch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed with the Under-Secretary's response to amendment (a), which has earned support among his hon. Friends. Amendment (a) is a simple but extremely effective mechanism, which would ensure compliance with the law. It would turn off the income stream from the potential purchaser, who would therefore have nothing to gain from any proposal from the vendor to deny tenants the right of first refusal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will press amendemnt (a) to a Division because the Under-Secretary is not prepared to consider it. I shall be sorry to do that because I thought that there was a growing consensus about the need to close the loopholes, however, we must make the point that there must be an effective remedy and a way to prevent freeholders from denying leaseholders their rights and getting away with it because there is no serious financial penalty. That might effect one or two individuals who might face a £2,500 fine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can hardly believe that the Ground Rent Brokers and others of that nature will be the least bit perturbed by a £2,500 fine, they make a fortune from disposing of properties in a way that runs completely counter to the law. The remedy that turns off the income stream and makes it impossible for people to collect their service charges and ground rents until they have

complied is the effective remedy; it is widely seen to be the best answer, and I invite the Committee to vote for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not quite sure why we are now dealing with rental deposit schemes, which have nothing to do with resales. Nevertheless, we are debating a subject of real concern to private tenants and I suppose that in a curious way it shows the bizarre position that we are in with regard to the law in this country. Landlord and tenant relations is a term that is used to describe either the relationship between a leaseholder and the leaseholder's freeholder or between a tenant and a landlord. Perhaps it is symptomatic of the confusion in our current law that, in the middle of a debate on matters of leasehold, we have returned to something that most of us consider to be more appropriate in the context of the private rented sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[MR. DAVID HANSON 
	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for the introduction of a rental deposit scheme in each area of the country is strong. That is the purpose of the new clause. The return of rental deposits is one of the most common forms of landlord and tenant disputes. We have evidence from citizens advice bureaux saying that it constitutes the largest single source of complaints that they receive about housing matters. It is a serious matter and the rental deposit scheme deals with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since January 1989, almost all new private tenancies have been assured or assured shorthold tenancies. For such tenancies, there is no statutory control on the amount of deposit that a landlord can charge. Many tenants pay to their landlords security deposits, which are held as security against rent arrears, damage to property or the removal of furniture. There is no legal obligation for those security deposits to be held in a separate account. That is a curious omission because usually when people hold money on behalf of another person there is a requirement to hold it in a separate account. But there is no such obligation in this instance. Consequently, often at the end of the tenancy
	<span class='label label-info column'>942</span>
when the tenant seeks the return of his or her deposit and the landlord refuses, there is a massive row, but there is no legal framework for determining that row. Indeed, there are often rows about why interest has not been obtained on the money that has been held as a deposit by the landlord throughout the period. There are also rows over alleged breaches of the tenancy for which the landlord proposes to retain part or all of the deposit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence from the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux shows that there are quite flagrant abuses of the system in many cases. A CAB client in the London area paid a letter agency a holding deposit of £200 for one property, but was not able to move in because the previous occupier never left. The person then signed an assured shorthold agreement on a second property and was required to pay a £600 deposit. The agency let that second property to someone else and refused to refund both deposits. That is a scandalous abuse of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[MR. JOHN MCWILLIAM 
	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A similar case was referred to the citizens advice bureau in Gloucestershire. Whether it was in the constituency of the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury I do not know. The CAB told us of a client's daughter in Gloucestershire being shown a property by a letting agency and agreeing to pay a £380 deposit and a £67 surcharge. She was later told by the agent that a mistake had been made and that the deposit and surcharge should total more than £800. She could not afford that. The agents told her that they would not refund the money that she had already paid. The local citizens advice bureau took the matter up on her behalf, but reported to NACAB that various clients had reported similar difficulties with that agency. These are not one-off, occasional problems. There is widespread evidence of abuse of the system, but I shall not weary the Committee by going through it all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are arrangements in various areas to try to overcome the problem. In earlier debates, we considered aspects of policy in various parts of the country, and reference has been made to some of the good practices of a number of authorities that have tried to encourage private landlords through private landlord schemes. Brighton council has been exemplary; I was in Brighton only a week ago and saw one more empty property being brought into use through the council's arrangements with private landlords. The rental deposit arrangement is an important part of the scheme and gives a framework in which the landlord is assured that the money for the deposit is held and the tenant is equally assured that the money is being held by a responsible third party and that, providing the tenant does not wreck the property or cause damage or otherwise forfeit the deposit, he or she can expect back the deposit, plus interest, at the end of the tenancy period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the basis of the rental deposit scheme. A responsible third party acts as intermediary and holds the deposit. The landlord has a safeguard against damage, failure to pay rent or any other breach while,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0533">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>943</span>
conversely, the tenant has the reassurance that he or she will not simply find a brick wall at the end of the tenancy when requesting return of the deposit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that about 100 local authorities participate in schemes to provide rent guarantees to private landlords, helping those who cannot raise a rent deposit to raise the money, and holding it in third party hands to make sure that there is no risk of abuse. The Government have backed such schemes recently by issuing a general consent to make it simpler for local authorities to offer schemes of this nature as part of a commitment to making the private rented sector work better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would build on that by giving local authorities new powers to establish independent custodial services for rental deposits. These could be run by local authorities or other organisations. We take no view on who should run them; the important thing is that it should be a reputable independent body—that is the key to the schemes' success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are lessons from abroad. New South Wales state set up a bond board that provides a similar service and it has been enormously successful. It has been extended to other Australian states and similar schemes have been developed in Canada and New Zealand. The board has proved cheap, quick, effective and popular with estate agents and tenants. It has taken much of the controversy out of landlord-tenant relations and is self-financing—indeed, it generates income. All the operating costs are paid from the interest earned from the investment of resident deposit money held in trust. I am not certain, but I suspect that the down side of that is that the tenants do not receive the interest when they are given the deposit back.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: They do not receive all the interest. However, the system provides the financing arrangements for the rental deposit scheme without the need for any public money and it seems a sensible approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the bond money received by landlords is deposited with the rental bond board and at the end of the tenancy either party can claim the deposit. If the landlord does not claim it within seven days, the full bond is returned to the tenant. Evidence suggests that the return of deposits is, on the whole, dealt with satisfactorily. Far from being bureaucratic, the system speeds up the process. The most recent year for which we have figures is 1993–94, when 76 per cent. of cases were straightforward agreements between both parties with no dispute. In 24 per cent. of cases, the board had to write to one party to reach agreement on the return of the deposit. In the great majority of those cases, agreement was reached. In only 1.8 per cent. of cases was there a need for a tribunal decision to resolve a dispute between the parties on the return or non-return of the deposit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is very impressive evidence from overseas. The amendment would speed up and facilitate the introduction of similar arrangements in this country, which would help to establish a proper framework for
	<span class='label label-info column'>944</span>
tenants looking for deposits and landlords wanting reassurance that they will have a deposit against the possible risks of letting their homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme is straightforward and should be in place in every area of the country. The new clause would make that possible by requiring every authority to operate—or make arrangements for an independent body to operate—a rental deposit scheme. This commonsense measure would take a great deal of hassle out of landlord-tenant relations. It would help responsible private renting—an objective shared on both sides of the House. We all want good landlords to be letting good quality accommodation to good tenants. Any measure which helps that process should be welcomed. I hope that the Minister will accept the new clause and build on it. In doing so, he would help to further the Government's objective of reviving the private rented sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have reflected on the issue philosophically for some weeks. I let a flat and am the tenant of another landlord. That seems an odd combination, but I had to flee my flat to escape the clutches of the popular press after they hacked into various computers to find out where I was within a few weeks. That is the way in which they behave because they believe that they are above the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I let my home through a reputable estate agent. I knew very little about the mechanism of letting, because the estate agent dealt with that for me. I have two delightful tenants whom I cannot praise enough. They are splendid tenants. I know that they have paid a deposit, which I believe to be nearly £1,000.1 had to pay a slightly larger deposit to the landlord of the premises that I am currently occupying. I do not see my £1,000, nor does my landlord see his £1,000 because the money has been paid to and is held by reputable agents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am talking about big agents and, when I reflected on how much money my agent might have on deposit, I thought, "Gosh, it must be about £13 million or £14 million at least. Would not I love to have £13 million or £14 million of deposit money? I would be in an absolutely super position." Of course, I would pay it back, but I could go to the bank manager and say, "At any time I have £13 million or £14 million, so you have to deal with me in a certain way. I am not going to have charges, or this, that or the other. I expect to receive interest on that money, and I want interest at a very favourable rate." I have not seen my estate agent's accounts, but the interest—which might not even be hidden—must be substantial. The bottom line on my account would be substantial as a result of other people's money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought long and hard about that and began to make inquiries. I discovered that £1 billion is being held on deposit in various places by various estate agents. That is a lot of money, and a lot of interest is accruing to estate agents. Coming from the legal profession, I know that lawyers are not allowed to do that. They have to put client money into a separate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0534">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>945</span>
account and return it with interest, which they have to pay on money that they hold. One gets one's money back and one's interest paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I go to my landlords in a month's time, will I get the interest? No, not a hope. They have held £1,000 or more of mine for more than two years. Just think of it, Mr. McWilliam. If interest is 2 per cent. or 1 per cent. above base rate, how much should I be getting back? We can be quite sure that my agents have been getting a substantial sum on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not regulated estate agents. I am not referring to letting agents, but to big estate agents such as Cluttons, John D. Woods and Chestertons, which must be holding substantial amounts of tenants' money on deposit. Although I am not especially attracted to new clause 23—I do not believe that the sort of money that I am talking about should be held by local authorities—I want the Minister to think carefully about what I am saying. Perhaps interest should be paid on deposit money. As I said, I have the most marvellous tenants. They are a young, delightful couple with friends and so on. My agents have been holding their £1,000 for eight months. I will be so embarrassed when they get that money back with no interest on it but, as I have not been holding it, I will not have the opportunity to pay the interest owed to them. I only wish that I had, but the thought occurred to me belatedly. I do not believe, however, that either party would want landlords to hold money that is usually held by estate agents, so it is them that we must look to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to take on board what I have said and to give great consideration to the security of deposits and to the mechanism by which they are held so that the interest on deposits can properly be paid to those who have put the money on deposit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Diana Maddock 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. Like the hon. Member for Greenwich, I have been well acquainted with the Australian and Canadian schemes by the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux and by my local citizens advice bureau in Christchurch. There is no doubt that deposits create problems for vulnerable people in the private rented sector. If the Housing Bill is to become the new Act, ans if there is to be growth in the private rented sector as a means of housing people who might be in great need or who are homeless, the last thing we want is to lose the deposit money that we have got together to help those people and to be unable to use it again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Greenwich talked about bringing empty properties back into use. That is a policy that the Liberal Democrats support and are putting into action up and down the country. That is an important part of bringing as many properties as possible into use for housing the many people on waiting lists throughout the country. The new clause would be a useful new way of encouraging the private rented sector and making people feel confident about being housed in that sector, especially those who are on low incomes. It appears that some people will move
	<span class='label label-info column'>946</span>
around quite a lot within the private rented sector, many of whom will not have a lot of money. The loss of a deposit might mean that they are unable to move on to another property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a tremendous amount of case history on this subject. Citizens advice bureaux give good support to a scheme of this sort. Like the hon. Member for Greenwich, I do not believe that it matters whether or not the local authority carries out the scheme, as long as it is carried out by a reputable group. Such a scheme would do a great deal to mitigate some of the pronlems that we fear might arise in the private rented sector as a result of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Every now and again in our proceedings, a gem of an amendment or new clause has come along based on the proposition that all sides can win. This is one of them: both tenants and landlords are protected and the Government might eventually save money as fewer people go through the small claims courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You were not with us this morning, Mr. McWilliam, when we talked about the scams associated with the matters dealt with in earlier new clauses. Deposits have been used as a scam by some landlords. People are given receipts on tatty bits of papers by landlords who say that they will hold the deposit, but who have no intention of repaying it at the end of the tenancy. When people cited to deny them. Landlords say that dilapidated accomodation is the tenant's fault, or that they caused repairs to be necessary—all sorts of reasons and barriers are put in the way of the money being repaid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perfectly sensible to set up a system whereby an independent body holds deposits. Tenancy agreements can clearly show the circumstances under which the deposit will not be repaid. Everybody can be clear about where they stand. My hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock) have said that the Government are making greater use of the private rented sector because they are not prepared to suggest housing by any other means. The measure before the Committee is a positive step, as I hope the Minister will recognise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Association of Residential Letting Agents also feels that it is a good idea because some people do not pay their last month's rent because they know that they will not get their deposit back—another form of the scam. I hope that the Minister recognises that the new clause is worthwhile and should be supported.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe) and I both have the great good fortune of being natives of the same county. Despite what is sometimes said about natives of Yorkshire, I have to admit that when I hear a proposal being advanced as one whereby everyone can win—that application will be universal and that something will be got for nothing—a little alarm bell rings somewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to illustrate why the alarm bell should ring, I shall take as my starting point the Housing Act 1988. That Act relaxed the restrictions on the level of deposit that a landlord can charge in order to encourage
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0535">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>947</span>
landlords to let their property. We believe that we were right to make this change. Research for the Department of the Environment that was published last year shows that damage to property and theft of furniture, fixtures and fittings is a common concern for landlords. The amount of deposit paid is of course a matter for negotiation. However, if the landlord charges more than two months' rent, the tenant may have paid a premium which would give him the right to assign the tenancy to someone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To go into more detail, the new clause would allow a local authority or an authorised body to register and to hold all rental and deposit moneys that are charged by local landlords in an area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several features of the new clause catch the eye, among them the inclusion of rental moneys—which raises a query in mind—and the sweeping and extensive requirements about deposits, which would be compulsory for all landlords. I listened with interest to the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (Mr. Ashby), which was about estate agents. About 30 per cent. of lettings are done through estate agents; the majority of lettings are done by landlords directly. Most of those landlords—whom all members of the Committee want to encourage—have only one or two properties to rent. The new clause would apply to all those landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have doubts about the practicalities of the proposals of the hon. Member for Greenwich. The English house condition survey shows that three quarters of tenants are on good terms with their landlords, that one fifth are on neither good nor bad terms and that only 4 per cent. are on bad terms with their landlords. It would be surprising if more than a small minority of tenants and landlords who were on good or indifferent terms with their landlord during the tenancy got into a dispute at the end of the tenancy about the deposit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause appears to be all embracing—it seems to take in all cases, including those about which there is no dispute. That would involve a local authority or a body that is authorised by an authority to register or to hold deposits. That is likely to make the situation more complicated and to slow down arrangements that are, in many cases, already working satisfactorily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts (Sheflield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual, the Under-Secretary is giving as many technical reasons as he can think of to explain why the scheme cannot work and is not necessary. Does he accept that in some cases there is a need for protection for tenants—for example, when landlords refuse to pay back deposits, although proper receipts exist? Has the Under-Secretary got any proposals to deal with such problems?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am going to turn to tenants. The hon. Gentleman has a habit of merging matters of principle with what he calls matters of technicality. It is more than a technicality that the new clause is all embracing and would set up a substantial apparatus. That matter cannot be dismissed by sleight of hand. It would affect substantial numbers of landlords and tenants and create additional regulations—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>948</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was more concerned about the fact that the Under-Secretary will dismiss some very pressing problems by sleight of hand and not attempt to solve them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not trying to do that. Members of the Committee surely do not want to create unnecessary and cumbersome regulations, and I am sure that we are all concerned about the scope and extent of the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the point that the hon. Gentleman raised, I turn to cases in which there is a dispute. The hon. Gentleman should accept that many landlord-tenant relationships work satisfactorily and that there is no point in impinging on those relationships through regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When there are disputes, the key problem is to find a speedy and effective means of resolving who has the best claim to the deposit money. There will be cases where the landlord has a legitimate claim to some or all of the deposit to cover theft or damage. In other cases, the tenant will have legitimate reasons to expect the full deposit back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not clear how the new clause would deal with disputes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will recall my description of the experience in New South Wales. The evidence is that that system has been overwhelmingly successful—I believe that the number of disputes was reduced to 1.8 per cent. That compares with the situation in this country where all hon. Members, through their constituency casework, and citizens advice bureaux are inundated with cases of protracted and unpleasant disputes because the present system is not working. Surely the Government must accept that there is a need to do something, and surely the New South Wales experience is worthy of our consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.15 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are always prepared to consider the experience of other countries but we must deal with the Bill's proposals. I do not dispute that problems arise in some cases and, no doubt, Members of Parliament encounter such problems in their constituency surgeries, but the fact remains that the English house condition survey to which I referred, shows that only 4 per cent. of tenants regard themselves as being on bad terms with their landlords. A large number of relationships are working satisfactorily, all of which would be brought within the scope of the hon. Gentleman's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However many disputes there are, and whatever the scale of the problem, we must consider what the clause intends should happen in those cases. Is it the intention that the local authority should have the power to act in lieu of the courts? If so, I do not believe that that is appropriate. If not, I fail to see what benefit it can bring. The Committee should bear in mind the solutions currently available to tenants, especially through the small claims courts, which offer a cheap and relatively simple way of dealing with such disputes. If a claim is uncontested, there is no need for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0536">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>949</span>
a court hearing. If it is contested, the amount in dispute is likely to be sufficiently small for the hearing to be dealt with under the informal small claims arbitration procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasie that we recognise that rent deposit and guarantee schemes can play an important role in helping people without resources to pay a deposit to gain access to private rented accommodation. For that reason, we have actively encouraged local authorities to set up or promote rent deposit and guarantee schemes in their areas. We have provided a general consent under section 24 of the Local Government Act 1988 so that authorities do not need to apply to the Department for specific approval for their schemes. Schemes are now operating in more than 100 local authorities. That is somewhat different from the proposals in the new clause, which are regulatory. I listened to what the hon. Member for Greenwich said about regulation and the private rented sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened to the Under-Secretary saying that the Government have taken certain steps to allow local authorities to set up schemes. But they cause so many problems and are such a bad idea, why do the Government allow local authorities to continue to operate them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman fails to see the difference between the schemes that we have promoted and the compulsory apparatus that the clause would put in place. That is an important distinction, not a technicality. However, the hon. Gentleman and I can make common cause in our concern to see a healthy private rented sector. I hope that he appreciates the growth of the private rented sector in recent years, which has been a result of the reforms that have been introduced. I appreciate that he is knowledgeable about the history of housing legislation, but it would take a great deal of argument to convince me that it was self-evident that regulation had been a good thing for the private rented sector. I think that the Committee would wish to avoid similar traps in this legislation. Therefore, I resist the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed. The Minister seems to be totally complacent. I do not think that he appreciates the scale of the problem in this country. The Environment Select Committee is examining the question of housing need. It is now generally accepted that we need about 4.4 million extra dwellings to be made available for occupation between now and the year 2010. That is a formidable target. It means that we must ensure that at least all the existing housing stock is well used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative members of the Committee go on about councils that have a bad record on reletting properties. Most councils have done remarkably well and have got the vacancy level down to a low rate. By the time someone has given notice and been allocated a new property, the length of time that the property is vacant is minimal. However, there are very large numbers of empty dwellings in the private sector, which could be let, some for relatively short periods
	<span class='label label-info column'>950</span>
and others for longer. The problem is that two groups of people circulate stories about the problems involved. First, owners hear tales about the way in which some tenants do a lot of damage and any income from rent is lost in putting right the damage. Whenever such a story circulates in a constituency, another group of people is put off the idea of letting property. Equally, a substantial number of people—they continually come to my advice bureau—have been ripped off because they have not received their deposit back. So another group of people is frightened of the process. I had hoped that the Under-Secretary would explain how those groups will be reassured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is crucial to ensure that people receive their deposit back. The Under-Secretary referred to the small claims court. He may have had some success in the small claims court, but I repeatedly see constituents who have been to the small claims court or whose lawyers have pursued the matter and obtained a judgment, but they did not get their money back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example of one constituent who saw me recently. She was upset because she had recently split up with her former partner. They had been buying a house together. Her former partner had convinced her that as they had both gone back to live with their parents they would have problems paying the mortgage and the simplest solution was to let the property. A deposit was obtained and so on. The first problem was that her former partner did not tell the building society that the property was being let, which was in breach of their agreement. Secondly, he kept the rent but did not pay the building society, so the building society quickly moved to repossession and the young man then disappeared. He cleared off with the deposit and several months' rent, leaving his ex-partner with the debt to the building society and demands from the tenant to repay the deposit. Sooner or later the young man may turn up in another part of the country and may win the national lottery so that the money can be repaid. But I doubt that anyone will get any money back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once a tale such as that circulates in a constituency such as mine, three or four other people decide that they do not want to risk getting into a similar mess. That is the problem that the new clause of my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich attempts to cover. It may not be ideal, but at least he has put forward a proposal. The Government do not show any enthusiasm for dealing with the problem. If we are to avoid tearing up large chunks of the countryside to provide enough dwellings for people, we must ensure that the existing supply is used to its maximum. People should be encouraged to let privately owned property which is empty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary should consider the new clause. If he cannot respond today, he should at least respond on Report with a Government solution if he is not prepared to accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very disappointed with the Under-Secretary's response. We tabled the amendment in a conciliatory spirit, pointing out that there is a common concern to try to improve
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0537">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>951</span>
conditions in the private rented sector and to deal with problems. We describe the benefits and quoted examples from overseas, but in response our idea was rubbished. Those who know about the experience in New South Wales and other countries and who have watched the success of schemes that have been nurtured by good local authorities that have tried to develop them on a voluntary basis here will be astonished at the Under-Secretary's negative line on rental deposit schemes. He has written them off as regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such schemes are designed to take some of the hassle out of landlord-tenant relations. Wherever good schemes are run to bring private landlords into a closer relationship with local authorities, housing associations and other housing bodies to spread the benefit—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not at cross purposes. I tried to make clear that rent deposit and guarantee schemes can play an important role. The difference between the hon. Gentleman's views and mine concerns the sweeping nature of his scheme, which would be compulsory for all landlords and tenants and would amount to regulation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause would require local authorities to draw up schemes for their areas. It would not impose a single scheme, or require schemes to conform to certain principles. It would be open to local authorities to develop it in consultation with local private landlords, particularly where there were landlords' forums. Good authorities have such forums and I have addressed some. They are very encouraging bodies. They bring together people who have previously seen each other as enemies. They creatively consider ways to overcome problems and try to tackle the practical issues that create difficulties in landlord and tenant relations. In that context I can envisage many private landlords being delighted at the creation of a framework to remove one more hassle from their lives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's point about deposit schemes in general and I agree that in certain circumstances they are advantageous. However, the key point is that the new clause specifies that bodies would hold
	<br><blockquote><p>"all rental and deposit monies charged by landlords".</p></blockquote>
That will catch all landlords, whether or not they want to take advantage of such a scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course schemes are established with the desire that they should work throughout their area. A partial scheme clearly will not receive the desired degree of participation. For example, the Association of Residential Letting Agents has a code of conduct for its agents, all of whom it requires to comply with the conditions for holding rental deposits. They operate schemes. That is not voluntary, but is a condition of being registered with ARLA. I am sure that the Under-Secretary will write that off as regulation, but it is necessary to ensure that roques do not get round the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>952</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be at cross purposes with the hon. Gentleman on the matter, and generate unnecessary conflict. Although I take issue with the drafting of the new clause, the Government attach importance to rental deposit schemes and are prepared, for example, to consider the evidence from overseas, to investigate possible advantages. I cannot accept the new clause as it is drafted, but I do not want to engage in unnecessary conflict about the concept of rental deposit schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted with the death-bed repentance that is being made at the end of the debate. The Under-Secretary is beginning to offer a slightly more emollient response to the new clause, having rubbished it for a quarter of an hour. Now we learn that there may be some merit in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause provides a way forward for a sector of the rented market that is still desperately fragile. The Under-Secretary referred to a recovery in the market. There has been a welcome recovery in recent years, but most experts take the view that that is essentially the product of two factors: the depressed state of the owner-occupied market, which has led people to rent properties out rather than sell them at a loss, and, conversely, to rent rather than buy, for fear of finding themselves facing negative equity; and, secondly, the stimulus created by the business expansion scheme, which brought a substantial number of properties on to the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Virtually all experts in the subject express a worry that if the private home ownership market recovers, lettings could disappear from the private rented market. That fragile recovery could disappear. It is in all our interests to try to restore confidence. One way to do that is to tackle the thorny issue of rental deposits. That is a practical, sensible approach, that has worked well in many other parts of the world. It works well where it has already been initiated by local authorities. We want that good practice to be extended through the rest of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am astonished that the Government are not with us on the new clause and that they do not approach it in a positive frame of mind. I invite my hon. Friends to vote in favour of new clause 23.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that we are late. I do not want to detain the Committee for too long. New clauses 49 and 50, particularly new clause 49, are almost my raison d'être for being on the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spoke on Tuesday about my philosophical differences with the Government on the basis of leasehold interests and how I felt there was a scam on the part of those who have something that is in short supply. They are able to renew the value on their property, having sold it several times over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned the sale by the Duchy of Cornwall of a leasehold interest for 99 years at a price of £350,000, which is on the market at the moment. Having spoken, I re-examined the advertisement. The property is a Georgian house. I thought about that carefully. That property has undoubtedly been on a long leasehold ever since it was built. At today's prices, £1.1 million has been paid for that property over the years because no doubt the Duchy received the equivalent value 99 years ago, and 99 years before that. On a property that is worth £350,000 today, the Duchy has already received twice that value. It will now receive it for the third time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0539">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>955</span>
That is wrong and illustrates my philosophical reasons for disliking leasehold tenancies. However, I go further. In the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, we introduced the concept of marriage value. The Committee should ask whether that was a good concept because we seem to be, if I may use a pun, wedded to it. On reflection, and after seeing how it has worked over the past few years, I am convinced that the concept is wrong. I can understand marriage values being necessary in 1993 to persuade their lordships to pass the Bill, albeit having been rather mauled about. That concept is part of the leasehold concept of the valuation of property. It is not a modern criterion and the concept behind it goes against normal business practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a point of order, I raised a case that was in the valuation tribunal. I did so because the tribunal was also saying that interest, commissions and so on should not be reflected in the price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now come to another point in the same case, which involved a house in Holland Park Avenue and went before the same tribunal on 27 November 1995. The case was Robinglade Ltd 
	<i>v.</i> Tremayne Investments Ltd. and involved a 125-year lease. It had been granted only recently and 117 years—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is entitled to a rather better hearing that he seems to be getting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. McWilliam.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case involved a 125-year lease with 117 years to run. One would have thought that the price that the leaseholders had paid would be very close to the price paid to the landlord—the value—and that there would be no marriage value involved. However, that did not prove to be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was another basis on which one could have valued. The property had been sold on to another freeholder a little more than two years before 1995, placing it before the 1993 Act. The price that the reversionary interest—the freehold—had been sold at was £5,000. Members of the Committee must remember what happened to property values in 1993, 1994 and 1995. We all know how much they failed to increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One would have thought that if the leaseholders were to purchase the freehold—the reversionary interest—they could say, "Thank goodness, we have a price that has been fixed—it is £5,000." This was an open market sale—it was an auction sale—and one would have thought that the price of the freehold would be fixed. However, that was not to be. After the sale at £5,000, an entirely new concept—that of marriage value—was introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What did marriage value do in the two years in which prices went down? It bumped up—doubled—the price. The marriage value was the price plus £5,000 as a proper assessment on the rental. The total value was almost £10,000. The entirely new concept of marriage value had come in. [

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I am called to order, I should make a standing rather than a sedentary intervention. I hasten to disagree with my hon. Friend, though I am sorry to do so. In valuation parlance, the concept of marriage value has existed for at least 50 years, and probably for more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has not been a legal concept. It might have been in parlance or anecdotal, but it was not used in legal terms. It came into being only in 1993 and was an entirely new legal concept. The purchaser of the reversionary interest, who had not realised when he bought it that he was sitting on a gold mine, said, "Whoopee, this is terrific. I can double the value of my property." All that rests on the bogus idea of marriage value.

Amendment No. 595 would change that basis and take it back to what the chap was buying in the first place, for which he paid £5,000. He had a commercial interest in buying and paid £5,000. I make clear in my amendment what those commercial interests should be. I set out the criteria and, if there has been a sale in the past two years, the value is set there and then. That value is based on what someone has paid on the open market and it should include the reasonable costs that may have been incurred by the reversioner plus the interest on that sum for the two years. That is a fair and logical approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not be talking about hypothetical concepts; we should be determining the value of the landlord's interest. If he bought a property two years before, we know what its value is. It is not a hypothetical idea that doubles the value. The case that I described illustrates how bogus marriage values are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 595 would also make provision for sales that have taken place in the previous 10 years, and inflation would be taken into account. The amendment would also make provision for the fact that the value should not reflect any of the interests, such as service interests, that we discussed this morning. They should not be taken into account in determining the value of landlord's interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have described my case. I have a 999-year lease, with 950 years to run at £15 a year. The value can only be £150 per flat. It cannot be any more than that. What marriage value could there conceivably be under any—[

In other words, the two halves are less than the whole. There is greater value in having one interest rather than two different interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is an extraordinary position.

My hon. Friend says that I should know about marriage values, but that is not my area of expertise. [

I have an absolute wealth of common sense about these matters, which—I beg to suggest—is superior to the lack of sense that we see in the surveying profession over the bogus idea of marriage values. The surveying profession has spent most of its time trying to support the great landlords. It is employed by the great landlords and it has no other interest other than retaining concepts such as marriage values.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concept of marriage value defies common sense, although it might have been used for some time among the profession. When made, the purchases were entirely business purchases. They were made in a business-like way for a business-like reason. Therefore, when the landlord is buying the property for business purposes, why is his interest supposed to be different from the situation when the tenants want to acquire the freehold? Why should the conception be different? Someone can buy something for £5,000 one day, yet the next day when the tenant says that he wants to buy the freehold, why should he have to pay £20,000? That makes a mockery of marriage values because the process simply reflects the value to the landlord of the holding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When trying to ascertain the value of my freehold, I have been told by my landlord, "But I am getting 17 per cent. of the insurance premium, the vast and over-inflated insurance premium that you are paying. Surely I am entitled to be compensated for that." My argument is that, according to the Lands Tribunal and the decisions in such cases, he should not be so compensated. But I want that put down in black and white and made into law, because there is a definite uneasiness about decisions in lower tribunals and courts throughout the country. I want the matter covered by statute. That would make everyone understand, including the tenants, what the price should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>958</span>
My amendment covers the position when the lease has less than 50 years to run. The cut-off point should not be higher than 50 years. Most normal people would consider waiting 50 years for the freehold long enough. Having disposed of the freehold once, the fact that there was still 50 years to go would, in most normal minds, be of little value to the reversioner. In any event, I do not see why the reversioner should benefit to the extent that he might.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no bones about my philosophical differences in respect of the rights of landlords; 50 years must be the cut-off point. The value should be no more than 10 times the ground rent. That is the commercial way in which to consider the values rather than the difficult way in which the Lands Tribunal does when it gives a value for the first 17 years, another value for the next 20 years and another for the next 25 years. The process is complicated; it should be simplified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a commercial venture, 10 times the value is sufficient. In the current climate, it would be adequate in deals concerning sales of companies. Seven or eight times the value would be adequate, but 10 times the value is a good figure to consider; it fixes the price and simplifies the concept. Amendment No. 595 also covers peppercorn rents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cost is another aspect that puts people off. So often reasonable offers are made by tenants, but landlords are put off, because they wish to continue collecting commission. Perhaps they will get one more year's painting job or their surveyors will be employed for another year. They keep putting tenants off. A tenant who applies for the freehold will have a big problem because it will cost him money to go before the Lands Tribunal, and he will not know much about the procedure. I believe that when the landlord has behaved unreasonably, the tenant should be able to get costs. When an offer has been made within 10 per cent. of what is finally agreed by the Lands Tribunal, the party that has been unreasonable should be expected to pay the costs. When the figure is within, say, 10 per cent., the parties involved could say "Well, we'll split the difference." If they cannot get their heads together and one person is unreasonable, I do not see why the other party should have to bear the costs. That will act as an incentive to get people to agree. After all, it is far better that they should agree the figure than fight it out in the Lands Tribunal involving people spending their valuable time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an important amendment because there is a philosophical difference. I feel strongly that we should move away from the concept of marriage values. We should consider what is the actual value and the reality, which is that the landlord has bought the property on the basis that he will collect ground rent, providing him with a return of 10, 15 or 20 per cent. on the amount that he paid. That is the basis on which we should proceed and the reason for my new clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that that will not lead the right hon. Gentleman to a re-appraisal of his views about the Opposition's position. I assure him that it was on a very technical point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate is focusing on the issue of marriage value, which is one of the most crucial in the whole concept of leasehold reform. It is problematic, as the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire has rightly highlighted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concept of marriage value was not in the Leasehold Reform Act 1967, which successfully introduced the concept of enfranchisement, resulting in hundreds of thousands of properties being transferred from leasehold to outright freehold tenure. That was effected without any marriage value. Marriage value was imported into the 1993 legislation when the enfranchising process was extended to leaseholders in flats. I should stress that it had not applied to the compulsory purchase powers in the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987, which allowed, in theory, leaseholders to acquire the freeholds of their homes where the freeholder had not been managing the property properly and the leaseholders had secured court agreement to transfer of ownership. I do not believe that a single transfer has taken place. Nevertheless, part III of the 1987 Act had no provision for taking marriage value into account. The concept was imported by the 1993 legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When marriage value was first introduced, I remember the then Minister, the right hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young), bringing a diagram into the Committee to explain it. My hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate was a member of that Committee and will recall the occasion. Such
	<span class='label label-info column'>960</span>
was the complexity of the issue that the Minister did not feel that he could explain it without a huge chart covered in figures and bar graphs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that whoever chaired that Committee was remiss as to allow a diagram to be used. The Standing Order is that if it cannot be described in words it does not happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall re-read 
	<i>Hansard</i> as quickly as possible to refresh my memory. Mrs. Winterton's husband, the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton), presided over that occasion. I recall the visual aids.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were then told that marriage value was, as the hon. Member for Circencester and Tewkesbury has pointed out, the increase in value created by bringing together the separate freehold and leasehold interests. It was assumed that that should be shared between the freeholder and the leaseholder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsequently, as a result of concessions from the Government to the landed interests who had a disproportionate influence during the passage of that Act, the concept of marriage value was changed. In the current legislation, it seems that the freeholder is guaranteed a minimum 50 per cent. and can have up to 100 per cent. of marriage value. There is no question of equity in the current arrangement which has been titled in favour of landowning interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To date, the leasehold valuation tribunal in London, at least, has gone for a rough 50:50 split of marriage value. I am not sure what is the case elsewhere. But it is still of concern that there is a substantial additional cost for leaseholders enfranchising. The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire has pointed out that fear of those costs is particularly worrying for leaseholders who are thinking of enfranchising. I have no doubt that fear of the substantial costs of negotiating marriage value and of the cost of meeting the marriage value requirement has deterred substantial numbers of leaseholders who would otherwise would have enfranchised their homes. That is why we believe that the issue must be revisited. The odds are unfairly stacked in the landlord's favour. The scheme is hugely complicated and intimidating, and the outcome leaves many leaseholders unable to proceed with purchasing the freehold of their homes, despite the intentions behind the 1993 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire has done the Committee a real service in bringing forward detailed proposals in new clauses, detailed amendments and complex schedules that demystify the process. We will support his amendments and new clauses because we believe that marriage value is currently unfair and unjustified. There is a strong case for reform. I hope that we will succeed in persuading the Government to take a more enthusiastic view of the case for reform than they have previously. I fear, however, that we will not. I fear that if we cannot persuade Ministers to support rental deposit schemes, we have precious little chance of getting them to believe in the abolition of marriage value, but we live
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0542">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>961</span>
in hope and will continue to do so because the current framework is unsatisfactory. It is not working, and leaseholders are not securing their rights. Reform is overdue. I hope that the Minister will surprise me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the Committee that I have no diagrams up my sleeve, and I do not intend to be rude about anyone's profession, least of all that of my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire, as that would involve a self-inflicted wound.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened with great interest to the debate, which has ranged widely. It might assist the Committee if I returned to the background and the principles. New clause 49 seeks a method for calculating the price that the leaseholders must pay, which would be simpler than that set out in schedule 6 to the 1993 Act. New clause 50 raises the difficult issue of who pays the costs of the enfranchisement procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me deal first with valuation, I have some sympathy with my hon. Friend's intentions. We all want to make the enfranchisement procedure as simple and straightforward as possible, in order to encourage leaseholders to exercise those important rights. However, we must also ensure that the procedures are fair to all parties involved, and we need to remember—this is an important point for the Committee—that leasehold enfranchisement is essentially a form of compulsory purchase of the freehold interest by the leaseholders. The price paid must therefore represent a fair market value for that interest, which the current valuation method in the Act seeks to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the valuation procedures. There are essentially three elements in the price formula set out in schedule 6 to the 1993 Act. The first is an amount that reflects the open market value of the freehold. The second element is a share of the marriage value, which we have heard about. The marriage value reflects the special value generated by the merging of the leasehold and freehold interests, and is not reflected in the value of freeholds traded on the open market and not involving a purchase by the freeholder. The Act states that the freeholder should receive at least 50 per cent. of the marriage value and, as the Committee has heard, most leasehold valuation tribunals have been sharing the marriage value on a 50:50 basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The marriage value concept was well established prior to the 1993 Act, in relation to leasehold enfranchisement, and the purpose is to share the benefit of enfranchisement on a reasonable basis between leaseholder and freeholder. It represents a genuine benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third element in the price is any additional amount to cover "injurious affection" to the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of this description of the existing formula, I hope that members of the Committee will agree that in the search for simplicity, the alternative methods of valuation contained in the new clause would depart from an essentially fair system. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>962</span>
amendment would not produce a price that was fair to all parties in every case. Although I listened with great interest to the arguments presented by my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire, I cannot accept them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With reference to my hon. Friend's proposals on costs, I am afraid that I must take issue with him on two counts. First, as an important general principle, leaseholders should pay the reasonable costs of the landlord. That is because the enfranchisement rights contained in 1993 Act amount to compulsory acquisition. It is a long-established convention that in such cases the purchaser should pay any costs incurred by the vendor. In fact, however, the Act provides that the elements of the landlord's costs which the leaseholders must pay are quite restricted. Most importantly, they do not have to pay the landlord's costs involved in appearing before a leasehold valuation tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are protections for leaseholders with respect to costs. The leasehold valuation tribunal can be requested to determine the landlord's reasonable costs in respect of enfranchisement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue is the suggestion in the amendment that in cases where there is a dispute that goes to the leasehold valuation tribunal, the tribunal should have the power to award costs, and that where the freeholder is subsequently found to have refused an offer by the tenants that was within 10 per cent. of the adjudicated amount, the award should be against the landlord. That, I believe, would not be desirable. The present safeguards are adequate and the system represents a fair and balanced approach to enfranchisement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
