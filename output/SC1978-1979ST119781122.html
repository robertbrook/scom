	<div class='legislation'>DISTRIBUTION OF FOOTWEAR (PRICES) ORDER 1978</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection (Mr. Robert Maclennan)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Distribution of Footwear (Prices) Order 1978 (S.I. No. 1307).</p></blockquote>
The order gives effect to recommendation by the Price Commission in its report into the prices, costs and margins in the distribution of footwear in the United Kingdom. The report was made pursuant to a direction issued under section 10 (1) of the Price Commission Act 1977 by the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection on 12th September 1977, following widespread public concern at costs and services within the sector, requiring the Commission to examine the prices, costs and margins in the distribution of footwear. The report was published on 9th June 1978.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee may find it helpful if I detail some of the Commission's findings to explain and give a perspective to the order. The Commission found that although the period since 1970 had seen a growth in real terms of 20 per cent, by value, of footwear expenditure, with two-thirds of all sales accounted for by multiple specialists and an increase in the share by variety stores, this growth was misleading. It disguised the power in the market place of one major multiple outlet—the British Shoe Corporation—and its consequences for competitive forces and the gross profit percentage margins enjoyed by retailers as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, gross profit percentage margins in footwear distribution grew rapidly in the period between 1961 and 1971 with only two of 20 defined retail trades in the 1971 census of distribution showing higher gross margins in the latter years. Similarly, although the number of footwear multiples outlets showed a higher growth in numbers of outlets than retail trades generally, there was no increase in their share of the trade and little increase in the average sales
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
per employee. The broad picture was one of low labour productivity and a wide disparity between individual shops in terms of efficiency, with many prepared to tolerate inefficient practices—although that picture should not be allowed to mask the real improvements that had been achieved by some retailers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's conclusion from the examination was that the relatively static share of the market enjoyed by the largest multiple outlet—the British Shoe Corporation—had its impact on the gross margins of footwear distributors as a whole. The absence of a fully competitive market situation had allowed those margins to rise to a higher level than might otherwise have been, with gross profit margins ranging in the three-year period between 1975 and 1977 between 40 and 53 per cent, for the multiple specialists, with average gross profit percentage margins at a relatively high level of 42.8 per cent, for 1977, and an increase in margins of 37 per cent, between 1961 and 1971—higher than that achieved in retailing generally. This average margin for multiple specialist compares with that of 34.6 per cent, achieved in the same year by the independents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission accordingly recommended that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the gross profit percentage margin of each multiple footwear specialist company"—being multiples with 10 or more outlets—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(a) should not in any case be allowed to exceed the gross margin in 1977 and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>where the 1977 gross margin exceeded that achieved in 1975 should not exceed

	<ol>

	<li>the gross margin achieved in 1975 or</li>

	<li>a level of 2 percentage points below the gross margin achieved in 1977</li></ol></p></blockquote>
whichever is the greater, but in all cases subject to the safeguards for basic profits provided for in section 9 of the Price Commission Act 1977. These percentage margins should not be exceeded in any period of six months commencing on or after 1st October 1978. They should be achieved by obviating or restricting increases in retail selling prices, as and when they may otherwise have been justified by cost increases or other relevant considerations or by making price reductions. For this purpose it will be permissible to take into account only 'arms-length' values for cost incurred. When an enterprise has an accounting year that does not correspond with the calendar years 1975 and 1977, the gross margins attributable to these years shall be construed as being the overall level of gross margin achieved in the most recent accounting year of the enterprise ending before 1st July 1976 in respect of 1975 or 1st July 1978 in respect of 1977."</p></blockquote>
Following representations made to him, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
State for Prices and Consumer Protection considered that it would be appropriate for the recommendation to be implemented but with certain very significant exceptions with which I shall deal shoitly. The order gives effect to my right hon. Friend's decision and since the margin control will extend beyond 12 months, it is subject to affirmative rather than negative, resolution of both Houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order specifies in article 2 the persons to whom it applies and implements in article 3 the recommendation of the Commission that I have detailed. Article 4 provides for its enforcement by the Price Commission and the schedule details those to whom the order does not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order, therefore, applies to all footwear distributors, or in case of companies in a group the members of the group taken together, having 10 or more retail outlets other than those specified in the, schedule including their respective subsidiaries. It will be in operation for a period of two years from 1st October 1978 until 30th September 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will understand, however, that perhaps more than most sectors of retailing, the consumer interest in footwear is not solely about prices. The consumer's concern is for the quality of the product, health considerations, a satisfactory complaints procedure and the existence of a strong and efficient domestic manufacturing base.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The representations which my right hon. Friend received during his consideration of the report from manufacturers and retailers and consumer and trade union organisations suggested this to be a widely held view and one which was shared on all sides. My right hon. Friend therefore took the opportunity, in considering the Price Commission's report, to take account of all these wider interests as well as the price considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of multiple footwear retailers, representing a substantial majority of that sector of the trade, expressed a willingness to offer a package of measures of benefit to the consumer and the industry, which would, at the same time, build on existing work and further the Government's wider objectives in a number of areas of public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These offers involved a number of undertakings. First, there was an undertaking to freeze gross profit percentage margins in their 1978 and 1979 accounting
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
years to 1977 levels and assutances on the footwear code of practice, the footwear code monitoring report, "The Retail Commitment" and retail employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be right for me to explain briefly the implications of the various assurances been given by the trade. The voluntary code of practice for footwear was launched in August 1976 with the principal aim of improving the quality of service offered to the public by distributors and retailers. It was intended to provide customers with the proper, necessary information, to encourage staff training and to provide a speedy and efficient complaints procedure. The assurances that the multiple specialists were willing to offer further strengthened their commitment to the code and gave assurance of their intention to establish cooperative schemes to cater for extreme sizes of footwear, the establishment of an industry-funded research programme and the development of educational programmes for those most at risk in respect of footwear, such as children and elderly purchasers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The footwear code monitoring report, which comments on the first two years' operation of the code, identified a number of areas where further attention was required, including pre-testing of new ranges, labelling and classification, and fees for the use of the footwear test centre. The retailers indicated to my right hon. Friend their intention to work towards implementing these recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As part of the Government's industrial strategy objectives, the footwear industry steering group—a body representing manufacturers, distributors and unions in the footwear industry—recommended in April 1977 the forging of closer links between manufacturers, suppliers of materials and distributors and that the implementation of this recommendation should be the responsibility of a newly created footwear industry working party, a body on which, again, the various sectors of the industry are represented. These recommendations are known as "The Retail Commitment". As a result of the discussions which followed the Price Commission report, the multiple retailers confirmed their adherence to the commitment, agreed to the establishment to monitor it, and said that they would consider seriously the extension of its coverage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, discussions with the multiple retailers showed that, as part of a package
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
of measures, they would be willing to go beyond the provisions of the Employment Protection Act in the protection of their employees and embody this in assurances to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirty-nine companies offered such undertakings and assurances, and the Secretary of State accordingly decided to exempt them from the provisions of the order. These companies are detailed in the schedule to the order. Because of the importance which the Government attach to the provisions of the package of undertakings and assurances, by right hon. Friend would be willing to offer exemption from the order to those companies subject to its provisions, but whose consideration leads them to offer such undertakings and assurances as have been given by the scheduled companies. The Secretary of State would therefore propose to give effect to any such further undertakings by way of amendment to the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Committee will agree that the standards of British footwear and of retailing are generally good and that our industry has a high reputation. But there is no room for any complacency. The multiple retailers have recognised that and their constructive response to my right hon. Friend's consideration of the Price Commission's report has further strengthened efforts already underway to secure improvements across the whole sector. The acceptance of those undertakings and assurances by my right hon. Friend has been widely welcomed by both sides of the industry and I think that they give the opportunity of long-term benefit to the consumer. I therefore recommend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.44 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Neubert</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that the terms of the order are welcomed by the shoe retailing industry since it represents the outcome of discussions between the footwear industry working party and the Secretary of State in the summer, following the publication of the Price Commission's report. That may be so, but I would say to the industry, in the friendliest possible spirit, that he who sups with the Devil must use a long spoon. But on the assumption that it has a long spoon, I wish to comment on some other
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
features of the order, in particular the fact that it exempts 39 multiple specialist retailers, who we are told, are a great majority of such retailers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are therefore considering an order which relates to the minority, and I should like to know how many retailers are involved, and why they refused to make the commitments that would have exempted them from the order. It seems desirable that if undertakings are to be sought and if multiple retailers are to be exempted from the Secretary of State's proposals, it would be better if they all agreed. We would not have had to meet here this morning and add yet another Statutory instrument to the many thousands already in operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chairman of the footwear industry working party apparently believes that the presentation of a concerted view to the Secretary of State on the Price Commission report had a beneficial outcome. He believes that the right hon. Gentleman's decision which sprang from that will not only provide a better service for the public, but avoid another big upsurge in shoe imports. I shall come to those points later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth remembering that if this were a Bill rather than an order, the different treatment of organisations in the same industry would make the matter hybrid and subject to representations to this House. I believe the Price Commission Act in section 12 (6) (
	<i>b</i>) contains the necessary authority so that the hybrid procedure is not appropriate in this case, but I should welcome confirmation of my understanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Price Commission report gives an indication on only one issue—that of price—and the order represents its precise recommendation on the control of gross profit margins. The Commission concluded from its examination—which, incidentally, had to be extended in time, so presumably the Commission was pressed to complete the necessary investigations in the time allowed—that gross profit percentage margins in the industry were generally too high. The Under-Secretary has mentioned that in 1977 they were as high as 42.8 per cent, and, in some cases went as high as 53 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can well imagine that the Price Commission, faced day by day with the generally low level of profitability in British industry, was shocked to find an industry enjoying such apparently healthy profits. Retailing is generally more profit-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0180">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
able than manufacturing, but I do not think that profitability is notoriously one of our worst problems in this country, certainly not in the last few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report went on to examine what grounds existed to justify such a high level of profitability and it lit on two—the slow stock turn and the wide range of choice provided. As somebody who has the misfortune to have size 12 feet I would be the last to approve anything that did away with a wide range of choice in shoe shops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was delighted that the Under-Secretary of State mentioned extreme sizes in the context of the voluntary code of practice, because it is a real difficulty for people in my position to get any choice of shoes or to get any shoes at all without having them hand made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report said that there was a wide disparity of efficiency within the retailing industry and low labour productivity. On those grounds it was recommended to the Secretary of state that there should be some control of the profit margins.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note that there was scant reference—in fact, on my examination, none—to the questions of investment and employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Price Commission, as its name indicates, is primarily concerned with price. Price is the trigger which allows it to activate its inquiries and, although it has a general remit on competition, price is undoubtedly the most important element of its work. But here we have undertakings which relate not just to price, but to many other matters affecting the industry. Again, I should like confirmation of where this authority lies. Presumably it is section 12(3)(
	<i>a</i>), because it was anticipated when the Bill was passing through the House that undertakings would be mainly on the question of price. To be faced with these undertakings over a much wider area puts a new complexion on the workings of the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One needs to be assured that all these undertakings are consistent with competition and efficiency in industry, which is the Price Commission's prime purpose. The Minister has mentioned that there are consumer considerations other than price—the quality of the product, health, complaints procedure and a strong domestic manufacturing base—and he has outlined in detail the undertakings given by the industry in return for exemptions from the order. I do not quarrel with the general
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
undertakings that the industry has given to adhere to the voluntary commitments already entered into in the voluntary code of practice of August 1976 and "The Retail Commitment" of April last year, but I ask the Minister to indicate what he meant by his cursory reference to the undertaking on employment. He said that the industry had undertaken to go beyond the Employment Protection Act in relation to its employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a genuine matter of interest to consumers, because I—and perhaps the consumers would too if they were aware of it—find it a little difficult to reconcile such a provision with the ground cited for the order being made in the first place, namely low labour productivity. How will it be possible to reconcile going beyond the provisions of current legislation and, at the same time, achieving better productivity in the industry? It may be possible in the longer term, but I believe that it would be helpful to the Committee if the Minister were to outline in greater detail what is at issue in this respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.52 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Rodgers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just a few words for my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary. I am curious that the control should relate largely to the year of 1977 and, to a degree, to 1975. These certainly appear to have been vintage years for profits. The profit margins appear to have been sensationally high. I reflect upon the campaign, in which I have been involved, on imports for the shoe trade. It strikes me that people are inclined to purchase imported goods simply because they are cheaper. Obviously, there is a great scope for the reduction of prices which would deal, at least to some extent, with the problems of imports affecting employment in our shoe industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry is of course—as are most retail outlets—an area of low wages. Certainly, people are not paid excessively in retail distribution and, when one compares that fact with the profit margins over these years, one cannot help but feel offended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that the instrument runs for less than two years from now, and it seems to be a great upheaval when the whole thing will collapse in any case in October 1980. The list of exemptions certainly covers the vast majority of retailers. If we recognise that before a company can be affected it must have 10 outlets and consider the vast
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0181">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
list of exemptions, we must realise that there cannot be many left. I fail to understand why, if those companies have been exempted from the order because they have reached certain commitments and an understanding with the Department, that understanding was not also extended to the price controls and to the reduction in profit margins. Why could companies not accept those aspects as part of the agreement?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agreement which has apparently been reached, or is in the process of being reached, involves manufacturing areas as well as retailing and indicates that there is room for a planning agreement. Has that matter been pursued, and is there any prospect of a planning agreement that will involve the manufacturing side particularly, though obviously the retail side as well? I think that all the items dealt with in the order could have been incorporated in a planning agreement which would have had more useful elements than are contained in the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.55 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Max Madden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no wish to detain the Committee, but I should like to make some brief comments, and to ask my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State whether he can give us some further information about the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is well known that the footwear industry has been undergoing very severe problems over recent years and that it has been characterised by excessive profits, concentration of manufacturing and retail ownership and increasing imports. Therefore, I associate myself with the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Rodgers), which I believe to be particularly pertinent, and I hope that the Under-Secretary can give us some further information on the matters that my hon. Friend raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also worth noting that we are concerned with consumer affairs relating to shoes and to price control, and that there is only a single Conservative Member attending the Committee—the hon. Member for Romford (Mr. Neubert). I am not altogether certain whether he is here because of his Front Bench responsibilities or because he has big feet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I assure the hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Madden), that it is regarded on the Opporsition side that,
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
one Conservative is worth half dozen Socialists. Therefore, I do not need to have my colleagues here in greater numbers to make the case. Just for the record, however, these issues have been the subject of representations from my hon. Friends, as the Minister will be able to confirm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Madden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Member for Romford will be able to further his career by his conscientious diligence this morning. I did not wish to pursue the matter, but I was interrupted a number of times. I was making the general point, which all Members will confirm, that the Conservative Party has, time and again, either opposed or failed to support any efforts by the Government to try to reduce or lessen the impact of prices upon the consumer. That, is on the record for all to see and has been the case over the last four and a half years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Romford has asked the Under-Secretary whether he could give some further information about the extent of the number of firms who are the subject of the order. It would also be extremely useful if my hon. Friend could give us an indication of the market share of the firms who are exempted from the order and their number of employees and tell us more about the direct benefit derived from the order by the consumer

	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
so far and the benefits which consumers may expect while the order is in force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard something of the impact of imports upon the British shoe industry, and anyone who has been involved in these matters is fully aware that the competition from imports has not been wholly concerned with price. It has been concerned much more with quality and design. Indeed, in many cases imported shoes are considerably more expensive than British-made shoes. Therefore, I should appreciate some further comments from the Under-Secretary about the efforts being made to improve the design and quality of British shoes. I should certainly like considerably more information about what is being done, following the discussions to which he referred, to try to increase the efficiency of the British shoe industry and to guard against monopoly ownership, both in manufacturing and in retailing, which is a very dangerous feature of the British industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I join my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Rodgers) in pressing the merits of a planning agreement approach, because this is an extremely compact industry which lends itself ideally to a planning agreement approach. Indeed, the working party, which has been mentioned, forms the basis of that sort of tripartite planning agreement approach between management, unions and Government. I shall welcome further details about what plans exist for building on that foundation, which seems to have produced some progress over recent months. We shall also appreciate further information from the Under-Secretary about his Department's plans for ensuring that the industry does not go back to some of the very worrying activities that we have seen in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is imperative that we consolidate on the progress which has been made and ensure that there is the greatest intervention by his Department and others in the affairs of the footwear industry, at both manufacturing and retail level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. John Dunlop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to say a few things very briefly. First, my attandence here necessitated my getting out of bed at five o'clock this morning in order to catch the first flight from Belfast. I consider that when I get a card to attend a Committee in the House I should attend. Many of us from Northern Ireland have indicated our desire to take a meaningful part in this and
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
later Parliaments. That is why I am here. Needless to say, my wife drove me to the airport, and the conversation between home and the airport was very restricted and the journey was carried out in total darkness. However, here I am.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that one Northern Ireland firm is mentioned in the list of exemptions-Eastwoods Shoe Bargains. In view of the colossal sales that the firm sometimes holds and the huge bargains advertised and seen in its windows, one wonders what was its original profit margin. Through the grapevine we understand that when it holds its sales, the firm is still not losing anything but that a small profit results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Prices in Northern Ireland are generally higher for practically everything. The people there are under pressure because we pay more for the basic amenities of life. We pay astronomic prices for electricity, gas and coal, and for food as well. Thus we have not much money left for shoes and we look for bargains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has, of course, been a limited loss of jobs in Northern Ireland because of the closing down of manufacturing complexes over the past few years. This is due, I believe, largely to the pressure of imports, which makes it impossible for them to make the shoes and give reasonable wages in Northern Ireland. Incidentally, on the point of wages, we are all aware that average manufacturing wages in Northern Ireland are roughly only 75 per cent, of those on the mainland. This is a further disadvantage of living in that delectable little land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The loss of jobs due to imports concerns another Government Department, and does not strictly relate to the order, but I wanted to make a few remarks, to show what difficulties are being undergone in Northern Ireland. I could have been here last night to make things easier for myself, but I was visiting the areas which have suffered savage bombing in the past few days and trying to offer sympathy and help to traders and residents who have suffered greatly because 6f the latest IRA attack upon our people in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As 30-odd per cent, of my constituents are employed in the footwear industry, the order is of great interest to me. We have heard some amazing revelations this morning. I am sure that we all commend the hon. Member for Mid-

Ulster (Mr. Dunlop) for leaving Ireland at such an early hour in order to attend this Committee. I, too, left fairly early, but I could not compete with the hon. Gentleman on that score.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also heard an amazing story from the hon. Member for Romford (Mr. Neubert) who, despite his 12 league boots, took two and a half hours to make a 25 minute journey. Should he require any further pairs of 12 league boots, I hope that he will come to Rossendale, where we will try to fit him up with British footwear—although I trust that the hon. Gentleman buys British footwear in any case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made an extraordinary observation when asking about the effect of the order on competition within the retail industry. The problem of the manufacturers is the lack of competition in the retailing industry, particularly among multiple stores. The fact that the industry is dominated by the British Shoe Corporation has been a cause of grave distress among footwear manufacturers for many years. Many would go so far as to say that the British Shoe Corporation is more interested in the property values of its shops in the High Street than in the service it gives to its consumers. To encourage the British Shoe Corporation to come into "The Retail Commitment" has been a major step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friends on the need for a planning agreement. In fact, it is significant that the authors of the footwear study—a tripartite study composed of manufacturers, trade unions and Members of Parliament on both sides of the House—were unanimous in their recommendation that there should be a planning agreement for the industry. Unfortunately, when the Department of Industry produced the scheme for the footwear industry, that part of the report was omitted. Nevertheless, "The Retail Commitment" is to be welcomed, and the way in which the order is drawn up to take allowance for it is very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But "The Retail Commitment" has two very significant things to say about the manufacturing side of the industry. First, the retailers say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We will give the manufacturers support on imported goods where subsidies by other Governments or tariff controls make it unfair to established manufacturers in this country."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
In other words, they will support the manufacturers against the problems of dumping.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At a later point in "The Retail Commitment" there is an even more important statement. Companies within the retail trade will make it clear to their buyers:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the development of home factories through face-to-face co-operation is one of their prime responsibilities."</p></blockquote>
In the past, it has been lack of cooperation which, in some ways, has led to a decline in the manufacturing sector and the rise of import levels. Anything which brings manufacturers and retailers together will be of great benefit to those who are employed in the manufacturing side of the industry. My hon. Friends mentioned profits. I am sure we share a common view about profits, but one of the problems of large sectors of the industry has been that whereas profits have been high in retailing they have been persistently low on the manufacturing side and this has led to low growth, higher prices and, therefore, the problem of imports. One of the problems facing the manufacturing side has been the tremendous pressure exerted by the major retailers, such as the British Shoe Corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we talk about the benefit of the order to consumers we should remember that the consumer on Saturday is the producer midweek. People in my constituency who are working in the footwear factories today will go out on Saturday to buy their shoes. If the jobs are not there because we cannot restrain imports the shoes they buy will not be British. It is therefore extremely important that we develop further the ideas in "The Retail Commitment" and persuade the industry—the manufacturers, the retailers and the trade unions—through the study group and "The Retail Commitment", to take this as far as they can in order to develop the home manufacturing side. I am sure that the hon. Member for Romford (Mr. Neubert) will agree that if one is trying to buy size 12 shoes, one is better buying British.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I rarely disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Sowerby (Mr. Madden), but I must say that although there may be competition on style, design and quality, the real threat to the British footwear industry, in manufacturing terms in recent years, has been from places such as South Korea, Taiwan and other countries in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0184">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
Far East, from South America—countries such as Brazil—and from Eastern Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The competition there has been essentially on low cost footwear, and it is from those areas that we have shoes dumped. It is difficult to chase up what is happening in the domestic markets so one cannot tell whether there is unfair trading or not. That is the area in which we need a commitment from retailers that they will buy British.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the manufacturers in my constituency who are still a little reluctant about "The Retail Commitment" will see, through the order, that it is well worth supporting and will enter into it just as many as the retailers have done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacLennan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by expressing my gratitude and appreciation to everyone who has participated in what has turned out to be a useful and important debate. The debate has demonstrated that the problems of the footwear industry, consumers and producers are manifold and that the Government's decision not to concentrate solely on the price recommendations of the Price Commission report can be justified by some of the difficulties faced by the industry, and referred to by the hon. Member for Mid-Ulster (Mr. Dunlop) in relation to Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is competition from imports and low profitability in the manufacturing sector, about which my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale (Mr. Noble) spoke, and it was desirable to recognise some of those factors in arriving at an appropriate response to what the Commission had advanced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal with a number of matters that were raised, but let me refer first to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Craigen). The Price Commission has a continuing role of scrutiny of the trade and of the manufacturing sector and it is open to the Commission to focus particularly upon any company that applies for or proposes a price increase. I have no doubt that the remarks of my hon. Friend and others who feel concerned about a particular industry or sector of the industry
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
will be borne in mind by the Price Commission and by my right hon. Friend in deciding what further sectoral references ought to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Romford (Mr. Neubert) asked about coverage of the order, its effectiveness, how many companies were likely to be bound by its provisions and which firms were excluded—a question reiterated by a number of my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Broadly, the retail trade consists of a number of different sectors, but the multiple shoe distributors, with which the order is primarily concerned, constitute about 44 per cent, of the distribution of shoes, and it is true, that of that 44 per cent., the overwhelming number are included in the schedule. There are one or two companies, that have come to light as having been unaware of what was going on, which may wish to offer assurances that would lead my right hon. Friend to seek to cover them by the exemptions. One company has indicated that it does not wish to give those assurances and is prepared to accept the consequences of the restraint of gross profit margins which the order provides for. But it is broadly true to say that the overwhelming number of companies of which we are aware have offered the assurances and, indeed, the statutory undertakings which I have described this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ought to draw the Committee's attention to the distinction between the statutory undertakings over which my right hon. Friend has powers of enforcement through the notification of the Price Commission that they may have been breached, which are in a sense not voluntary, and which relate to the control of gross profit margins contained in the order, and the assurances which relate to the other matters—quality, the adherence to the retail commitment and the firm intention to abide by, and indeed develop, the work of the working group—which do not carry statutory force and for which we are obliged to accept that the good faith of the companies which have given these assurances is involved and that it is their firm intention to carry out the assurances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it does not flow from the order that the assurances will be implemented, but we have no reason to believe that they were not given in good faith. It must be recognised that it would be open to the Price Commission to re-open the question, or, indeed, to my right hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0185">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
Friend to re-refer the issue to the Price Commission, if there were any evidence that these assurances were not being lived up to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his opening remarks, the hon. Member for Romford asked whether there was a question of hybridity here. I am advised that there, is not and, as he said, the Bill specifically permits the Secretary of State to do what would otherwise give rise to a question of hybridity. The hon. Gentleman also referred to what he regarded as the scant attention given by the Price Commission to questions of investment and employment. I believe that it is fair-to say that all these matters undoubtedly require consideration by the Price Commission under the criteria set out in section 2 of the Price Commission Act and that it is appropriate for the Commission in issuing its reports to highlight the considerations to which it attaches the greatest importance. But in his response to the Price Commission's report my right hon. Friend has as must be clear from what I have said—attached importance to the representations about the somewhat difficult conditions faced by the industry, particularly in the manufacturing sector, and the possible consequences that would flow for that sector from the full implementation of the Price Commission's recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Romford raised the question of the Secretary of State's authority to accept undertakings and assurances. I hope that with the distinction I have drawn between the undertaking, the authority for the acceptance of which is clear from the Act, and the assurances, for which there is no statutory authority, I have dealt adequately with his point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked also what I meant when I spoke of the assurances given by the industry in respect of employment which went beyond the provisions of the Employment Protection Act. Specifically, one of the things which has been agreed is that in the event of a threatened redundancy, where the Employment Protection Act requires consultation with the unions affected if there are more than 10 people involved, consultations will take place if there are only five people likely to be affected. The assurances go somewhat wider than that, but that is illustrative of the point I was making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Rodgers) spoke of the fact that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
years referred to were bumper years for the trade. He was right, and that is what gave rise to the recommendations of the Price Commission. Indeed, my right hon. Friend in deciding the extent to which he was prepared to give effect to the recommendations of the Price Commission in regard to controlling gross profit margins, had to have, and was statutorily required to have, attention paid to the years recommended by the Price Commission. It is not open to him to depart from those recommendations and to introduce more burdensome controls that are now proposed. But the reasons for his having limited the undertakings on gross profit margins to those that I have described flow from other considerations, particularly those affecting the manufacturing industry, and also the substantial undertakings and assurances that have been given in respect of the consumer interest generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More than one of my hon. Friends asked whether it would not have been a better response to the Price Commission's report to seek a planning agreement with the industry. I am sure that they will know that the difficulties of obtaining planning agreements are real. But in this case, although in principle there may be a great deal to be said for what they urge—I have a good deal of sympathy with what they have said about the desirability of obtaining a planning agreement for the industry—the practical difficulty that lays in our way is that we have a requirement to give effect to the Price Commission's finding within a statutorily prescribed period of three months. Therefore, to bring in all the companies affected, as we have tried to do in this order, within the framework of a planning agreement would simply not have been feasible within that statutorily limited time scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Sowerby (Mr. Madden) spoke both of the excessive profits and the excessive imports of the industry, but in a sense these two facets of the problem of the shoe industry do not exactly square with each other. But they are both problems and are not susceptible to treatment within the limited powers that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State enjoys. It is not wise to seek to build too much upon what can be done by way of extraction of assurances relating to the trade in response to a recommendation which is limited to profit margins.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this case, it has been widely acknow-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0186">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
ledged that my right hon. Friend has gone a long way beyond what has been done in respect of other Price Commission reports in order to achieve desirable objectives other than price objectives. This has been a creative use of the opportunity which my right hon. Friend was given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Sowerby (Mr. Madden) properly asked what consolidation of progress had been made and expressed the hope that there would be continuing work. I share that hope. It is for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Industry and those in the working group to make sure that the provisions of "The Retail Commitment", which my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale (Mr. Noble) spelt out in some detail, are followed up and built upon. I can assure my hon. Friend and other
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
hon. Members who are clearly interested in this trade that my right hon. Friend will keep his eagle eye on the affairs of the industry, because there is no doubt that the shoe industry—particularly the retail trade—has given rise to more consumer complaints over a longer period of time than almost any other section of the retailing trade, and this cannot be regarded as the end of the affair. I am very grateful to my hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Romford for participating in this useful debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
