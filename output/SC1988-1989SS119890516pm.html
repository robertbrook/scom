	<i>Amendment proposed [this day]:</i> No. 316, in page 44, line 25, at beginning insert "—(1)".—
	<i>[Mr. Michael Forsyth.]</i></p>

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this, we are taking Government amendment No. 317.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We started before lunch to discuss the two Government amendments to clause 65. They would allow certain children and young persons with special educational needs to attend establishments outwith the United Kingdom. We support the amendments because they cover an area of enormous complexity and sensitivity, which is clearly characterised by much understandable emotion in respect of profoundly handicapped children. We agree with the Government's initiative to seek to provide the best support for families and children in difficult circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we were slightly disappointed that the Minister did not widen the debate this morning, while keeping within the spirit of the amendment. We should have liked him to discuss in more detail some of the issues that were outlined at the Conservative party conference and which were quoted widely in the national newspapers. I anticipate that those comments will understandably build up people's expectations. Even though it has been only two or three days since the announcement was made, I have received an inquiry from a parent in my constituency about the amendment and the type of provision that might ensue as a result. I suggested that my constituent should contact the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our anxieties go much wider in respect of fulfilling the obligations of amendment No. 317. My hon. Friends have much more experience of health aspects and the provision of special needs than I have. I wish to outline some of our anxieties. Hopefully, the Minister will expand later in our debate on his comments at his party conference, and explain how
	<span class='label label-info column'>1416</span>
he intends to implement the commitment contained in amendment No. 317.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one doubts that children, especially those with cerebral palsy, require the best treatment that we can provide. Over the past two or three years, there has been significant interest in the work done by the Peto institute in Hungary. Indeed, the Minister visited the institute recently. It is important that there is significant investment in Scotland for the long term, so that we can create new forms of care and treatment, and also reinforce some of the best practices in the world that are carried out by institutions in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, we wish the Government to elaborate on their commitment to the provisions for forward investment in Scotland. Naturally, we should be delighted to hear more about the press suggestion that a multi-million pound investment will take place in Hungary. However, our second worry concerns the specific activities of Scottish institutions and education authorities, and what provision the Government will be making to ensure that there is a massive extension of support in Scotland to deal with profoundly handicapped children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our third worry is the process of consultation with the education authorities and, for example, the Spastics Society. It is clear from professionals and parents that although it is useful in the interim to provide more places for children to go to Hungary— we support that—in the longer term there will be a significant number of Scottish children who will not be able to go to Hungary and who look to institutions in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom for a specialised form of treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth concern is that the Government should provide an outline of the evaluation by the Scottish Education Department, with specialist help, of the treatment provided by the Hungarian institute. Some of my hon. Friends have more specialised knowledge of that than I. Expectations will have been raised by the announcement, but we should now be able to obtain from the Government more specific ideas about how the programme will develop. Beyond the 1990s and towards the year 2000 Scottish parents with severely handicapped children will expect Government, no matter what their political persuasion, to provide the best facilities in Scotland and to learn from what is happening worldwide. If possible we should provide facilities in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom that will not only capture the interest of parents concerned about their children but will offer first-class treatment and medical, educational and social support. I hope that the Minister will tell the Committee more about what the Government envisage for the longer term.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to amendment No. 317, but what I shall say is essentially technical. I do not intend to detract from the value of the amendment or from the Minister's genuine interest in the physically handicapped. I wish to raise issues about which not only the Committee but people outwith the Committee, especially parents and education authorities, will want to know more details. I hope that the Minister will respond positively, in the same spirit in which I ask my
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0799">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1417</span>
questions. He may not be able to answer them all today but I hope that between now and Report stage we shall receive additional guidance on the implications of the measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, how are councils to decide which children and parents they will support should applications to attend the Peto institute be made? Will there be a role for education authorities? I note with interest that the proposed new section 65G(2) of the 1980 Act says that the provisions may apply to children who do not have a record of needs. It is understandable that parents will ask for that option but if they do, will they not need professional guidance on whether it constitutes the best method of helping their youngster? People are always vulnerable to making the wrong choice. We are talking about parents facing up to the reality of having a severely handicapped child. The worst possible thing for them would be for the wrong choice to be made about how that child could best be assisted. The clause will require additional guidance for parents. If parents read an article about reflexology and apply to the council will they be given a ticket to go?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the amendment paper is new clause 9, also in my name, which will alter local authorities' duty on the opening of a record of needs for children. It will extend that duty to cover children from the age of two, as opposed to the present age of five. That was done partly in response to the representations that we heard while we were at the Peto institute stressing the importance of identifying children at an early age. We shall discuss that matter further under the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I must admit that I found it difficult to understand the exact implications of new clause 9, although I have read it several times. Following that guidance from the Minister I shall consider it in even more detail when we come to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was talking about recorded needs. We must remember that children under five occasionally have needs recorded. The "Interim Report on the Recording of Special Needs", published in November 1988 by the department of education at Edinburgh university, shows, on page 10, that 85 children under five in Scotland were recorded as having special needs, plus another 277 who were known to have such needs without an effective record of needs having been established.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to mislead the hon. Lady. Local authorities now have the discretion to record the needs of children under five. New clause 9 will require them to do so for children over the age of two so that all children from that age with special needs will come within the net of the local authority's duty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That reply is helpful. As we know that 362 children have already been identified in one year, perhaps the Minister will have to consider not only the provisions in legislation but the question of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1418</span>
adequate staffing and resourcing to build up the records of needs in the most effective fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A substantial number of children are involved. In moving the amendment the Minister implied that only a small number of children would be affected. I know that parents of children between two and five with special needs will seek a place at the Peto institute, but if even 10 per cent, of such parents asked for funding a substantial sum would be committed. I am glad that the Minister said this morning that where necessary he would consider the possibility of making more funds available to local authorities. Has any assessment been made of the sum that will be required and the number of children who will be involved?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An article on the Peto institute in 
	<i>The Times Educational Supplement</i> of 15 January 1988 said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The foundation is inundated with inquiries and the Peto Institute gets around 15 letters a day from Britons alone."</p></blockquote>
That is a lot of letters. Even if only 10 per cent, of those letters came from Scotland that could represent more than 300 children a year. We have to deal with the issue of numbers and money. I know that the Minister says that this is not an argument about finance, but we need guidance on that aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question is whether the education authorities will be offered advice about the institute. I return to the question whether parents with a severely handicapped child can read a magazine article and suddenly decide that that is the way forward for their child. In such a case the authority would have a responsibility to offer guidance on whether an institution would be suitable. Will the Scottish Education Department or Her Majesty's inspectors draft a circular giving guidance on the availability and suitability of the treatment in institutions abroad? Will they ensure that all the organisations are reputable?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the Institute for the Maximisation of Human Potential in Philadelphia. Authoritative research has been done on that place. The book, "The Neurologically Impaired Child— Doman-Delacato Techniques Reappraised", by Robert A. Cummins, was published last year. This is the first authoritative research to be carried out on that method. Mr. Cummins concludes that it is
	<br><blockquote><p>"magical thinking … a programme based on scientific illusions."</p></blockquote>
The book contains 45 pages of references and the major conclusion is that the Doman-Delacato techniques are not based on scientifically validated principles, are inordinately demanding and have no specific efficacy in mediating the disorder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wish to ensure that if parents decide to take their children abroad to receive treatment or assistance, it will be effective I am worried that there has been no authoritative research into the Peto institute. There has been no hard-nosed fundamental research to compare with a peer group elsewhere whether the institute's achievements are significantly greater than elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the Philadelphia institute the patterning programme lasts for 12 to 14 hours daily. There is a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0800">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1419</span>
small amount of improvement intially, but what happens when the parents and the children return home? Attendance at the institute lasts for only weeks and the parents then return home and try to recruit 14, 15 or even more helpers to assist in the very rigorous pattern of training. Will those parents receive support when they return from such institutes to ensure that back-up facilities are available in the local community? The problem is not simply of finding friends or family to participate. There may be a requirement for financial resources. We have a responsibility to ensure that any benefit achieved by those foreign visits continues when people return home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third and perhaps most significant point concerns what happens if a child is rejected and the local council has funded a visit to the Peto institute. That is not the end of the matter because, as the Minister knows, such institutes have their own selection tests and assessment forms. Parents may go to Hungary and immediately be rejected by the institute. That would leave them with a sense of despair. Some children who attend the Peto institute leave it long before expected because it is decided that they are not achieving orthofunction. I believe that 30 per cent, of Hungarian children who attend the Peto institute are rejected within a year. The Minister is shaking his head. I gleaned that information from reading a substantial amount of documentation, but I shall not dispute the figure. However, some youngsters do not complete the course because it is decided that they will not achieve orthofunction. The sadness for those Hungarian children is that no other provision is available at that stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents of children who are rejected initially or at an early stage of treatment return to this country with a sense of failure and despair. They may have pinned all their hopes on the facility remedying their children's problem and when they return, they may feel that there is nothing locally to assist them. With the Minister's commitment to the physically handicapped and especially the pre-school age group, we should consider how to build up facilities in the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is incorrect to say that the Peto institute rejects 30 per cent, of children. Once children are admitted to the institute, they follow the programme and specific targets are set. When I was there, I was struck by the similar story told by all the parents that I met—that they had been told here that nothing could be done for their children, but all were making considerable progress. That is only anecdotal evidence of success in specific cases, but it is wrong to suggest that 30 per cent, are rejected within a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not had the privilege that the Minister has had to visiting the Peto institute. If he invites me on his next trip there, I shall happily go along and discuss the issues with him. The figures that I quoted came from "Conductive Education: a system for overcoming motor disorder" by Philippa Cottam and Andrew Sutton. That text is available for discussion and further study, and I hope that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1420</span>
Minister will take the opportunity to reading some of the articles on conductive education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is initial or subsequent rejection, we should consider fully the problems of parents in ensuring that their children receive adequate physiotherapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy and the whole programme that is necessary for those handicapped children. Youngsters from my constituency have attended the Peto institute, and I know how happy their parents are about that. But I have received many letters from parents who have chosen not to take up the Peto option and who are deeply worried about the lack of facilities for their children here. A cerebral palsied child may have only three hours of physiotherapy a week, which is totally inadequate. We must consider the resources that are provided in Scotland. That is especially important for those who do not choose the option of going abroad and those who return from abroad and need assistance if things have gone wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will consider those matters. I recognise the importance of his amendment and the great commitment of all parents of handicapped children in trying to find the best route for their youngsters. But there are some issues that must be considered and I hope that the Minister responds positively to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing), who has great experience of this area of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What my hon. Friend the Minister has done, especially his visit to the Peto institute in Hungary and his comments since his return, has given heart and encouragement to many Scottish parents. I say that from first-hand experience. Two families in my constituency, both of which I know personally, have children who have attended the Peto institute. As my hon. Friend knows, one of those families was in Hungary when he visited the institute and spoke to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a layman, I have been immensely impressed with what the institute has achieved with those children and families who have attended it. That may be anecdotal, because I have no professional or other qualifications in that area. But in the eyes of their families and from what I have seen, the progress made by those children has been remarkable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee must realise that those achievements have involved immense personal and financial sacrifice by those concerned. Both the cases that I know of were made possible not only because of the personal sacrifice of the families, but through a huge community effort to raise money to help to finance those children's attendance at the institute. The burden is not only financial, but in some cases involves a mother having to give up work to attend with the child, because the treatment involves the whole family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to put on the record my belief that the initiative of my hon. Friend is genuine, worthwhile and certainly greatly appreciated by those concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray was correct to refer to the support that children need when they return
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0801">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1421</span>
from the institute. That is especially so in rural areas. Parents can do a certain amount, but a lot of professional support is necessary, as the hon. Lady said—for example, physiotherapy. That is not always readily available, especially in schools in rural areas. At present I am negotiating with my regional authority concerning a child for whom there is difficulty in maintaining the intensity of the treatment now that the child has returned to the environment of his own school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely support what my hon. Friend the Minister is doing. It is appreciated and worthwhile, but we must also consider the wider dimension and ensure that those who have attended institutes abroad are given the necessary support by their local authorities in their local schools once they return home. The families have made a tremendous commitment and must receive adequate support, especially in a professional sense, so that the treatment can continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, warmly welcome the Government amendment. The Minister looks surprised—so, too, did two of my constituents who came to see me on Friday in connection with the announcement that the Minister made at the Tory party conference. I told them that I have nothing good to say about the Minister, except that he has a positive record in respect of support for parents who seek to send their children to the Peto institute. I shall support the amendment because of my personal experience with three groups of parents in the Dundee area, who have sent their children to the institute and who are all convinced of its track record and of the benefits that have accrued to their children from attendance there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the expertise demonstrated by the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) in her contribution. It behoves the Minister and all of us to pay special attention to what the hon. Lady says, because of her special expertise. She was right to say that, although the parents who come to see us as individual Members of Parliament are anxious for their children to get to the Peto institute and have every right to want that, there may be other parents and children for whom that institute is not suitable. All parents must be given the information necessary for them to make an informed decision about whether it is right for their child to go to Hungary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) that the long-term aim must be to encourage the establishment of a Peto-type institute in Scotland, so that children do not have to travel to other parts of Europe for treatment. I know that there is such an institute in Birmingham but, as I understand it, that institute takes children only from the immediate area, so Scottish children could not go there. Perhaps the Minister will clarify that. In the long term we need an institute of our own in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will take time, so it is important that in the intervening period parents will have the funding to allow them to send their children to Hungary. The matter of cost is essential. The Minister said this
	<span class='label label-info column'>1422</span>
morning that the cost of sending a child to the Peto institute was about £11,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Twelve thousand pounds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Twelve thousand pounds. The Minister said that that compared favourably with the cost of keeping a child in a home or boarding school. The problem is that the parents who have approached me have children of two, three or four years old, who are not in an institution. There is, therefore, no cost to the local authority for those children. If £12,000 is to be made available to those families to allow them to send their children to Hungary, that will be an additional cost to the local authority, which is not spending that money on the children at present, and will have to find it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to see that the Minister proposes in new clause 9 that a record of special needs should be kept for children of two, three and four years old, and not only for children aged five or more. That will also involve additional costs for local authorities. The Minister said that money should not be a problem and that, if it were, he would take action to ensure that it did not remain a problem. I hope that he will honour that commitment and that local authorities will not have difficulty in finding the money to fund parents to send their children to those institutes. Additional money should be made available, and I hope that the Minister will say that that will happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two of the parents whom I saw on Friday said that they estimated the cost to be £1,500 for a two-week stay in Hungary. The recommendation was that the child would perhaps go to Hungary twice a year for many years. Using the Minister's figure of £12,000, perhaps he sees the course lasting four years. I am not expert enough to say how long it should last, but the parents to whom I spoke said that it would cost £3,000 a year for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the education authority must pick up that burden, we must be assured that the money will be available for it to do so. I am pleased that the Minister has tabled the amendment, but I look forward to clarification about whether funding will be made available to enable local authorities to provide the money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Contrary to what my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) seemed to infer, I have absolutely no expertise in this matter. I have no knowledge of such treatment and do not know what conductive education is. I have asked several people but they have not been able to explain it either. I searched through the Index Medicus for references to it, but there were none. That does not mean to say that there are no writings on the subject. Index Medicus contains a list of only selected journals that would not include East European ones, so I have absolutely no knowledge of conductive education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, it has good therapeutic value, or the Minister would not be putting taxpayers' money into

	<span class='label label-info column'>1423</span>
it. He must have evidence that it has such value as he is well known for not spending money unnecessarily. I should be grateful if the Minister could give us that evidence and say who will benefit. Often relatives of such children come to our constituency surgeries and we refer them to the education authority. However, it would be nice if we had an idea of the sort of person that the institute takes and whether that final selection will be made by the education authority. I presume that that decision will not be taken on the basis of the parents simply liking a clinic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know of clinics that come and go throughout the world. Remember Dr. Issel's clinic? I am sure that the Minister would not wish us to spend money in clinics that have no value. How will we assess those clinics?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has medical experience. He is asking how can a system be arranged whereby what are essentially unorthodox medical methods are simultaneously approved by those who approve of orthodoxy?

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that it is difficult. We cannot have parents taking their children to any clinic in the world for which the education authority must pay. Clearly, the Minister would allow treatment only in a clinic that offered therapeutic value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are unorthodox methods. For example, there are clinics in Mexico which give patients apricot juice for treating cancer. That is unorthodox and I would not go along with it. I believe that the Peto institute is not unorthodox although I do not understand what it is. Will the Minister explain how his Department will assess a clinic suggested by parents for their child? A series of clinics other than the Peto are available. Will he also give us the evidence that that clinic is of value and say why he supports it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There have been several technical questions and I shall begin by replying to the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith). The clause is not about the Peto institute, but refers to giving local authorities discretion to pay the costs of sending children overseas. It is not a matter of whether I or anyone else believes that Peto is good. A decision and judgment must be made about the needs of a particular child in particular circumstances. My amendment seeks to make it possible for local authorities to meet the costs of sending children overseas. That has not been possible for local authorities in Scotland and I am aware of examples of local authorities wanting to do so. Some have been quite ingenious—one found a way through the common good fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden said that he had been unable to find references to conductive education. The Hungarians are sensitive about the use of that term. They believe that people make claims for conductive education that does not reflect their regime. Fortunately, it will not be part
	<span class='label label-info column'>1424</span>
of my function to give an assessment about whether that method will be the best form of treatment, although it may be right for some children. My right hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) gave examples from his constituency of Peto being successful for particular families, and I had the pleasure of meeting one of his constituents. If the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden could meet such families and see the enthusiasm, commitment and results that have been achieved, he would recognise that there is a group of people for whom that option works, and it should be available to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Moray (Mrs. Ewing), for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) and for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) all referred to resources. I have already said that the financial effect of the amendment will be more or less neutral. I said that it could be cheaper for a parent to go to Peto than to stay in Scotland. Education authorities already have resources to educate children with records of needs in their areas. The measure of the Government's commitment can be gauged by the amount of financial provision made available in revenue support grants in recent years. If the hon. Member for Fife, Central examines the figures, he will see that in the eight years from 1981 to 1989-90, we increased the resources for that purpose by no less than 75 per cent, in real terms from £30.5 million to £81.4 million. That is the amount of financial provision for such children, which is an impressive record and one of which we can justly be proud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there are further representations about the revenue support grant provisions, we shall take account of them as we do not wish to see that frustrated. For those interested in the financial side of the matter and the obligations on local authorities, I can tell them that children who suffer from cerebral palsy are often highly intelligent whose only difficulty is motor deficiency. If those children can be made mobile, the options for the local authority in terms of future provision and future placements are greatly extended. In financial as well as human terms it makes sense, and at the same time the children's horizons are opened up tremendously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) seemed unsure about my figures for costs. I quoted figures for the package assembled by the Birmingham Institute of Conductive Education. The Andrew Sutton referred to by the hon. Lady is the director of that institute, and I met him in Budapest. The institute's package cost £2,000 for a two-month visit by parent and child. That figure has been confirmed in a letter from a parent in Renfrew whose expenses in Hungary were £1,000 a month. That cost is considerably less than other options, but I do not think that the financial argument should prevail over the need for the best possible care and attention for the children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) asked me about consultation with the central authorities and the Scottish Council for Spastics, and about specialised treatment in Scotland. I must confess that I had thought that it would be possible to establish fairly quickly a centre for conductive
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0803">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1425</span>
education in Scotland. I hoped that we would be able to do so. It became apparent, once I had spoken to Dr. Hari in Budapest, that it would require considerable time. One reason for the system being called conductive education is that it involves people called conductors who are physiotherapists, child psychologists and teachers rolled into one. They take four years to train and places for training are limited. Because of the stressful nature of the occupation and because it attracts younger people who go off and have families—characterists of conventional teaching—the attrition rate is high while large numbers of conductors are required to run a successful centre. The speed with which a centre can be established depends upon the number of training places. The British Government are giving support to the Hungarians to develop an international institute in conductive education, and that will mean that additional places will become available. We hope that we will be able to take advantage of not only places for children but of places for training conductors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My answer to the hon. Gentleman is yes, we will try to establish some provision in Scotland but it will take some time. I have asked officials in the Scottish Office to discuss with the bodies concerned the best way of making the most rapid progress. No one should be under any misapprehension; the option of going to Budapest for conductive education, or to Philadelphia for that institute's different approach, is not an easy one. It demands tremendous commitment on the part of the parents; it is no fun being separated from the family and working to a rigorous regime with all its attendant difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has in some ways passed the point that I intended to raise. I understand that the only other country that has trained conductors at the Peto institute is Japan. I am not making a sexist point, but I understand that Japan has had eight men trained because that country wanted to be certain that it did not lose their abilities as a result of pregnancy and child rearing. Does the Minister have similar designs, or will the opportunity be open to teachers of both sexes who already have special education qualifications?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no firm views on that point, but I am sure that the hon. Lady's comment will be taken into account. If I were to suggest that we followed the Japanese example, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) would get to her feet, accuse me of being sexist and repeat her technology academy argument from this morning. I think that I had better not go down that road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Member for Fife, Central that we will consult widely. This is one subject on which my postbag offers me pleasurable reading, because we have had tremendous support. The convener of Tayside regional council wrote asking me what he could do to help. At first, I thought that his offer was in respect of the entire Bill, but I found that it applies only to these provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both the hon. Member for Moray and my right hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and
	<span class='label label-info column'>1426</span>
Deeside—who spoke particularly of his own constituents—told me when we met that if children are sent abroad for special education it is most important that support is available to continue the regime when they come home. I could not agree more; the case that my right hon. Friend referred to involved physiotherapy. I have received similar complaints from a number of parents. We have followed them up with the authorities concerned, and are still in correspondence about some of the children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have noted the general difficulties about physiotherapy, and I am asking the Department to see how the service can be improved. It is equally important that special schools are aware of the different regimes being followed. I heard from one child's parents—I shall not identify them for fear of causing a row—that at the Peto institute children are given potty training but when they got back to this country they found that their child was being tied to the potty. That goes completely against the Peto regime. That mistake was caused by a lack of understanding of what the training involved. I have, again, asked the Department to look at ways of improving understanding and of giving information about the approaches followed overseas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the Minister's remarks with great interest. The argument for increased numbers of physiotherapists and other people specially trained for handicapped children does not apply only to the children who come back from abroad; there are children in this country whose parents have decided not to take up that option, and any enhanced budget for the handicapped under-fives should ensure earlier diagnosis and assistance for all parents with children in that group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady always comes back to money, and no doubt she is right to do so. I hope that I did not imply that I am interested in the provision of physiotherapy only for those children who have been abroad. I am anxious that it should be provided for all children with special needs, including those with motor difficulties. The same applies to adults who may have suffered head injuries, or have other disabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to look carefully at the resources available for these services. If we can help to make children mobile and respond to their needs at an early age, even on the grounds of public expenditure such training makes sense. If, as I am sure is the case, we are interested in the welfare of the child, the effects can be dramatic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it was the hon. Member for Fife, Central who asked me to provide for the Committee an analysis of the treatment at Peto. However, I cannot give a full analysis of the effectiveness of the treatment offered at Peto on the strength of a three-day visit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is quite fair. It would be useful if a report on the visit could be circulated. That
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0804">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1427</span>
would suffice. I was not suggesting that the Minister give an evaluation of the visit during the debate, but hon. Members may be interested to hear about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we discovered that for some parents the training has provided the answer. Parents are given tremendous support by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office which provides a community centre. Officials who accompanied me were impressed by what they saw. Perhaps I am coming dangerously close to doing so, but it is not my function to, nor would it be right for me to, endorse a specific approach. I believe that the choice should be available to those who might benefit from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about research, and the hon. Member for Moray said that she was not aware of any. I should be interested to read the article by Andrew Sutton from which she quoted. He is the director of the Birmingham Institute for Conductive Education, and a research project is currently being undertaken there. It is funded by the Department of Education and Science, and I understand that the results of the project will be available in two years' time. There are great difficulties in such research, and that specific project may not necessarily answer all our questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray asked about the resources and the number of children at Peto. That institute will never be able to provide for all the children in Scotland. Its places are limited, although it seems to find it extremely difficult to refuse children as we discovered when we visited it. I have explained how we hope to develop some provision in Scotland. There are between 800 and 1,600 children with cerebral palsy in the two to nine age group, of whom perhaps 300 to 600 could benefit from conductive education. Not all of them would wish to go to Peto, nor would they all benefit to the same degree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked about Doman-Delacato and quoted from a source that was fairly dismissive of it. A constituent of mine attended the Philadephia institute and has made remarkable progress. He has recruited about 40 volunteers from my constituency to take part in what is a vigorous regime. I have an open mind about Doman-Delacato. It is not a part of our functions to say whether such a system is good or bad. It is for local authorities, with the advice that is available to them, to consider parental preferences and the options available for the child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I was making was how do we ensure that parents have professional advice on the choices that are open to them? I fear that they clutch at articles that have no foundation whatever in scientific and educational research. Surely there is a responsibility on all of us, especially the Department of Education and Science, to ensure that professional advice is available, so that wrong choices are not made. I am worried about the vulnerability of the wrong choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If parents regard certain establisments as the right places for their children, it
	<span class='label label-info column'>1428</span>
is difficult to understand why they should be denied the opportunity of attending such places. It would be up to the education authority to assist those parents, and take into account the specific circumstances of each case. According to my constituent, he was advised to have nothing to do with that specific approach. That advice was ignored and the child has made tremendous progress having had the benefit of that regime. The child is no longer attending Philadephia, but progress has been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must take account of parental judgments, too. But the decision—because it is a discretionary power—will be for the local authority to make. If the local authority says that a child cannot attend a certain establishment, the parents are free to make their own choice, but they would have to fund such treatment themselves, as happended to my constituent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that it is the responsibility of the education authority to compile information on the various options open to parents? None of us wants to deny any choice to the parents of a handicapped child. We wish to ensure that the education authorities and the people who will exercise that discretion have the fullest information about each of the institutions that is available, so that they may offer professional guidance to parents and still allow them to make the final choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will not be for parents to make the final choice; the discretion will remain with the education authorities. In a sense, the hon. Lady is answering her own question. If the effect of the power is that education authorities, and the regional psychology services must focus their attention on those alternative approaches and perhaps consider them as elements, it will be a good thing. There is a tendency for people, understandably and rightly in such circumstances, to be conservative and perhaps suspicioius about something new. No doubt, parents will have had certain approaches made to them, and I agree with the hon. Lady that all parents want the best for their children. Sometimes that will blur their judgment about the reality of what is achievable for their children. However, it is not unknown for authorities to be less open-minded that one would wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the discretionary power will mean that discussion will take place and opportunities and benefits are properly evaluated, with the parents and the regional psychological services being involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members are asking the Minister to consider that the resources available to regional education authorities to allow them to draw up detailed information about and make assessments of a variety of unorthodox methods of treatment, some of which may be on the edges of faith or witchcraft, do not make their task easy. As the Scottish Education Department has far more resources and capacity, it would be better merely to provide information so that a wise and sensible decision could be reached, in so far as that is possible, as the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0805">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point, as always. I am reluctant to allow the Scottish Office to become involved in providing endorsements of particular approaches for reasons which I know he will understand. However, I take his point and will discuss what guidance and support we could provide for local authorities. I hope that when the Bill becomes an Act they will find they have a new duty. I shall certainly discuss that. Perhaps the Scottish Office could discuss it with directors of education and other bodies, as I can see that there could be genuine problems in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that I have dealt with all the points that have been made by Opposition Members. We have had a useful debate and I am delighted to have put forward a proposal at this late stage which even the hon. Member for Dundee, East was able to welcome and could tell his constituents that he was prepared to welcome it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been a long Committee, but I welcome the response of the Minister to questions posed to him. I believe that most Opposition Members welcome the possibility of a step forward in parental choice that will go further in providing the facilities and resources for Scotland which are crucial for the vast number of young people and children involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has also responded positively to the need to consult organisations and education authorities about the superstructure that must underpin any programme for the care of severely handicapped children. No Opposition Member would oppose the suggestion. If there is provision anywhere in the world that can help a family or a child we wish to support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our fears arose from an article in the 
	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> of Saturday 13 May, which said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government is believed to be contributing £10 million towards a new international conductive education centre in Hungary."</p></blockquote>
As part of the wider consultations, we seek a significant step forward in resources, for Scotland. Education authorities are pushed to provide all types of education. Most of them make special provision for handicapped children but they need resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has accepted that expectations have risen as a result of the announcement at the weekend. It would be useful if the Scottish Office not only issued guidelines but established a procedure properly to consider and translate into action the expectations of parents who will approach hon. Members, the Minister and education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) made the valid point that until now education authorities have considered placements for children only within their areas and elsewhere in Scotland. If wider avenues open up, authorities will need specialist advice. We cannot presume to understand the pressures on and emotions of parents who come to our surgeries to discuss a severely handicapped son or daughter. If they go to their education authority hoping to hear about Peto or other institutes and
	<span class='label label-info column'>1430</span>
are told, "Our professional judgment is that that is unnecessary, and we want to place the child elsewhere," they might respond in an understandably emotional way and say, "We insist that our child has this opportunity." The Minister has accepted the difficulty because he says that the education authority must deal with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Gentleman is wrong. A parent cannot insist on an overseas placement, be it at Peto or Philadelphia. Such placements are made at the discretion of the local authority. The circumstances that the hon. Gentleman suggests could not arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to say that in practice the education authority will be the final arbiter, but that in that emotional atmosphere the parent will feel aggrieved and disgruntled and wish that there was another arbiter or a right of appeal to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are complex and emotive issues, but suffice to say that the Minister has taken on board our reasonable contributions. We can expect a wider debate in Scotland. The organisations involved can look forward not only to overseas options becoming available but to more investment in education authorities and in the institutions in Scotland that deal with these youngsters. There will be a much more public debate on progress in Scottish education for a group who badly need both investment and support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are probing amendments and I shall not delay the Committee on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 65 is not clear and does not enable education authorities to place children outwith their boundaries, as they sometimes do now. Such cases may be infrequent but they are important, and the amendments seek from the Minister a guarantee that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0806">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1431</span>
the practice can continue. Otherwise, I shall feel almost obliged to press them to a Division. However, I am sure that it is not his intention to prevent these placements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The department of education at Edinburgh university published a report on children with recorded needs in 1987. It said that, of the 80 pupils placed in special residential settings in Scotland, although half were from one particlar area, all but two were placed outwith it. In other words, as many as 38 children from one regional authority can be given residential placements outside their area. I am sure that it is not the Minister's intention to stop that. It is a welcome trend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased about the growth in resources in some of our schools to enable the practice to develop further. For example, a blind child living in Fife travels to the Royal Blind School in Edinburgh and a child from Lanarkshire in the Strathclyde area travels daily to the Donaldson school in Edinburgh, showing the transfer of children across boundaries. We must look at how resources can be established in Scotland to deal with children who have minority handicaps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The developments are encouraging. There are now facilities for the deaf-blind at Carnbooth and Lendrick Muir has opened specifically for dyslexic children. There is a proliferation of units in mainstream schools. Ellon academy has a unit for the physically handicapped, and I am sure that the Minister is well aware of the facilities at Alloa in Central region. Dalziel high in Motherwell has a unit for the deaf and Uddingston grammar has a unit for youngsters with visual impairment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should encourage these facilities. It is important to increase resources in Scotland—

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank you, Mr. Hogg, although I do not think that the possibility of my being appointed to the Chairman's Panel will do much for my reputation in the Scottish National party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These developments should be encouraged and need additional resources. The Minister says that I always come back to money, but here we are not talking about large sums. We want resources for training teachers and for giving them in-service training to ensure that they can do their best for the children. We also seek investment in appropriate technology, such as the phonic ear for young children who suffer from deafness. The sooner a child becomes acquainted with the phonic ear, the better. We should encourage the use of peripatetic teachers in a variety
	<span class='label label-info column'>1432</span>
of subjects, especially at the primary stage, to help children stay in their own areas, particularly in rural and island communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One problem is that there seems to be no central register so that parents and education authorities can tap into the nearest available facilities. A central register of developments in our schools should be maintained, perhaps backed by advice from the inspectorate and the psychological services. The amendments place particular emphasis on facilities in Scotland. If we develop our existing facilities, we will create provision for future generations, not just for children now who are handicapped. We want to make such developments a permanent feature of the Scottish educational landscape.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the moves from the Minister to enable children to have a wider variety of opportunities, some of which are open to them forth of Scotland. However, we have responsibilities within our communities and I hope the Minister will make it clear that he will encourage this transfer across boundaries between education authorities to make it possible to place children near their homes. Some places may be residential, but as far as possible facilities should be developed to enable youngsters to stay at home and receive their education from their education authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the amendment we are discussing would be to restrict rather than extend the options for school placements available to parents of children with records of needs. Under existing legislation a local authority cannot refuse to accept a placing request on grounds that it can provide an alternative placement at a school which it does not manage. I see no reason to concede that principle now. Bearing in mind the fact that an authority may refuse to place a child at a school which is unsuitable for a child's needs, if the correct placement for a child is agreed to be at a grant-aided or independent special school I believe it is right for parents to be allowed to choose which of the alternatives that should be.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The repeal of the statutory procedures governing the dismissal of teachers has

been well trailed over the past few months. This is an exceedingly brief clause, but many people are concerned about the implications of section 88 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 being repealed. It is important to recall that the procedure was introduced because of the threat that could be posed to teachers in schools throughout Scotland. For many decades it was widely believed that teachers required extra protection.

	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) makes an unkind comment. I would not suggest for a moment that that is true. We welcome the Chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Teachers have enjoyed a special degree of protection, Chairman, which is now under threat. There are mixed views in Scotland about the future of the clause. Given the Government's view of the matter, however, it would be futile to discuss at length why it should not be repealed. It would be more constructive to suggest what should replace it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the Government believe that existing employment laws could cover the conditions of service and the issues surrounding the dismissal of teachers. However, the industrial tribunal procedure is helpful only after the event and the present employment laws are under almost daily attack by the Government. It could be argued that teachers would enjoy the current conditions of service that apply to most other employees, but only after those conditions had been eaten away by amendments and changes in legislation by the Government. That is no comfort to teachers in Scottish schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We live in uncertain times, with falling school rolls, demographic changes and the rationalisation of schools throughout the country. Section 88 has provided protection for teachers who are caught up in situations not of their making. It has been a powerful stimulus for education authorities to think positively about the rationalisation of human resources. It would be a pity if some authorities took advantage of the removal of the procedure to allow teachers to be dismissed without due regard to their career prospects and the quality of provision in a school or a wider educational area.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I was so rudely interrupted, I was speaking about the dismissal of teachers. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities has said that it would like to consider the removal of section 88, but that the timing is inappropriate. Mr. Malcolm Green, the chairman of the COSLA education committee, is on record as saying that. We share his view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, teaching unions have major worries about the exposure that they may endure as a consequence of the straight removal of the procedure, instead of any constructive thought being given to a substitute form of protection. We should welcome a response from the Minister based on what could replace section 88 of the 1980 Act. Bearing in mind the Government's views on education, there is no point in arguing for anything other than a fallback position that teachers might enjoy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether teachers have faced uncertainty in the past, it is clearly the Government's aim to increase that uncertainty over the next two or three years. Technology academies will be forced on areas of Scotland whether or not they want them. We will have self-governing schools because of the Government's policy. This provision will just add another tier of uncertainty on the profession, when controls on the dismissal of teachers are probably more pressing than they have been for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Government seriously consider having further discussions with COSLA and the teaching unions and associations to see whether some protection could be developed that would satisfy not only COSLA, but teachers who are represented by trade unions? There are many pressing reasons why some protection should be provided for teachers outwith the sphere of protection that is provided for other employees. The provision is an unnecessary irritation, especially at this time of change in Scottish education. We sincerely hope that the Government will take a more responsible attitude towards what may be substituted for section 88.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1436</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister consider that the employment legislation to which teachers will turn if the clause stands part, does not protect anyone who has been employed for less than two years? A teacher who has been employed for less than two years is a probationer and normally comes under the scrutiny of the GTC and the inspectorate. In earlier debates, the Minister went to some pains to pour cold water on organisations such as the GTC. Therefore, I should be interested to know what protection, if any, will be provided to probationers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that the present arrangements for the dismissal of teachers have been an undue restraint on the dismissal of incompetent teachers. It has been argued in some quarters that there is no way of judging that and it is a matter of subjective impression. I disagree. Surely we can consider other disciplinary action short of dismissal that can be taken against teachers. Various other disciplinary actions can be taken against other employees if the management is so minded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister know how many teachers in Scotland over the past five years have received official warnings? How many have had final warnings? How many teachers have suffered a loss of increments to their salaries? How many have been suspended with loss of pay? What percentage of teachers has been sent on retraining courses? I do not know whether the Minister has even tried to obtain such information, but it is relevant to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister has such information, we want to have the details. It would give us some idea of how often councillors on education committees consider that undue restraint is placed on their ability to dismiss teachers. Few teachers behave in a manner that would deserve dismissal. I am confident that the number of teachers who have received warnings or suspensions, or who have been retrained, is a tiny proportion. Therefore, the number of teachers liable to dismissal must also be extremely small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my 11 years experience of teaching in further education, I can recall only one warning being given, but no suspensions, no sackings and no compulsory retraining. Those actions have been open to management, but not used. Our conclusions must be that management is reasonably satisfied about the performance of staff, hence the low usage of those possibilities. Presumably, if section 88 of the 1980 Act ceases to have effect, it will be left to each education authority, or board of management of an opted out school, to set up whatever dismissal procedures they please, or to negotiate with the teachers' and lecturers' representatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therein lies my anxiety about clause 66. Teachers are at risk of being treated less fairly than many other employees. Councillors of all parties have been known openly to express dislike of teachers. People utter the word "teacher" in the same tone that they would use for "Thatcher".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1437</span>
people's thinking about teachers as a group. Perhaps teachers' behaviour sometimes provokes that attitude. Many have the unfortunate characteristic of speaking to other adults as if they were pupils. It would be completely unfair if the habits of the working day that spill into outside life were to affect the chances of being sacked. Those involved should consider only the facts of the case. They should not have their minds clouded by prejudices against teachers as a group. People should not be condemned out of hand because of their occupation. Issues should be decided according to the facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a councillor for many years—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And an excellent one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously. Councillors have been fair-minded enough to accept the possibility of prejudice against teachers. They have lived with the present procedures for a long time. It was not until the Committee was provided with the information that I realised that those procedures had existed since 1882. People have lived with that system for all those decades, while different parties were in control of the education authorities in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not arguing that that system should be preserved in aspic, but the Minister is proposing to do away with it and to put nothing in its place, except employment rights which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) pointed out, are being eroded by the Government. It is important to take account of the particular difficulties that teachers suffer. They are more vulnerable to unfair and untrue accusations. Aspects of their work can come under critical scrutiny that would not be applied to others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give one example from the well known case in the United States that became a cause celebre. A group of fundamentalists who ran a school in America sacked a science teacher, who taught the Darwinist theory to the pupils. If the Minister gets his way and various groups can set up whatever sort of school they please, that is not an unlikely outcome. The Minister has told us to trust parents. What would he say about a group of parents running an opted-out school who chose to dismiss a teacher on such grounds? He may believe that parents have a right to have taught whatever they please in their school, but pupils should be made aware of all relevant thinking. It would not be an educational process for their minds to be closed to the teaching of Darwinism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon. Lady's example of pressure being put on a teacher who taught Darwin's theory. Would she find it equally reprehensive if an education authority put pressure on a teacher who was writing to newpapers criticising the authority's policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not see how that question relates to what I was saying, which was about a teacher teaching pupils the knowledge that he had gained in the pursuit of his subject, but I shall answer it. If an
	<span class='label label-info column'>1438</span>
employer says that as a rule of employment employees may not communicate with the press, I would expect that rule to apply to all employees— teachers as well as the others. I cannot see what the Minister is driving at. Such a rule is rather a restriction on the employees' civil rights to communicate their views, but if that were part of the agreement that teachers, like other employees, had accepted, so be it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend care to reflect on a concrete example of what the Minister mentioned? When Tayside regional council was controlled by the Conservatives it closed primary schools. A number of its teacher employees became active in campaigns to save those schools. Many Conservative councillors called for what the Minister is apparently worried about—action against Tayside employees who dared to disagree with the education authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting intervention. Perhaps later we shall hear the Minister's view on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister can see the distinction between a teacher teaching what he or she considers appropriate subject matter in the light of widely accepted scientific knowledge and the issue of limitations should be accepted on people's civil rights to speak and write to whomever they please. In many jobs, including those in local government, confidentiality must often be respected. That is why agreements are made about restricting employees' access to the media. Whatever the agreement may be it should be adhered to by both sides. It is as simple as that, and it has nothing to do with the point at issue. I hope that the Minister will not try to evade my specific question about the possibility of teachers being sacked for teaching material such as I have described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not say that the present arrangements are perfect and should not be altered in any way, but the Minister is abandoning the safeguards without taking account of the prejudices that can exist against teachers or the risks of unfair accusations being made against them daily in the classroom—risks that do not exist in most other occupations. Has the Minister attempted to consult any bodies about a possible alternative rather than simply abandoning the present arrangements? Will he tell us whom he consulted and with what result? Why does he think it best to drop the procedure that has lasted since 1882?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would have been more constructive to try, with the education authorities and the teachers' unions, to find an alternative broadly acceptable to those who have day-to-day relationships with teachers' representatives and councillors. Parents hoping to set up an opted-out school would surely welcome guidance on such matters. They will be confronted with difficulties that they have never had to cope with before.

problems that we have mentioned. He should take a responsible attitude. In framing the clause he has shown no concern for the problems. In fairness to all concerned, including the pupils, there must be a procedure. The Minister seems to think that we are concerned only about teachers' rights, but it is also in the interests of pupils that proper arrangements for such matters should be made. They should not be left to the mercies of whatever shreds of employment protection legislation remain after the Government have finished their task of taking employment protection rights apart.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief as I note that Opposition Members are keen to add to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support clause 66 and I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on providing it. It is sensible to bring provisions affecting teachers into line with those that affect other employees. Opposition members will not recall, as they were not here at the time, that I introduced a proposal, which I note that you, Mr. Hogg, well remember, on Report of the Bill that is now the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. It was a probing amendment and we held a rather lengthy debate on it which started at 7 pm and ended at about 4 am. No doubt, the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing), who reminded us of that, will have the exact times in her records.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that time, the proposal was seen to be controversial. My new clause was negatived technically, but I had said that I would withdraw it. A tremendous number of representations were made about it from all quarters. In the context of this Bill, it is interesting to note the lack of fundamental widespread opposition to the clause. I am not suggesting that Opposition Members are in favour of it—their speeches made it clear that they are not— but a sign that times have changed is that no great concern about clause 66 has been expressed. Attention has been focused on other matters in the Bill and that is in marked contrast to what happened in 1980 when there was an extensive campaign against the idea embodied in the clause. Therefore, it is with a sense of original authorship that I support the clause. I am extremely relieved that the debate will be somewhat shorter than it was when I originally raised the matter on the Floor of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is depressing to realise that if one wants to know what the Government plan to do in three or four years' time, one need only look at whatever probing amendments the hon.

	<br><blockquote><p>"In our view the protection of section 88 has been overtaken by that contained in employment protection legislation. It is now an anachronism and we recommend that it should be repealed when an opportunity arises."</p></blockquote>
That opportunity now arises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That could not be clearer. I shall now continue with the point that I am trying to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for teachers to have a proper sense of security. Section 88 of the 1980 Act provides that a teacher cannot be dismissed without a resolution being passed through an education authority committee. Three weeks' written notice of the meeting must be given to the teacher and all members of the education authority. At least half the members must be present and two thirds must vote in favour of the resolution for dismissal. That is perhaps public and cumbersome, but it is essential for teachers to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0811">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1441</span>
have a sense of security. Being employed as a teacher is a different experience from other types of employment. For most of their working day, teachers are alone with their pupils in a classroom which could leave them open to accusations that may or may not be well-founded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) said that pupils should be made aware of Darwin's theory and so on, but pupils become aware that it is easy to dismiss a teacher whom they do not like and all sorts of allegations may be made against him. It is important for teachers to know that unfair allegations will be handled properly and that their position will be properly protected under the existing legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That legislation was not drafted with teachers in mind. It applies generally to all different types of employment. Teacher employment is different, which springs from their being alone in a classroom with pupils. I know of 25 or 26-year-old male teachers being alone in a room with six or seven 15-year-old girls. Any one of those girls could get into a dispute with a teacher and they could gang up against him. It would be hard for him to defend himself against allegations if they all took the same line. Does the employment legislation cover that sort of situation? Perhaps section 88 of the 1980 Act gave the teacher some sense of protection, knowing that he could go to the committee and that the girl would have to ensure that her allegations could be sustained through the public procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same is true of the relationship between the teacher and the employer. In self-governing schools, the employer will be the boards of management, but they can have no idea of how teachers perform as teachers. So I suspect that the decision will be made by the head teacher, who will have to make a genuine judgment about a person's performance as a teacher, both in the classroom and outside in terms of correcting homework, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm

In theory, it is possible for a teacher to be victimised by a vindictive head teacher who does not like him, but how can the teacher ask his union representative to defend him? There is no problem on the shop floor, where the union representative and the management are at hand, where everyone knows what is going on, and where allegations are made publicly about activities that are carried on publicly. But when an allegation is made by a head teacher about a teacher's incompetence, no one else really knows whether that is true. How does the EIS or SSTA representative defend the teacher when he does not know what goes on in the teacher's classroom? So in removing section 88 we may be removing some of the defences and protection which teachers need as teachers and which are different from the protection that people require as employees in other industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill made a fair point about someone being attacked and the head teacher alleging incompetence simply because the way in which a person teaches is not acceptable to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1442</span>
that head teacher or the board of management. There is no protection for a teacher in that position. There is no appeal beyond the head teacher and the board of management. That is where the appeal ends, and it is not possible to appeal to the education authority—the stage beyond the people who have a fundamental disagreement with the teacher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to my other concern about teachers being judged by the examination results of their classes. The Minister seems shocked that I should even raise the matter. He should realise that teachers do not teach the same classes, and that ability in classes varies enormously. A good teacher can have poor performance results from some pupils, while a less able teacher can produce better results from other pupils. At no stage during our deliberations has the Minister or any Tory Back-Bench Member explained how that will be taken into account or how the assessment of teachers will reflect the calibre of pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the debate on staff development that we had earlier today it was interesting that the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) moved from an extreme to a moderate position, saying that no one would be sacked and that nine tenths of teachers who come under staff development will have resources directed at them and be made into better teachers. He said that very few would be dismissed. If that is so, why is it necessary to abolish section 88 if the 1980 Act? Why go to all that bother? I suspect that it is because the occasions will not be as few as we are told. I suspect that Conservative Members want as many sackings as possible and want it made as easy as possible to sack people. That is the real reason for the abolition of section 88.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman persists in misrepresenting what I said, may I put this question to him: is he saying that there are no circumstances in which a teacher should be dismissed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I mentioned his name, the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle had his head buried in a book. He has not listened to a word of this debate. I am suggesting no such thing. If we keep section 88 of the 1980 Act, it will allow the sacking of teachers who deserve to be sacked, and I am attempting to defend the retention of that section.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am well aware of that, but the hon. Gentleman knows that the procedures under that provision are so cumbersome that in reality it rarely happens. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will now answer the question that I persistently put all morning to him and to the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish): once the Opposition accept the principle of appraisal and acknowledge that there are both good and bad teachers, how can they persist in the view that, as a result of appraisal, the only sanction left to a local authority is to apply more resources to the problem? Other sanctions may be necessary in the end. Hon. Gentlemen have refused to answer that question time and again; perhaps the hon. Gentleman will now wish to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to know exactly what point the hon. Gentleman is making. Earlier today, he said that only rarely would teachers be sacked as a result of appraisal. Now he thinks that it will be quite common and wants me to agree with him. I do not agree. I do not think that teachers should justifiably be sacked in large numbers. Teachers who do not perform well should be helped to perform better rather than be sacked. That is a difficult concept for the hon. Gentleman to accept because he comes from a different tradition—the bosses' tradition of sorting out the workers and sacking them. I come from a tradition that tries to defend workers' rights and to prevent workers from being thrown out of the door, and on to the dole. That is what we are persistently trying to defend in this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman considers it important to be able to sack teachers, why does not the provision apply to private schools? Those schools were exempted from section 88 of the 1980 Act and, with the abolition of section 88, they will, in effect, still be exempted from the obligation to sack teachers, or to have them sacked easily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, technology colleges will be private schools although they will receive direct funding. Their teachers will not be affected because they did not have the protection in the first place. On second thoughts, I should probably not have argued for extended protection for them within private schools because it is their own affair if they wish to work in those schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be a consistent approach. In a sense, I suppose that there is one; it seems to be argued that if it is easy to sack teachers in private schools it should be easy to sack those in public schools. I think that that is what the Minister is saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Got it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that I have got it. The problem is that private schools are not accountable to the public although they receive large amounts of public funds, which is an abomination, a disgrace and an outrage. The Minister has been instrumental in achieving public funding for private schools in one form or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The experience in Scotland is that the majority of teachers who perform below their capacity do so because of particular problems—ones that can be remedied if sufficient time and effort is expanded on them. That is the way to improve education in Scotland. We should not make it easier to dismiss, sack or throw teachers out of the door. We know that that will be necessary if it is wished to create an independent sector out of the self-governing school sector. If people are moved forcibly from the public or the education authority sector into the self-governing sector, they will go reluctantly. If it is then wished to move a self-governing school out of the public into the independent sector, there will be teacher resistance. But we know what the Minister wants: if there is resistance at that stage, he will want to sack those teachers to make it easier to bring in those who will do the bidding of the board of management and jump from the public to the private sector. That
	<span class='label label-info column'>1444</span>
is what it is all about. It has nothing to do with cumbersome public exercises but with making it easier to get rid of teachers who do not toe the political line that the Minister wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned the 1986 Main report. I read that report in its entirety and think that I have forgotten entirely. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). We are being honest today. Both of us are tired, but certainly not emotional. It may be because of the stage we have reached in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Main report mentioned such matters but, as I recall, it gave no evidence. Will the Minister give evidence to show how section 88 has impeded progress in teaching? If he does not do that, we can perhaps rightly say that the proposal is part of the macho mentality that the Minister has displayed about education. Section 88 does not look good from a Right-wing, free market point of view, therefore it must go. The Minister must give us that evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 88 was drawn up 100 years ago to prevent the sacking of teachers by vindictive employers for frivolous reasons. It is ironic that the section was drafted because of Government anxiety that teachers were vulnerable because they were employed by school boards. They will be employed by school boards again, but section 88 has to go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East said that teachers may be in a sensitive position in some classes. I am aware of that because I have been in classes and, as an assistant head teacher, dealt with, sensitive matters involving parents and teachers. Recourse to public exposure in such cases is important, and it is provided by section 88. Under that section, when a case goes to the education authority, half the members of the education committee must be present and two thirds must vote in favour. It is a democratic procedure, and if the Minister has no evidence—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that a two thirds vote effectively gives the trade unions a blocking mechanism?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the hon. Gentleman talk about trade unions? We are discussing an education committee. Individuals sit on a committee not because they are trade unionists, but because they are elected councillors, who may be Labour, Conservative or independent. The hon. Gentleman's assertion is wrong. He does not understand that section of the 1980 Act which relates to councillors on education committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fairness to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh), there are teacher representatives on education committees, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but it does not give teacher representatives the whip hand, as they are in the minority. They have a nominal role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In England and Wales, the Education Reform Act 1988 gives powers to governors to decide whether to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0813">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1445</span>
sack teachers. Sadly, it will not be long before that power comes to Scotland. The Government say that teachers have recourse to the safeguard of employment protection legislation. But that legislation offers no protection against dismissal by individual schools. The employment protection legislation offers redress after dismissal, but it does not give teachers the same protection as section 88. It does not necessarily include reinstatement to a teaching job, as judgments in industrial tribunals show.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In balancing their budgets, school boards must consider the cost of employing teachers. Schools boards will want to remove teachers not only for alleged misdemeanour or incompetence but because of falling rolls. A school board could dismiss a teacher who would have no recourse other than to an industrial tribunal for redress but not for reinstatement. Compared with section 88, the protection offered is almost non-existent. Teachers fear for the future, especially as trial by tabloid is possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposals undermine accountability and the professional relationship between teachers and their local authority employer. No teacher in Scotland facing the prospect of school boards and the removal of section 88 will forget the public media trial of the head teacher of Jordanhill college. When school boards are in place there would be nothing to prevent a similar public trial if section 88 were removed. Certificated lecturers in further education would be equally vulnerable because of the new college councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Teachers have much to fear not only because of the attack on section 88, but because of the Government's stance and ministerial statements. They are vulnerable because of the stripping of protection when section 88 ceases to have effect. Can the Minister give a rational reason why the Government want to modify section 88? We fear that it will be abolished and not replaced. Existing legislation does not allow for the dismissal of teachers who have much to fear from clause 66.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without going into the ins and outs of the circumstances at Jordanhill and what the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) described as the public trial of a head teacher, I believe that the board of management behaved properly. It refused to discuss the issue with the press. I agree that the process was extended, too public and was not the proper way to proceed with a dismissal. That was because the board of management followed the section 88 procedure, which is a reason why the clause seeks to abolish it. If the hon. Gentleman is critical of what happened at Jordanhill, he must also be critical of the section's requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman pointed out that the provision has existed for over 100 years and was introduced to protect the interests of teachers who were employed by school boards. I acknowledge his acknowledgement that school boards are part of the tradition of Scottish education. However, he failed
	<span class='label label-info column'>1446</span>
to point out that over a century ago there was no employment protection legislation. Teachers should have the same employment protection as all local authority employees. The review of section 88 will bring to an end outdated provisions for dealing with the dismissal of teachers and will put them on an equal footing with other local government employees who do not have recourse to such a provision. The existing arranagements, which are both cumbersome and public, have now been overtaken by the safeguards contained in general employment protection legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have expressed concern about teachers losing their jobs. The Government do not employ teachers and cannot therefore dismiss them. It is for individual authorities to decide what arrangements should replace section 88. Section 88 prescribes procedures to follow when an education authority proposes to dismiss a teacher. It applies to school teachers and certificated teaching staff in further education who are employed by education authorities and to teachers working in former list-D schools or residential homes. The key provisions are a requirement that not less than one half of the members of the education authority are present at the meeting and that a resolution for a dismissal should be agreed by at least two thirds of the members present. Therefore, a resolution to dismiss must be passed by at least one third of the total membership of the authority. In practice, it is the custom for motions for dismissal in terms of section 88 to be considered by an authority's full education committee and for teachers to be heard by the committee before a decision is taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1986 Main committee concluded that the procedures under section 88, which date back to the previous century, were cumbersome, exceedingly public and did not give established teachers safeguards additional to those provided by general employment protection legislation. The hon. Member for Dumbarton said that he had forgotten everything that he had read in the Main committee's report. I know the feeling, but I refreshed my memory while considering this legislation. To be fair to the Main committee, it took evidence from a wide range of parties, including the teachers' associations and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. COSLA's stance was extraordinary and similar to that of St Augustine who prayed, "Oh Lord, make me pure, but not yet." COSLA accepted that section 88 should cease to have effect, but did not think that the timing was right. That was its view in 1986.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) asked me what thought had been given to a replacement for section 88. That is for the local authorities. She also asked for information about the number of warnings and other disciplinary measures. She knows that such information is not available centrally. We have been motivated not by the incidents of disciplinary measures, but by the principle of not having exceptional provisions to single out one category of local authority staff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that these matters are for the employing authorities to deal with, but he and his colleagues sought to amend the Bill. That escape hatch is not appropriate, because he chose to take up the issue and to decide that changes had to be made. I asked about the level of disciplinary action taken against teachers because that would show how necessary the changes were, and the Minister airily says that that is the business of the employers.

The hon. Lady should put her questions to COSLA. COSLA, like Strathclyde, may be more progressive about the matter. They have certainly considered it for at least three years. It is generally accepted that section 88 procedures are anachronistic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend deal with a question that arose in the speech of the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall)? The hon. Gentleman swept aside my view that, given the two thirds requirement and the presence of teacher representatives on committees, teachers have a large say, if not complete blocking power. Does my hon. Friend know of any other profession where trade union representatives have similar powers? Given the two thirds requirement, how many teachers have been dismissed other than for misconduct? If the Opposition accept appraisal do they intend to go further than allocating more resources?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. It is unsatisfactory to require a two thirds vote and to include teacher representatives on the committee. The Widdicombe committee made recommendations on that. My hon. Friend makes a perfectly reasonable point and I agree that it is odd to single out teachers in that way. That is a reason for the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is also right to point out that appraisals assess strengths and weaknesses, and identify teachers who can be supported. As Opposition Members bravely acknowledged today, some teachers choose the wrong profession and are
	<span class='label label-info column'>1448</span>
not up to the job. No amount of support can help such teachers, for whom dismissal and the choice of another career is appropriate. In those cases, it is desirable that the procedure for dismissal should be as private and unprotracted as possible. A highly public, long drawn-out procedure is not in the interests of the teacher, yet section 88 provides for that. There is widespread agreement about it within local authorities and the managements involved.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

Education authorities can make special arrangements for any group of staff if they wish. The hon. Gentleman should make his representations not to me or to the Committee, but to COSLA. He also asked about the procedures in self-governing schools. Schedule 1 specifies proper procedures for appeal, which will be written into the scheme of government. I recall that the hon. Gentleman went on about that at length when we discussed it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 66 is necessary. It does not undermine teachers' employment rights, but takes a sensible way forward. It enables the management in schools to operate without the highly cumbersome procedure which the Main Committee recommended should be abolished at the first opportunity.

I shall not delay the Committee, as this is only a probing amendment.

What does he envisage the Secretary of State having to deal with, in introducing additional orders and regulations? The subsection provides,

Although subsection (4) may appear to be unrestrictive, any order or regulations made would have to relate to a particular statutory power. The subsection would not give the Secretary of State discretion to issue subordinate legislation on whatever he chose. The hon. Lady will be relieved to hear that.

I was saying that over the years it has been a matter of argument whether the chair of the university court should be chosen in a way that some describe as haphazard and sometimes throws up people who have not the slightest intention of doing the job. But that has allowed the students at the old Scottish universities a unique opportunity to choose as their representatives people whom they believe to be eminent and worthy of trust, although they may not be fully working rectors. That is a recent expression. I shall reminisce for a short time, as other hon. Members do so. When I was a student in the early 50s—a halcyon time—working rectors were not usual. I was extremely vigorous in a campaign to have Mr. Peter Ustinov elected as rector of Edinburgh university. We did not expect him to chair every university court, but we thought he was a good chap of good Liberal opinions. But, unfortunately, he was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0816">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1451</span>
not elected—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> If that was a derogatory comment about Liberals, I must inform the Committee that one of the positive aspects of rectorships is that they enable Liberals to be elected to something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many rectors are not fully working rectors, but they are people who represent centres of influence, although that influence may not be entirely impartial because those who are chosen as rectors are seldom impartial. They are elected as centres of influence in the university but are outside the university establishment. They represent protection for students and a check on autocratic principles. We should be in no doubt that autocratic principles exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government, for reasons of their own, have decided to change this, but have failed to find any compromise agreement between the universities which is acceptable to them all. Therefore, the Government have introduced this simple unilateral abolition of the office of rector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) and myself would apply the same logic to this issue as the Government claim to be following in the rest of the Bill—that of passing on to the consumers of education the right to make important decisions on how places of learning are run. In this case, the consumers are the students. I am sure that the Minister, who is rigorous in his logic, would accept the illogicality of the Government's approach. The amendment would leave the initiative to dispose of the post of rector, but would subject it to a student vote. The hon. Member for Moray and I do not claim that the amendment has been drafted using the proper terminology, but that is its intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The weakness of the amendment—which is, after all, a fallback position—is that once a rector was abolished by one set of students, there would be no means by which another set of students could reinstate the post in the future. That is certainly a disadvantage, particularly because I do not think that the post should be done away with in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While sustaining this fallback position, I should like to say that the hon. Member for Moray and I are attracted by amendment No. 75, tabled by the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). That amendment would sustain the status quo, which we support, but would regularise the position of non-participatory rectors. We would contemplate withdrawing amendment No. 134 to make way for amendment No. 75, depending on how the debate develops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I can conclude my remarks before the vote in the Chamber. I repeat that the post of rector, enjoyed by our ancient Scottish universities, provides an opportunity for persons of distinction outside academic life to be involved in university life. That is good for the universities. It is a valuable cross fertilisation, and it also represents a safety valve for students. Occasionally, it also provides the opportunity to make a political statement. All that is good, and I see no merit in the Government's proposals to abolish rectors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak to amendment No. 75 in the names of my right hon. Friend the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1452</span>
Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith), my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and myself. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir Russell Johnston) for saying that he and the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) might withdraw amendment No. 134 so that amendment No. 75 can be put to the vote. Subject to the debate, we intend to divide the Committee on amendment No. 75, if necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber spelt out what this tradition means. For 130 years, students of the ancient universities have had the right to elect rectors and those rectors have been the chairmen of the university court. At the end of his speech, I think that the hon. Gentleman was talking about the abolition of rectorship, although I may have misheard him. In fact, amendment No. 75 deals with the rector's right to chair the university court. Like the hon. Gentleman I shall resist the temptation to reminisce about my days at St. Andrews, Scotland's most ancient university. However, I am glad to tell the Committee that I participated in the successful campaign to elect C. P. Snow as rector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, as the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir R. Johnson) said, rectors were elected on the basis of their fame and very often they were symbols. Gladstone, Disraeli, Churchill, Lloyd George and Asquith were all elected. Rectors were expected to make a resounding rectorial address and then depart. They were not expected to be working rectors—that is a much more recent tradition. Recently, students have in general expected rectors to turn up and chair the university court reasonably regularly. Members of the House of Commons have been elected. The hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) was rector of Dundee university, which is not affected by the amendment, and the hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) was rector of Edinburgh university.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the Government have a perfect right to use a legislative opportunity to put forward arguments for change. Those arguments are first, that the university court makes important decisions. As the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber said, the rector is not elected by the students for that purpose. In principle, the rector is elected as a representative or symbol. Secondly, in the absence of the rector, the principal takes the chair of the university court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was expanding on the disadvantages of the present system and was saying that the chairman of the university court was not elected by students for that specific purpose but for other reasons.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0817">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1453</span>
The second problem with the status quo is that the principal, in effect, is vice-chairman of the court and so acts as chairman in the rector's absence. There are good arguments against the principal being chairman of the court. As he is already chairman of the senate he is, in effect, the chief executive of the university. However, the court's roll is to oversee the activities of the chief executive and the administration, taking into account the wider range of interests. Furthermore, the principal may not wish to act as chairman of the university court, partly for those reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need strong evidence that those problems result in difficulties before lightly tampering with our strong educational traditions. It would be wrong to generalise from any set of circumstances, but I shall outline the problem that has occurred in one of our four Scottish universities. Of the other three, Mr. Willis Pickhard is rector of Aberdeen university. The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir Russell Johnston) knows him well, as do I, because he was the first student whom I met when I went up to St. Andrews, as our rooms were opposite. He converted me to the Liberal party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My political traditions have been continued intact: the Liberal party moved in a different direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rector of St. Andrews is Mr. Nicholas Parsons: St. Andrews has an excellent tradition of electing good rectors. The rector of Edinburgh is Muriel Gray—she would not be a candidate for membership of the no turning back group. The problem arises in the fourth university because Glasgow students have decided to elect Winnie Mandela. It is not appropriate to speak at length on whether that was a wise decision, but they have elected a rector who cannot chair the court, because she is never in the country. That raises a genuine problem for the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment would maintain the students' right to elect a rector to be chairman of the court. That historic right of Scottish students has existed for 130 years. However, my amendment also meets the practical problem of a rector who, for whatever reason, does not attend the university court or who states that he or she will not be able to attend regularly. In those circumstances, the university court would have the right to elect its own chairman from among the lay members of the court in the way outlined in paragraph 1 of schedule 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received a serious criticism of my amendment in a letter from the university of Aberdeen Students' Representative Council. It states that my amendment is an improvement to the Bill, but that
	<br><blockquote><p>"In recent times the Principal's role has become increasingly one of management and it is one of the duties of the Court to oversee the Principal's exercise of this function. We feel that it would be advantageous from both a constitutional and managerial point of view to retain the Rector's chairmanship of Court. We suggest that a vice-chairman should be elected from the lay membership of Court to serve for an appropriate term."</p></blockquote>
Clearly my amendment would not do that although it would not be difficult to amend subparagraph (5A) of schedule 10 to achieve that objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1454</span>
The amendment supported by my right hon. and hon. Friends meets the practical problem of a rector who does not attend regularly. It will also maintain the students' right to elect the chairman of the university court. To many people—and I use the word used by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir Russell Johnston)—that might appear to be an anachronism. It might appear to lack logic, but we should not lightly tamper with the traditions of our ancient universities without an overwhelming case for change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Russell Johnston</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that is was an anachronism. I may have conveyed that impression when I said that it was haphazard, but the hon. Gentleman's amendment is trying to deal with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The university courts which put forward the proposal currently in the Bill appear to be divided. I hope that the Minister will tell us which ones support the changes proposed in the Bill and which ones do not. The amendment will maintain the historic rights of Scottish students and deal with the practical problems that have emerged. I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to support the amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) and the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir Russell Johnston) have covered most of the arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us were surprised by the provision in the Bill, but we considered it seriously because it had been suggested by the universities. We do not take lightly recommendations that come from the universities or which are supported by them. In the first instance, I recognised the position at Glasgow university that my hon. Friend described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as I began to study the matter more closely, I realised that the Bill goes further than simply dealing with the situation at Glasgow university, and that sponsorship would come from the courts of the universities. To use the old-fashioned word, universities are made up of more than one "estate". The court is an important estate of a university in terms of its management; but there is also the senate, which represents the academic, teaching and research element, and the student body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing an ancient right enjoyed by the student bodies in all four universities. As my hon. Friend said, it is something that we should not tamper with lightly. Such a change is worthy of consideration if there were a strong body of support behind it. But, as I said in the first place, the measure was not supported broadly by all the universities, although there was a reason for making a change in one university. Secondly, it did not take account of other estates within the universities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not blame my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State or the Minister, but it is evident that the courts put forward the proposal without consulting either the academic or student bodies within the university. That is certainly the case in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0818">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1455</span>
Aberdeen university—the nearest one to my constituency. If we are minded to change an ancient right of universities, we must carefully consider the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). His amendment deals adequately with the Glasgow situation. In the absence of the rector, who is a lay member of the university court, I agree that the vice-chairman who would preside in his place should be another lay member. The amendment should be accepted, even if it has to be tidied up at a later stage. I hope that the Committee will consider the matter again. I think that we can deal with the specific difficulty faced in Glasgow, and we can tidy up the provision by ensuring that the court's deputy is a lay member. That would solve the problem satisfactorily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In discussing the matter in this way, we are responding to a great extent to the feelings of students in our ancient universities in Scotland. It is right that their views are expressed in Committee, especially as they do not seem to have been consulted adequately about the provision in the past. My hon. Friend's amendment, after it has been redrafted at a later stage, would put a specific responsibility back on to the student body. I hope that it is one which it will accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am prepared to back the point of view of students—as are other members of the Committee— because we believe that such an ancient right is worth preserving. The students can demonstrate to us they can elect to the rectorship either a person who can take an active part in chairing the court, as has previously been the case, or someone of standing who may not be able, because of other commitments, physically to attend every university court. By supporting my hon. Friend's amendment, it shows that we have some faith in the responsibility of the student body in our ancient universities. I hope that if my hon. Friend is successful—I shall do all that I can to make sure that he is—we also have a response in the future from the student body of the universities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that the message goes out clearly from the Committee to the student body in Scotland that we have listened seriously to the points that it has made to us. It has been interesting to guage the reaction to the provisions of schedule 10 since the Bill was published. Although the student body has been the main lobbying group, many interested individuals who are concerned about our universities believe that they will act to the detriment of our universities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be useful for hon. Members who are still hesitant about how they should vote on this matter if I cited one or two former rectors. Lord Hailsham, no less, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When I was Lord Rector of Glasgow I certainly enjoyed taking the Chair and I believe that the then principal welcomed my doing so. I see no reason to alter the status quo of an institution which has endured for so long."</p></blockquote>
Katherine Whitehorn, who was rector of St Andrews from 1982 to 1985, said:
	<span class='label label-info column'>1456</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"If Rectors were not to chair the Court, it would only be a matter of time, I imagine, before they were abolished altogether as an expensive luxury; and I do strongly feel that the various warring factions need an outsider who is neutral to play umpire at Court meetings."</p></blockquote>
Those are the comments of two rectors and I do not think that any member of Committee would regard them as irresponsible individuals. We must treat our student body as responsible people. The democratic process should be observed by these students. They should have the right to appoint someone as their rector and to ask him or her to take on the task of chairing the court meetings. To say that they should not have this facility degrades the post itself and in some ways insults our students. After all, these are people who within a few years will take on many of the most serious jobs in society, in the medical and legal professions and so on. Our students have the attitudes that enable them to choose rectors who will work for them and will represent their views at court meetings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber (Sir Russell Johnston) I would be happy to withdraw our amendment to support amendment No. 75 moved by the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). It covers some of the ground which we did not cover in our amendments and is more effective. It may not yet be perfect, but it would be a vast improvement on the present schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment deals with what has been described by the other hon. Members who have spoken in the debate as the ancient rights of students. When one considers ancient rights one should look at how they were established. I shall quote from the Act of Union which is bedside reading for all hon. Members. We shall be dealing in later amendments with the Church and I apologise if the introduction touches on part of that but it relates to the universities. Article 22 of the Act of Union of 1707 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"And further, for the greater security of the foresaid Protestant religion and of the worship, discipline and government of this Church as above established, her Majesty, with advice and consent foresaid, statutes and ordains that the Universities and Colleges of St. Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh as now established by law shall continue within this Kingdom for ever".</p></blockquote>
That is an interesting Act of Parliament. We are dealing with the ancient rights that have evolved within the universities. In this so-called enlightened age we should not tamper with things that work. We understand what has brought this about. It would be wrong if any student of history were to imagine that because at one time a group of students had behaved oddly or in a way that was damaging to their cause, the law of the land would be changed to deal with that. It is sad that Glasgow students elected a person who cannot carry out her duties as chair. I do not know what point they were trying to make, but if they were serious about how the court was to be conducted they would not have elected Winnie Mandela; as she cannot attend, she cannot not carry out her duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals with the Mandela factor. If the individual elected by the students is unable, for whatever reason, to attend for three consecutive meetings, action could be taken. This matter is too
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0819">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1457</span>
important to take away students' rights. Those rights are fundamental to the universities which exist for the students and for no other reason. I sometimes think that those who work in the universities forget that and think that the universities exist for their benefit. It is important that other activities take place in universities, but they exist primarily for students.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All three estates of the university are important. The Minister should listen carefully and understand how deeply we feel about those ancient rights. I shall refer to other ancient rights when we deal with the amendments on religious education. We ignore such matters at our peril. The system in Scotland, of which universities are a part, is unique and we are proud of it. It has evolved since earlier times and we have given groups and individuals rights in law, by custom and by convention and that has made us what we are. If we removed those rights we would be tampering with the structure on which Scotland was built. Our education system is the envy of the world. Our ancient universities have produced many of the world's greatest thinkers and inventors and we should be proud of that. The Committee should think seriously and carefully before rejecting the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions in schedule 10(1) were made in an attempt to be helpful. It is not the Government's policy in the reform of education to alter the chairing of the university courts or the position of rectors. The provisions were drawn up in response to a request to my right hon. and learned Friend by the chairman of the executive committee of the Scottish universities acting on behalf of the ancient universities, and as a listening, sensitive and responsive Government, we tried to meet that request.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perfectly apparent from the views of the Committee and from what happened subsequently that there are diverging views on the best way forward, and in this Committee there is a strong feeling that the office of rector of the ancient universities should continue to carry with it the right to chair the courts. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle for his support in our predictment, but nothing has been said to show that the Committee wishes anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have to tell my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood that his amendment is technically deficient. As he himself said, it would not be an answer to all the grumbles and grievances about the Winnie Mandela situation and the problems of other universities. I understand the Committee's wish to retain the rector chairing the university courts and the four ancient universities, and I ask my hon.

We all recognise the problems facing the university of Glasgow, and I would be happier if my hon. Friend would amend the Bill along the lines suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood so that the deputy chairman of the court would be a lay member of the court. That would be the ideal solution.

	<br><blockquote><p>"(aa) in subsection (1) the words 'be at liberty to' shall be deleted.".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is fairly limited, but I hope that it will lead to a general debate on religious education and observance. The Education (Scotland) Act 1872 transferred the responsibility for school education to the Scottish Office, and in particular transferred to the state system the schools previously run by the Church of Scotland, the Free Church of Scotland and the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland. The provisions in that Act affecting religious education were continued in the Education (Scotland) Acts 1918 and 1980, which the schedule proposes to amend, so the provisions have remained largely unchanged. The original 1872 Act states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"And whereas it has been the custom in the public schools of Scotland to give instruction in religion to children whose parents did not object to the instruction so given, but with liberty to parents, without forfeiting any of the other advantages of the schools, to elect that their children should not receive such instruction, and it is expedient that the managers of the public schools shall be at liberty to continue the said custom",</p></blockquote>
and there is a subsequent conscience clause. Except for the change from
	<br><blockquote><p>"managers of the public schools"</p></blockquote>
to the term "education authority", the wording has remained wholly unchanged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to take out the words "be at liberty to". There would be an obligation on education authorities to continue religious education and observance where they already existed. There is no question in the amendment of any compulsion of schools that do not have such a tradition. I stress that, because hon. Members may have received a press release from the EIS alleging that my hon. Friend the Minister intends to introduce in Scotland the parts of the Education Reform Act 1988 that relate to collective worship. The press release contains many other allegations, but I shall
	<span class='label label-info column'>1460</span>
not mention them because I know that we are anxious to make progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about the continuation of the Scottish tradition where it already exists. There is no question of anglicising anything. The present state of religious education and observance in Scotland is unsatisfactory. The Scottish Education Department's 1986 report, "Learning and Teaching in Religious Education" summed up the position as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nearly all schools inspected since 1983 claim to provide religious education as part of the curriculum. However, provision varied from regular and frequent lessons in all classes in denominational schools and some non-denominational schools to spasmodic and occasional teaching in others. In addition, most schools had some form of religious assembly on a weekly, fortnightly, monthly or termly basis. A majority of non-denominational schools had no planned policy for religious education and followed no guidelines from regional or national sources. In many cases it was left to individual teachers whether to teach the subject and, if so, what to teach."</p></blockquote>
I am not aware of any evidence that the position has changed radically since that report. Many people are worried about it, and the Church of Scotland has put out a press release that is outrageous in its attack on my hon. Friend the Minister. As a member of the Church of Scotland, I find it deeply regrettable that the Church uses the language that it does. I do not believe that it reflects the views or wishes of the majority of ministers, elders and members of the Kirk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Church of Scotland has made technical representations on religious education as a subject in the curriculum, but to my knowledge it has made no recommendations for or interested itself in any depth in the traditions or religious observance in most of our Scottish schools. That is a mistake. It should involve itself more in matters that most members regard as being rightly within its province, such as religious education and religious observance—and less in matters in which most people do not regard it as having expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a matter of astonishment to me—and I think to my hon. Friends—that the first representations that the Committee received from the Church of Scotland made no mention of religious education or religious observance in our schools. Those are surely obvious subjects for it to consider when legislation on Scottish education is going through the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 242 would meet the many anxieties that are felt about a decline in a valued Scottish tradition. It would place no obligations on schools that have, for one reason or another, no traditions. The present position is unsatisfactory. Let us take this small step towards maintaining an important part of the educational traditions of Scotland's schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Religious education—or witchcraft, as it came to be known by the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith)—has surfaced in the Committee from time to time. The Church of Scotland's committee on education, the presbytery
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0821">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1461</span>
of Dundee and the Catholic Education Commission for Scotland have all made representations to us, but, as my hon. Friend said, those representations have all been about secular matters. I know that the Bill does not deal with the curriculum, but surely some religious dimension might have been included in the church's representations. Instead, we hear from the presbytery of Dundee:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are conscious of an obligation to be concerned for the educational welfare of all our children, not least those who lack security and support, and so are less able to fend for themselves."</p></blockquote>
There is no mention of the spiritual welfare of the children. I am surprised that the opportunity was not sought, as it was in the Bill reforming education in England and Wales, to deal with religious education and observance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only representation on that seems to have been made by the Rev. Alasdair Morton, who I believe is the author of a vituperative press release which was released today on behalf of the Church of Scotland and which attacks my hon. Friend the Minister in rather un-Christian terms. The Rev. Morton sent us a booklet entitled, "Christian Teaching in Scottish Schools". It is a helpful pamphlet which deals with some of the issues that the Church of Scotland has raised with Ministers, but I shall return to that matter shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One person who has tackled the question of religious education in relation to the religious dimension of the Bill is the Rev. Dr. Robert Anderson, the chaplain of Edinburgh university, who made some astonishingly helpful contributions. For example, in the April 1989 edition of 
	<i>Life and Work</i> he wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Religious education is a joke in most schools. Christianity is not taught authoritatively as a saving faith and as an interpretation of life which offers the spiritual context in which major decisions can be taken with hope and confidence."</p></blockquote>
He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Church of Scotland could and should sponsor and organise a network of Christian schools throughout Scotland. The constitution of Church of Scotland schools should include Christianity as lifestyle and not just as an academic subject."</p></blockquote>
That struck me as being at least a constructive contribution to the debate, regardless of whether members of the Committee agree with that view. What happens to the Rev. Robert Anderson? He is denounced as not speaking for the Church of Scotland by the Rev. Alasdair Morton who has nothing to say to the Committee about religious dimension, but has everything to say about the secular dimension. If the press release and the letter are not a blatant political attack on my hon. Friend the Minister, I do not know what is. Certainly, they are not a constructive approach to our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the document which the Rev. Morton sent us, paragraph 4.2.1.2 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Education Committee agreed that the remit of the Group"—</p></blockquote>
that is the group that was considering Christian teaching in Scottish schools—
	<br><blockquote><p>"should not be extended to include worship and religious observance which would raise other and much wider issues."</p></blockquote>
I am tempted to regard that as a cop-out. Because there was an element of difficulty about religious
	<span class='label label-info column'>1462</span>
observance, that matter could not be tackled. The Church of Scotland is being absolutely certain about the political aspects of the Bill while being, unwholly uncertain about religious observance. That is most unfortunate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 4.2.3.2 of the document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The secularisation of society and of people's attitudes and values has substantially changed the status and influence of Christianity and the Church in society."</p></blockquote>
Although the document contains constructive suggestions, the Kirk appears to be prepared to spend its time on dealing with the secular aspects of the Bill, instead of getting on and tackling the problem of the secular society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go on at length as we want to make progress. I understand that there are different traditions of religious education in Scotland from in England and Wales and I do not intend to suggest that the provisions of the Education Reform Act 1988 should simply be incorporated in the Bill to anglicise it. As a member of the Church of England, it is not for me to impose my views on the Church of Scotland. Concern about religious education has been expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), the Rev. Dr. Anderson and my hon. Friend the Minister. I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to seek to remedy the omissions, in which the Kirk seems to take less interest than it does in playing politics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
8 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly believe that there is a place for a daily act of worship, although the Bill may not be the best means of bringing that forward. Religious education cannot operate in a vacuum, where it is taught but not practised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning I received a letter from the John Wood Church of England school in Cannock in my constituency. The letter details the school's celebration of 50 years on its present site. The first celebration will be a service of thanksgiving to be held in the local parish church. When I spoke to the head teacher this morning, she said that the most fitting way to begin the school's 50th anniversary celebrations was with a religious dimension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Does my hon. Friend agree that at that meeting, our hon. Friend the Minister should invite Mr. Morton to discuss how consultations should proceed, with a view to setting up more corporate acts of worship in Scottish schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that would be a splendid basis for such a meeting. The Church of Scotland should welcome the interest of a Minister of the Crown—the Minister responsible for education in Scotland—in a matter of such importance for our children. It is not an academic subject, but a matter of central significance to the education of our young people, their understanding of the importance of citizenship, and the spiritual dimension in their lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0822">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1463</span>
It is a great shame that the Kirk has seen it as its business to attack my hon. Friend the Minister. I hope that it will seek to employ his undoubted skills in advancing the cause of a higher priority for religious education in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). The spiritual welfare of our children should be seen in historical context. I spoke earlier about religion as it affected the universities. I shall now speak about the claim of right, which is an essential part of Scottish history and should be essential reading for anyone trying to understand the situation in Scotland. Parliament recognised the Church of Scotland after considerable trauma, privation and many deaths of people who wished to pursue their religious beliefs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Act of Union says in Article XXV that the Commissioners for that treaty
	<br><blockquote><p>"should not treat of or concerning any alteration of the worship, discipline and government of the Church of this kingdom as now by law established, which treaty being now reported to the Parliament, and it being reasonable and necessary that the true Protestant religion as presently professed within this kingdom, with the worship, discipline and government of this Church, should be effectually and unalterably secured, therefore her Majesty, with advice and consent of the said Estates of Parliament, doth hereby establish and confirm the said true Protestant religion and the worship, discipline and government of this Church to continue without any alteration to the people of this land in all succeeding generations; and more especially her Majesty, with advice and consent aforesaid, ratifies, approves and for ever confirms the fifth Act of the first Parliament of King William and Queen Mary intituled, 
	<i>Act ratifying the Confession of Faith and settling Presbyterian Church government".</i></p></blockquote>
We recognise what that means to Scotland and that there are parents who care deeply about the spiritual welfare of their children. Protection of those religious beliefs was written into the Act of Union in the passage that I have just quoted, and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Act of Union continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Parliament of England may provide for the security of the Church of England as they think expedient, to take place within the bounds of the said kingdom of England, and not derogating from the security above provided for establishing of the Church of Scotland within the bounds of this kingdom; as also the said Parliament of England may extend the additions and other provisions contained in the articles of union as above interest in favour of the subjects of Scotland."</p></blockquote>
The established Church of Scotland is written into the Act of Union. The Church of England is also written into the Act, and it is connected with the Episcopal Church of Scotland. That is how our religious beliefs and religious education were put in place. When the union came about, they were written into the Act in such a way as to ensure that there would be no tampering in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Education (Scotland) Act 1980, which we wish to amend by removing the words "be at liberty to", was probably the first time that any real attempt was made to slacken the view that the schools should make some effort to ensure the spiritual welfare of our children. I recongise that today's society contains more than just the individuals of the Protestant Church of Scotland, or of the Episcopalians. We have many religions. The Catholic religion says that the Catholic belief must be dealt with properly in schools, and we have many immigrants of other religions. It is important to ensure that our schools can deal with
	<span class='label label-info column'>1464</span>
that aspect of our children's welfare. Their spirital wellbeing must be looked after.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a member of the Kirk, I am disappointed that it seems to spend too much of its time attacking or interfering with outside matters. It would be well advised to look at the matter over which it has direct control and responsibility—the wellbeing of the people in the Kirk and their children. If it spent more time on that, churches would probably be fuller. We should begin in schools with a proper induction in the different religious beliefs and what religion is about—man's relationship with man and his relationship with a superior being. It is sad that those relationships often provide conflict. It would be wise to make our children aware of what could and does happen. That is why the amendment is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully support the intention of my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood in drawing attention to the Act of Union and how those rights, which are part of our history, have been protected in law. We in this Parliament should not throw overboard that for which others were prepared to die.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the debate does not turn into an attack in the Church by politicians, or a counter-accusation by the Church against politicians. None of us is served by that, least of all education in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) that the Church is not wrong in showing an interest in other matters of concern in the Bill. Education is as essential a part of people's spiritual build-up and welfare as anything else. It is right to recognise that. Furthermore, it is wrong to say that the Church is not interested. My hon. Friend and others may not agree with the conclusions in the report from the education committee of the Church of Scotland to the General Assembly. But no one who reads that report can say that the Church is unconcerned about religious education in schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I remind my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth) that the Church of Scotland represents a presbyterian form of government very different from the government of the Church of England. Its processes of government, the formulation of its policies and their discussion are different from what happens south of the border. My hon. Friend should understand a little more about those processes before saying some of the things that he has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My argument was that throughout our proceedings the Church of Scotland has offered nothing but criticism. It has complete certainty in what I consider are at least partially political views on the Bill. I read out the concern expressed by the presbytery of Dundee and it had nothing to say about the spiritual dimension. Not the Church but my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) has sought to amend the Bill in that respect. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) will accept that I said that, as a member of the Church of England, I did not consider it right for me to impose my views on the Church of Scotland.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0823">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1465</span>
But my right hon. Friend will have had time by now to read that intemperate letter from the Rev. Alasdair Morton, and we have heard nothing but criticism from the Church. As my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood said, the Church has not responded to the great concern reported by Her Majesty's inspectorate about the lack of religious education in schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend heard me say at the beginning that I hoped that the debate would not turn into another occasion for more criticism and counter-criticism. I include all parties to the debate in that hope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Church of Scotland is not alone in its criticism of certain parts of the Bill. It is as entitled as any other body in Scotland to express that criticism. Thirdly, I have some understanding of the way in which decisions are reached on policy, the preparation of reports and so on in the Church of Scotland, and my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood, understandably, does not. He acknowledged as much and I am grateful to him for having done so, but that lack of knowledge may lead to some wrong conclusions being reached. I would not inpugn the motives of those who prepared the report or those of Alasdair Morton although, as I have said, I do not think that anyone in any quarter who gives vent to acrimonious criticism serves the purpose that we are trying to serve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, if the Church of Scotland chooses to criticise politicians, it enters the arena of politics and must accept criticism in return. But the process is not one way. If politicians are unhappy with what the Church of Scotland says, its presbyterian democratic nature means that ways are open for members of any political party who are also members of the Church of Scotland to make sure that their views, too, are taken into account. In the democratic machinery of the Church those views will either prevail or otherwise. Politicians of all parties should reflect on those facts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

as quickly as I can to the serious points that have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), I have seen the press release and agree that the language is perhaps unattractive. I suspect that that has arisen because of a misunderstanding. It refers to a letter that I did not see until this evening. The letter refers to what the Church has done to encourage religious education in schools. I do not think that anyone could say that the Church of Scotland has not played and continues to play an important part in that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A certain amount of anger was caused by statements at the Conservative party conference when I said that I did not believe that the Church had shown the same vigour in its campaigning on this matter as on other matters, such as the community charge and more secular issues. I regret it if that has caused offence. It was an observation that I was entitled to make and one that seemed to evoke a certain amount of sympathy, at least among those at the Conservative party conference, who I am happy to acknowledge may not be an entirely representative source of public opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have now received a copy of that letter of 10 May, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Anything that your office can do to further improve the situation in respect of religious education will be noted with delight and great appreciation by our Committee."</p></blockquote>
There is some common ground that I wish to exploit. All members of the Committee see the need for improvement, and I echo my right hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside who said that it should not be an issue for exchanging slogans or angry words. The Church of Scotland issued a press release today; coincidentally, the Education Institute of Scotland issued one on the same subject. There may be a further press release from the Church of Scotland tomorrow, taking issue with one paragraph in the EIS press release which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Church of England is not established here and our own national church has no aspirations to established status."</p></blockquote>
There also seems to be a need for religious education among the membership of the EIS. Far be it from me to educate the EIS on the strengths and traditions of our Scottish institutions, including the Church of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I have considerable sympathy with the intention behind my hon. Friend's amendment. Religious education and observance in Scottish schools, at least in our non-denominational schools, is not in a happy state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all aware of the findings of the 1986 HMI report on "Learning and Teaching and Religious Education". Weaknesses were identified in the delivery of religious education in both primary and secondary schools due
	<br><blockquote><p>"either to uncertainty about the importance of the subject in the school curriculum or what it was seeking to achieve".</p></blockquote>
In more detail the HMI report found that while nearly all primary schools included religious education as part of the curriculum, the nature and extent of provision varied widely. The majority of schools had no planned policy and left it to individual
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0824">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1467</span>
teachers. The education authority guidelines which existed were not widely implemented and there was a failure of management to monitor and promote religious education throughout the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In secondary schools provision was unsatisfactory in many cases. Most non-denominational schools provided religious education in SI and S2, there was a fall-off in provision in S3 and S4, and only a minority of schools made any provision beyond that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The typical time allocation for religious education was one period a week and the subject was taken by a mixture of specialist and non-specialist—usually unqualified— teachers. Since 1986, in no small part due to efforts on the part of the Church, there has been some improvement, but not nearly enough. More schools now have policies for religious education, but still by no means all, and there are education authority guidelines in all the mainland authorities. But there is still a problem of implementing them. Head teachers and class teachers tend to give religious education low priority for curriculum development and in-service training. School census figures show that about 60 per cent, of non-denominational schools include religious education in the curriculum at SI and S2, about 50 per cent, at S3 and S4 and only about 30 per cent, at S5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, there are problems beyond S2. The Guidelines for Headteachers published by the SCCC in 1987 recommended a minimum of 5 per cent, of curricular time for religious and moral education in SI to S4. It is, I understand, extremely rare to find that amount of time given to religious education outwith denominational schools. Headteachers frequently interpret the guidelines to include social education in the 5 per cent. That may be legitimate where the social education programme deals with moral issues, but often the content is to do with careers and practical life skills with little reference to morality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of religious observance, which my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood emphasised, the majority of primary schools make regular provision for worship but only about half of secondary schools do so. Moreover, in this context "regular" does not mean daily, but weekly, fortnightly, or even monthly. Very few schools have daily assemblies. I hasten to assure my hon. Friend that I am far from happy about that situation and would be happy to co-operate in taking steps to improve it. Indeed, we are doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First of all, within the Scottish Education Department we now have established procedures for following up instances of deficient provision identified through reports by Her Majesty's Inspectorate. Where a deficiency is identified the inspectorate will follow up after six months, and if no improvement is evident the Department will then take the matter up with the director of education pointing out if necessary that the authority is in default of its statutory duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1468</span>
Secondly, religious education will be fully covered in our review and redefinition of the curriculum which is being undertaken as part of the 5 to 14 development programme. The SCCC has already set up a review and development group to look at religious, social and moral education, and I am confident that the report of that group and the consequent revision and redefinition of the curriculum in this area will be of great service to education authorities and teachers in describing the place of religious education and the means of ensuring that proper provision for it is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am determined to see the rightful place of religious education and observance recognised, and I fully support the force of the arguments that have been put by my hon. Friends the Members for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth). I welcome the spirit of the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood but alas, the flesh is weak. It would be wrong to accept it without first getting the benefit of the advice of the churches. I now know from the letter that I received on 10 May that the churches are not convinced that legislative action is required. I undertake to invite the churches to discuss the issues with me and to impart to them the flavour of our debate tonight. I assure my hon. Friend that in addition to the measures that we have already taken and those that we intend to take, which I have just described, we shall be ready to take whatever further action seems appropriate in the light of the advice that we receive from the churches. They are ready to give us advice on a number of issues, and I look forward to hearing their views on these matters, which must be central to their concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that on that basis my hon. Friend will withdraw his amendment. The Committee will be indebted to him for giving us the opportunity to discuss the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
