	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Raynsford 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. In the record of our previous debate on Tuesday 12 March at column 5961 referred to the damage to the Barkentine estate in Tower Hamlets caused by the recent IRA bomb at Canary Wharf. Unfortunately, that was recorded as "the Barkingside estate"; there is a Barkingside estate elsewhere; I would not wish anyone to be confused and I should be grateful if the 
	<i>Official Report</i> could be corrected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->

	<section>

	<div class='title'>INFORMATION ABOUT HOUSING REGISTER</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 408, in page 70, line 38, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>'other member of the public'</p></blockquote>
and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'person without the prior consent of the applicant'.</p></blockquote>
It is an important principle that information kept on housing registers, which is often sensitive for various reasons, should be exposed only to people who have a particular interest in having access to it. That must apply to the particular staff of an authority who administer the registration and allocation schemes. Such information should also be made available to those who are themselves registered. That is a fundamental principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that the wording of the clause could at the very least be open to misinterpretation. Under subsection (2), the information about the housing register, "shall not be divulged to any other member of the public".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is correct, in that it would exclude any members of the public other than the applicants from having information that is included on the register about the applicants. However, the provision implies that that information will be available to any other organisation or a member of an organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, the provision could imply that a social worker who was not involved in the registration scheme as such, but who worked for the authority that was responsible for the scheme, would have access to applicants' files. Would local authority councillors have access to applicants' files? Are members of Parliament counted members of the public or could they have automatic access to the register? Could people who work in Government Departments have access to it because they are not members of the public? It does not seem that any of those individuals would be refused access to it under the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>646</span>
Do the Government intend that any other member of the public should apply to civil servants acting in their official capacity for access to the information? We are worried that the wording of the provision could enable people in an official capacity, but who are not concerned directly with the registration scheme as such, to have access to it. That is why we have tabled the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second of our concerns is that certain members of the public should have access to the applicants' records because the applicants have given their approval. Applicants may be ill or elderly and may want some information, but may not be happy dealing with it by telephone or by writing a letter. They may prefer to sign a statement asking a neighbour to collect certain information from the housing department or make representations to it on their behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, it would be proper for neighbours or members of the family—acting on behalf of applicants—to discuss their cases with people in the local housing department. According to the provision, it seems that such people would be treated as any other member of the public and, thus, be excluded from having access to the information because no other member of the public in any capacity would have access to the information on the register in the applicant's name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, how could citizens advice bureau staff gain access to an applicant's record, even if the applicant's permission had been given? It seems that they could not, because they would not be officials of the local authority or persons acting on behalf of a recognised governmental body. I presume that they would be treated as members of the public, who would be excluded—or would they? Those questions show that the clause could be open to misinterpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the amendment makes it absolutely clear that the only people allowed access to information would be housing department staff involved with the registration scheme, the applicants themselves or people who had
	<br><blockquote><p>"the prior consent of the applicant".</p></blockquote>
That is right; it is clearer, and everyone would understand the intention. I hope that the Minister will explain what the clause means, and say whether he would accept a change of wording, to clarify precisely who should have access to what can sometimes be very confidential information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Gwilym Jones)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate much of what the hon. Gentlemen said, although when I first read the amendment I was not quite sure what he had in mind. I realised that one category would be people obtaining access to the register for commercial purposes—for instance, insurance or double glazing salesmen, who believed that the register might contain information to identify potential clients. None of us would want that to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not so readily follow the hon. Gentleman's argument when he used social workers as a example. I believe that there cold be distinct relevance in social service departments having an appropriate opportunity to know what was on the register. When dealing with vulnerable persons, that might be the best or even the only way to resolve possible confusion, which can arise all too often. For instance, access to the register would be valid if
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0368">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>647</span>
social service departments were considering drawing up a community care plan for the person involved. That may be more pertinent in Wales, where we have had complete local government reorganisation. One of the obvious benefits of having only unitary authorities is that social services departments and housing departments can work together more closely in the interests of and for the common good of those who need their help. Social services departments would clearly have a proper purpose in gaining access to the register, but it should be done properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was right to ask who would be excluded by the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"other member of the public",</p></blockquote>
and whether someone acting as an agent might be excluded. My understanding is that a person acting as an agent might have access. The hon. Gentleman raises an important question, which I should like to reflect upon further, to ensure that what he has in mind—a concept to which I would be favourably inclined—will be properly covered in the Bill. We are trying to ensure that commercial persons do not have access to the register, but that proper access is given, for instance, to social services departments formulating a community care plan. I suggest that we have used the right words. The amendment would stop something that should be allowed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for saying that he is prepared to consider allowing persons to act as agents. However, I am still a little uncertain about officials having rights of access to the register. For instance, it may be correct to allow access to the register for officials who are considering the housing needs of an applicant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there may be other council officials or officials of Government Departments who, even though they are not members of die public, should not have access to what can be confidential information. That information might include medical records, such as HIV status, which people might want recorded on the register because they believe it fundamental to their application for rehousing. It cannot be right to place no restriction on such information, so that it is available to anyone acting in an official capacity. It should be available only to officials who are directly concerned with applicants' housing-related needs. I hope that the Minister will consider that important issue as well as that of agents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly want to reassure the hon. Gentleman that I shall reflect further on what he has in mind. Our views are similar on the matter. There can be scope for proper opportunity for a social services department to use the information, but in no way should there be opportunity willy-nilly for anyone who might not be considered a member of the public to use it. The register should be operated properly. There is a requirement under the Children Act 1989 for co-operation in matters other than housing benefit—indeed, mat is a statutory duty. I take on board much of what the hon. Gentleman says, and I shall certainly reflect on it further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the Minister's assurances, 1 beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>

	<div class='title'>ALLOCATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALLOCATION SCHEME</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 351, in page 70, line 42, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'For this purpose "procedures" includes all aspects of the allocation process, including the persons or descriptions of persons by whom decisions are to be taken.'.</p></blockquote>
Applicant for council housing have every right to expect that their application will be treated fairly and objectively by the council and not on the basis of whom they know. Systems for allocating housing should be transparent and operated consistently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Wales, we have had a number of well-publicised local government ombudsman cases concerning member involvement in housing allocations. In some of those cases, I am sorry to say, the published allocation system of the council was found to be a sham and, for all practical purposes, the allocation was in the personal gift of the ward member. Like other Committee members, I want to be sure that such practices do not recur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I worry about claims of so-called local knowledge, which are used to justify active member involvement in individual allocation decisions. That can allow subjective judgments to override the objective assessment of need. Such practices can be a cover for prejudice and unfairness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>In Wales, we have already consulted—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There are an awful lot of conversations breaking out in the Room this morning. I am keen to hear the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have already consulted on the proposition that, under the powers of the clause, we should regulate member involvement in individual decisions on allocations and nominations. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales and I are now minded to bring forward such regulations for Wales. In England, that will be considered further with the responses to the consultation on regulations to be made under this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that what we propose for Wales fully recognises the proper role of councillors in setting and monitoring the allocations policy, in hearing appeals or in adjudicating special needs in other cases that do not fall squarely within the published scheme. Nor would there be anything to stop the relevant ward member from seeking information or making representations about particular cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the regulations will be widely welcomed by all those in Wales who are involved in housing. I also believe that they will be supported by most local authority members and housing professionals, who will especially welcome the fact that everyone will be required to adopt the good practices that they have long operated as a matter of course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 438, in page 71, leave out lines 1 to 4 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'The scheme shall be framed in accordance with the principle of giving reasonable preference to—

	<ol>

	<li>persons occupying insanitary or overcrowded houses;</li>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0369">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<li>persons with large families;</li>

	<li>persons with special housing needs; (i) persons with disabilities; and</li>

	<li>persons to whom the authority are subject to a duty under sections 149, 151, 155 and 158 of this Act.'.</li></ol></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 413, in page 71, line 3, leave out subsection (3) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(3) The Scheme shall give reasonable preference in allocations to persons who have specific housing needs relating to

	<ol>

	<li>physical disability or</li>

	<li>support or care requirements.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(3A) Subjects to any regulations made under subsection (2) and to subsection (3), the authority may decide on what principles the scheme to be framed.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to the core issue—priorities for allocation. The amendments define the categories of people who should be given reasonable preference in the allocation of council and other social housing. The Government accept that the main priorities for allocation must be defined in the Bill and propose to introduce on Report their own suggestions on how to frame the definitions. They justify that on the grounds that, as consultations on the priorities are taking place, it would be in appropriate for them to table amendments now because that would pre-empt the conclusions of the consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand that concern, although we can hardly fail to say that that arrangement does not reflect particularly well on the Government's forward planning; they are consulting at the very time when the Committee is considering housing allocation in detail. The normal convention is that a Committee should have full information on the effect of legislation so that it can debate all the implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we shall be generous to the Government. We accept that they are in some difficulty and that they are trying to remedy what is a fundamentally unworkable piece of legislation. They want to consult and come back with recommendations, and we shall not stand in their way. But we shall expect adequate time to be made available on Report to consider housing allocation and the many other matters that need to be debated because of the many undertakings that have been given in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the meantime, the Committee should debate the key criteria that should be included in a statutory definition of the categories of people to whom reasonable priority should be afforded in the allocation of social housing. In their consultation paper, the Government identified six categories of need to which local authorities should give
	<span class='label label-info column'>650</span>
reasonable preference. We have simply listed them in the amendments—they are the first six items—to show that there is no difference of opinion between the Government and ourselves, about those categories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The six categories are:
	<br><blockquote><p>"persons occupying insanitary or overcrowded houses; persons living under unsatisfactory housing conditions; people living in conditions of temporary or insecure tenure; families with dependent children or who are expecting a child; households containing someone with an identified need for settled accommodation; households with limited opportunities to secure settled accommodation."</p></blockquote>
However, other groups who face particularly acute housing problems, pressures and difficulties securing accommodation should also be afforded reasonable preference in any sensible allocation scheme. We have listed them also in the amendment. I shall deal with them in turn and say why they should be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first category is "persons with large families". That takes us back into history, and I am delighted that the right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South (Mr. Brooke) is here because his interest in history might well lead to an observation, if not now, later in the debate. As Ministers have said, the history of allocations goes back to the 1930s when, obviously, different circumstances applied. The listing of people with large families as one of the groups with priority needs reflected the concern at the extent of overcrowding and the fact that people living in insufferable conditions needed public housing. That was a perfectly reasonable priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government might argue that that is no longer so. I would challenge them on that because large families continue to have difficulties securing appropriate housing. In general, they wait longer to be allocated permanent housing because of the lack of available stock. There is a shortage of larger property for rent in all sectors. For example, there is a serious shortage of larger properties in the private rented sector. The vast majority of lettings that become available tend to be of smaller dwellings and it is known that landlords are reluctant to let to families with many children. The research that the Joseph Rowntree Foundation recently completed, which was published at the beginning of this week—Members received a timely briefing that enabled them to refer to it before this debate—highlighted the extent to which private landlords "least prefer" to let to households with children and to one or two other categories of people most likely to be homeless. So there is a problem for families with many children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the matter of cost. A family with several children will require larger accommodation and the price of that, certainly in the private rented sector, would be very high. That would have considerable implications for the family's ability to remain in employment if they became dependent on benefit, and for the public purse if it had to meet the high cost of privately rented accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Population projections suggest that there will be a continuing growth of smaller family units and single-person households, but in the absence of an adequate supply of suitable property for large families on low incomes, that group will have special difficulty in getting housing. For that reason it is entirely proper that such people should continue to be listed as one of the categories in need of reasonable preference in the allocation of housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What worries me is the question of supply. Will my hon. Friend press the Minister on the provision of four-bedroomed dwellings? My impression is that in many housing action schemes the number of four-bedroomed dwellings is being reduced, but the reduction is greater than the reduction in demand for such dwellings. There is a serious need for new four-bedroomed dwellings to be built in various parts of the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the view expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett). I cannot give him precise figures, but it is my experience that the financial constraints imposed by the current funding regime for housing associations make it extremely difficult for them to ensure the provision of larger accommodation. Such dwellings tend to be the exception, rather than the rule. Equally, when local authorities convert existing estates, they have to work within the physical limits of the structure of the buildings, and if it is simply not possible to extend properties to provide larger accommodation, that is another constraint preventing the provision of four-bedroomed or larger accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a significant number of large families, particularly among some of the ethnic minorities. I visited a scheme in Tower Hamlets last year with a small specialist housing association, the Labo housing association, which provides accommodation for families from the Asian community. It stressed to me the need for particularly large accommodation for some families in that community. Those are real needs, and all that my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish said and all the evidence that we receive suggests that families with several children should continue to receive reasonable preference—that is all we ask—in allocation schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second new category that we are proposing in addition to those that the Government propose is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"persons with special housing needs".</p></blockquote>
I shall deal with that along with the third category, "persons with disabilities", for two reasons—first because, in many respects, both categories have similar requirements, and secondly because amendment No. 413 with which amendment No. 438 is grouped, specifically refers to those two categories together—people who have needs because of physical disability or because of their support and care requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know about the importance of providing an adequate supply of good quality homes to make possible the sensitive implementation of the care in the community policy, and about the need to ensure that people with physical disabilities or with needs for support and care can be rehoused directly, rather than having to spend substantial periods in temporary accommodation.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification from the hon. Gentleman. The amendment refers to persons with special housing needs, but the hon. Gentleman is talking about people who need special

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to hear that the Minister might not be helpful; I had assumed that he would be. I shall clarify my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 438 and 413, use slightly different phraseology. Amendment No. 413 refers to persons with "support or care requirements" whereas amendment No. 438 refers to persons with "special housing needs". Because they are grouped together, I thought that it would assist the Committee if I considered them at the same time. However, I entirely accept that they cover a range of circumstances. Some people have special needs and require housing with additional services or care in addition to the house. Other people require special types of housing with adaptations, perhaps due to physical disability, which is covered in the next paragraph, or they might require a particular sort of house as a result of their background, history or circumstances, which do not come within the disability category. We are taking a broad view of people with special needs and people who will need accommodation that may, in some specific way, differ from mainstream housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last of the categories listed is persons who are owed a duty under clauses 149, 151, 155 and 158 of the Bill. It refers to homeless people who are subject to the various duties set out in the legislation. We believe that such people should be given reasonable preference in the allocation of housing. I stress, reasonable preference. It does not mean that they have an overriding priority; it just means that they should be entitled to consideration for rehousing along with the other groups of people who will be given reasonable preference. On the basis of common sense and logic, there should be no argument against that. Homelessness is, by any definition, an acute—probably the most acute—form of housing need. To suggest that people with other forms of housing need should be given reasonable preference, but that homeless people should not, flies in the face of all logic. Surely, there can be no justification for saying—I quote the Government's proposals-that people who are living
	<br><blockquote><p>"in temporary or insecure accommodation."</p></blockquote>
should be given reasonable preference whereas people who have no home at all—who are sleeping on the streets—should not. No reasonable person could possibly reach that conclusion. It defies all logic and common sense, but that is what is implied in the Bill and by the Government's proposed amendments to it set out in the consultation paper. Reasonable preference will be accorded to a variety of people facing a range of housing needs, but the homeless will not be included in that list. Not only is that a sin of omission—the Government have not forgotten about it—but it is the Government's deliberate decision to take the homeless out of existing legislation in which they are listed as one of the categories of people to whom authorities should give reasonable preference. Any fair-minded person must conclude that that is a nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How have the Government got themselves into this situation? The answer is their insistence on creating a single route into council housing. That is the basis of this part of the Bill. If everyone is assessed according to a single waiting list system—the Government's preferred
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0371">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>653</span>
option—homeless people cannot be included because, on any reasonable criteria, the homeless would be at the top of the list. They would have an automatic entitlement to housing, which would destroy the whole purpose of the single priority system. That is the logical nonsense at which the Government have arrived. That is at the bottom of their proposal that homeless people should not be assessed on waiting lists or treated on the basis of their homelessness, but should be given temporary accommodation and then assessed according to other criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to the Committee that that does not make sense. Even if it did, the concessions that the Government have recently made have undermined the case for proceeding in that way. I accept that the Minister has inherited the problem and is trying to mitigate it, but he will find it difficult—one cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. The Government's concessions seek to mitigate the blocks that would otherwise exist to prevent homeless people being considered for direct rehousing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has accepted that homeless people who have a high priority on the waiting list should be entitled to be rehoused directly without having to be housed in temporary accommodation first and then assessed. He has also accepted the principle that homeless people registered on the waiting list who have, to use his words, "nearly enough priority"—a concept that he has been curiously reluctant to amplify and explain—to qualify could also be rehoused directly rather than wait for a period in temporary accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also discussed children being discharged from care and Ministers have said that they will not legislate but will make regulations to enable children in care to be rehoused directly. We have also talked about a range of households with other special needs. In our debate on amendment No. 384, we considered the issue of local authorities having the discretion to rehouse homeless people directly without requiring them to spend a period in temporary accommodation. My understanding of the Minister's response is that he accepted that local authorities should have that flexibility to prevent homeless people having to be assessed on a waiting list while in temporary accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government seem to have accepted that the single waiting list system is no longer operative. The Minister has accepted that homeless people can be rehoused directly because of their homelessness. If he has accepted it, it is no longer sensible to continue with the fiction of a single route to accommodation, in which homelessness is not taken into account as a factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an even more serious implication, with respect to local authority's powers to allocation housing. If the Minister insists on proceeding with the removal of the homeless from the categories of people to whom local authorities are required to give reasonable preference in allocating housing, it is possible—I put it no higher—that some lawyers will interpret the provision as a fetter on local authority's powers to house homeless people directly. Otherwise, why would Parliament go through the process of removing the requirement of reasonable preference from statute? If that happens, we could be in the ridiculous position whereby it could be argued that a local authority did not have the power to house a homeless
	<span class='label label-info column'>654</span>
household because it was homeless, as there was no explicit requirement in the legislation to take account of homelessness and give reasonable preference to those who were homeless. We need to clarify the position on grounds of common sense, logic and consistency, and we need to avoid a possible legal nightmare, in which local authorities may be challenged for doing what the Committee has accepted should be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall not press the amendment to a Division. Like the Government, we accept that it is reasonable to wait for the consultation on the proposals to be completed—people should not feel that the consultation is a sham. However, I hope that the Minister will make it clear that he accepts the principles behind the amendments; that homeless people can be given reasonable preference because of their homelessness. If the Government persist with their original intentions, homeless people will be excluded from being given reasonable preference. That is the spirit in which we tabled the amendment, and we shall not press it to a Division, but it has an overwhelming force of common sense and logic, and I hope that the Minister will be able to respond positively and sympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Brooke 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of London and Westminster, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I deliberately did not intervene earlier, as I was following closely the hon. Gentleman's argument and did not want to interrupt his train of thought. I appreciate that he is ambivalent about regulations, although his original preference was that they should not exist, and that local authorities should interpret the provisions under amendment No. 438.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that the hon. Gentleman envisages a points system, under which the local authority would decide in which order to take the series of categories to which reasonable preference should be given. For example, paragraph (a) of the amendment refers to "overcrowded houses", and paragraph (g) concerns "persons with large families". Under the hon. Gentleman's proposal, will someone with a large family who is homeless and needs a significant amount of accommodation have preference over someone with a large family who is already in council accommodation? The homeless person would have more disadvantages, so would he come higher in the queue? There are many people in my constituency who would be disturbed if the ability of a large family to be rehoused were interrupted by the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take entirely the right hon. Gentleman's point. He will be aware that the amendment contains categories that overlap, so there would be circumstances in which people could qualify under several criteria. We do not propose that a simple additive formula, whereby people who tot up entitlements under perhaps three or four different criteria have greater priority than people who qualify under one criteria. We believe that that would be mechanistic and wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the clause should specify the circumstances in which local authorities should be prepared to give reasonable priority to people and that local authorities should have the flexibility to determine their allocation schemes and the appropriate degree of priority between different categories of need. There will be recommendations, guidance and good practice, and we believe that local authorities should have the discretion to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0372">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>655</span>
determine the precise detail of allocation within an overriding statutory framework that lists the categories to which reasonable priority should be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have always argued that it is not realistic to place homeless people into the same category as others, so that they are all assessed according to one waiting list. One cannot say to a homeless person, "You must wait on the street until your turn comes up in the queue and you have been measured against other people." There is an immediacy about physical homelessness that requires a more rapid response even than for people living in appalling housing conditions, who at least have a roof over their heads. That is not to say that greater priority should be given to them; it is simply that the nature of their crisis warrants a different speed of response. That is why we have always argued for two distinct and separate routes into social housing—a homelessness route and a waiting list route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish rightly highlighted the fact that the supposed conflict between those routes is the result of a shortage of allocations and housing to provide adequately for the needs of the homeless and of those who, like some of the constituents of the right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South, live in overcrowded and unsatisfactory conditions, who should also be given a high priority. The right hon. Gentleman should accept that if he goes down the same route as the Government, he will create an impossible situation. Some homeless applicants will apparently be entitled to be rehoused directly—the Minister said that they will be—but the authority, according to statute, will not be allowed to give them reasonable priority in the allocation of housing and could be challenged for doing so. That is intellectual nonsense and it must be remedied. The amendment seeks to ensure clarity. We hope that the Minister will give a positive and helpful response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I drew up my speaking notes on amendment No. 438, I anticipated that the hon. Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford) would not press it to a Division, but that he was simply exploring the possibilities. I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman accepts that we will table an amendment on Report, and I heard what he said about ensuring ample time for debate. It would not be right, therefore, to seek to pre-empt that consultation. To be logical, I must also say that it is not my intention to rule out what that consultation might result in, or to be unwilling to make changes or amendments. I shall outline the philosophy underlying the bill and comment on the hon. Gentleman's suggestions. However, I do not wish to give the impression that I seek to pre-empt the consultation, just as the hon. Gentleman sought not to pre-empt it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman spoke about factors that will form part of the consultation. For example, he spoke about large families. I know my family history; both my grandmothers were 14th children. My parents produced two children and I—I had better be careful; my wife and I have between us produced three. 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I did not want to be accused of sexism. I was not sure how I could have got it wrong, but I was sure that someone on the Opposition Benches wold find out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>656</span>
There has been an enormous contraction in family size over those two generations. That is not necessarily true in all communities. Whereas the traditionally large British family is much less common than it used to be, ethnic communities in parts of the United Kingdom have large families. The hon. Member for Greenwich did not mention that, but it is a circumstance which we must acknowledge. I do so, in order that we should not hedge around the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we have covered such elements in the criteria included in the Bill. I shall listen to representations in the light of the findings of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation report. I have referred on several occasions to the usefulness of those reports, and I have a high regard for the organisation that produces them. I shall take note also of the hon. Gentleman's explanation of special needs and the relationship between them. That was a useful clarification of the purpose of the amendments. When preparing a response, the text of an amendment must be used, and the purposes that underlie an amendment cannot always be gleaned from it. We would all wish to acknowledge that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would put the allocation criteria into the Bill, and it is intended to provoke debate. As I have said already, we will table an amendment on Report to put the allocation criteria into primary legislation. As the hon. Gentleman recognises, I must wait until I have gathered the fruit of the consultation process because it might lead the Government to adjust, refine or add to the criteria, which are litmus tests to find the underlying needs, as we all acknowledge. Had the hon. Gentleman wanted to press the amendment to a Division, the need to wait for the results of the consultation would have been the first reason that I would have given for not accepting it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would add new criteria to those that we propose. The six criteria on which we agree represent a significant movement from some of the earlier ideas that we floated within the housing world on how we might define the criteria. As the hon. Gentleman has acknowledged, they represent an attempt to add to the original criteria of the Housing Act 1935, which was essentially about physical conditions that reflected the prevailing circumstances of the day. The new criteria represent an attempt to deal with some of the more social characteristics that now underlie present day society which did not underlie society a generation or two ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we have included in the current proposals people occupying insanitary or overcrowded houses and people living under unsatisfactory housing conditions—the old 1930s criteria—but we have added people living in conditions of temporary or insecure tenure; families with dependent children or who are expecting a child; households containing someone who has an identified need for settled accommodation, for example, because he or she needs care; and people with limited opportunities to secure settled accommodation—perhaps because they do not have enough money. As I have said, the first two criteria come from section 22 of the Housing Act 1985, which took them from earlier legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new categories are significant because they increase the emphasis given to a household's underlying social and economic characteristics in the assessment of housing need. In other words, they are intended to reflect
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0373">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>657</span>
factors that are more relevant now, such as social need, family breakdown, divorce and abuse—the modern agenda of problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To those criteria, the hon. Gentleman wants to add people with large families, people with special housing needs, people with disabilities and homeless people as defined in various parts of the Bill. My initial reaction is that the first three of those groups are intended to be embraced by the earlier criteria that I have mentioned. In any case, we intend to spell out in the guidance, as is already spelt out in the consultation paper, the importance of those factors. So at present those additional groups are superfluous. However, if a case is made during the consultation process that those criteria represent factors that are not embraced by our proposals, I shall not close my mind to the possibility of examining those suggestions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be useful to make it clear that we expect local authorities to give very vulnerable people—they are not dealt with in the amendment—who might find it difficult ever to secure accommodation, higher priority than is expressed by the term "reasonable preference". As I have said, we intend to amend the Bill to that effect. Had the hon. Gentleman wanted to press the amendment to a Division, the fact that the additional groups that he suggested would be subsumed by the other six criteria would have been my second reason for caution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third reason for caution would be that, as the hon. Gentleman said, the amendment would specifically put homelessness among the allocation criteria. The fundamental purpose of the Bill is to identify the underlying needs of all those who require long-term social housing. We must try to identify the factors that give rise to those needs. The criteria on which we are consulting are an attempt to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is crucial to the purpose of the Bill to make a distinction between cause and symptom. Homelessness arises because of needs. I am trying to make the underlying needs the trigger for securing long-term social accommodation. Of course homelessness will be considered, in so far as those conditions reflect underlying needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe strongly, as I said previously, that in the hands of a reasonable, responsible local authority homeless people will be accommodated under the criteria that we are settling down. For many people there may be little difference in the route and the speed by which they move into permanent accommodation. There are, of course, provisions that set out the duty to care for people who face an overwhelming emergency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Greenwich gave a cautious interpretation of the amendment and the principle of "reasonable preference", but I am not entirely sure where he left us, in the light of his response to my right hon. Friend the Member for City of London and Westminster, South, and to what extent the principle constitutes a direct, autonomous route into housing. The hon. Gentleman's comments in response to my right hon. Friend's intervention gave me a different impression from that conveyed by his earlier remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our position is that we do not want to see homelessness as a means of securing direct priority access into housing—the homelessness route, as the hon. Gentleman called it. We should not regard homelessness as necessarily and universally requiring the provision of
	<span class='label label-info column'>658</span>
permanent social housing. Some people may be capable of recovering after an emergency and resuming an independent lifestyle. If the hon. Gentleman is pressing to reinstate homelessness as a direct route, that is incompatible with the central philosophy of this part of the Bill. That would be the third reason why I would recommend to the Committee that it should reject the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that the consultation period was open. We will listen to what people say in the consultation. The hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) is not sure whether to compliment me or reproach me for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will listen to what is said in the consultation process.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to what the Minister said about homeless families and their treatment as part of the overall allocation policy. Is she saying that homeless families who were given temporary accommodation by an authority under clause 151 would automatically be given preference under the condition restated in paragraph (c), of the amendment, which refers to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"people living in conditions of temporary or insecure tenure"?</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of that reference, which did not exist in the first drafts that we circulated around the housing world, was to make it clear that the circumstances of living in temporary accommodation, whether or not under the homelessness duty, would be one of the circumstances of insecurity that would count towards the underlying needs that themselves counted towards allocation. I shall listen to the consultation process but, for the moment, I have covered in broad terms the points made by the hon. Member for Greenwich—both of us have acknowledged that we are having a Second Reading debate, in a sense, about the principles behind the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Diana Maddock

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is absolutely right that we discuss such matters in Committee for two reasons. The Government must be permanently reminded of their proposals under the Bill and they must be reminded of the unsatisfactory way in which those matters have been handled. The hon.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0374">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>659</span>
White Paper, it is not satisfactory for part of a major part of the Bill to be out to consultation. We shall not have the results of that process until we debate the Bill on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not as generous as the hon. Member for Greenwich. A little smokescreen is being put up. Much fuss is coming not only from statutory groups, but from voluntary and church groups, about what the Government are doing. Most people involved in those organisations have worked at the front end of the matters that we are discussing for several years. No one but the Government wants such measures to be in place. I am pleased that the Minister will ensure that we have adequate time for discussion on Report. In the circumstances, that is the least that he can do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to finish what I am saying first. I have asked the Minister about consultation and he has been asked about it again this morning.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first point is that that is what the Committee stage is about.

I dislike the way in which many matters are handled, but I have yet to hear a satisfactory explanation from the Minister about allocation. He tried to give one, but it does not hold water. Nor does it hold water with the public. We must bring that home to the Government. As we have said time and time again in Committee, the real problem is that the Government will not face up to why we have to discuss to whom we should allocate the houses that are
	<span class='label label-info column'>660</span>
available. The reason is that there is a tremendous shortage of affordable housing. That is the root cause and the Minister has yet to face up to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is a little harsh on the Minister. He is making a tactical retreat and we should not draw attention to it; we should be kind to him. He is doing what we want but he cannot admit it, so we should have some sympathy for him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the consultation process and, having said nice things about the Minister, perhaps he will help me. I would like him to look at the schemes operating in Stockport, which has a hung council, and in thameside, which is a Labour-controlled authority, and in the part of my constituency covered by Manchester overspill. Will the Minister consider those three schemes in light of the consultation paper and write to me explaining why they should not be allowed to continue to operate as at present? For the years that I have represented Denton and Reddish and, before that, Stockport, North, the greatest problem that I have encountered has been with constituents who come to me with housing demands that bear no relation to what is available. It takes a long time for rules to become part of local folklore. The rules operated by the three authorities in my constituency are now well-embedded in local folklore, so people understand them. Unfortunately, people do not go to council officials for an explanation of the rules; they go to their cousins or to someone else in the locality. What upsets them more than anything else, when the rules have been explained to them in that custom-and-practice way, is when the council tells them that the rules do not operate in that way. If officials in Stockport, thameside or Manchester housing department have to say, "That is how we used to do it, but I am afraid that the Government have brought in new legislation and we now do it a different way", people will think that it is unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should direct their attention to the shortage of housing, not to the problem of allocation. The problem of allocation cannot be proved until we get rid of the shortage. As long as there is a shortage in the overall number of dwellings available, and in particular categories of dwellings, people will feel that the allocation system is unfair. Pressure will be put on the Government and stories will be told about feckless young mothers who jump the housing list. That group of people does not exist; it is one of the myths created by the Tory party. People do not get pregnant in order to jump the housing list, and the few who become pregnant for other reasons discover that they do not jump the housing list but end up in appalling conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need more dwellings, but I would also like the Minister to explain why existing schemes will not be allowed to continue to operate. Lack of local knowledge about such schemes is fundamental. In one case, an elderly person came to see me wanting to know why she had been top of the list for allocation to a bungalow in the north Reddish area for 12 months. She thought it was ridiculous that she was at the top of the list but had not been rehoused. Unfortunately, she did not know that there were only eight bungalows in that area. One had only to look at the electoral register to see that all eight bungalows had two residents. So it was unlikely that a vacancy would arise for a long time.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0375">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>661</span>
Changing the rules will not help to provide extra knowledge and information, as the council in Stockport has done by giving people a better idea of their likely chances of being allocated housing. The present system should continue to operate but with more information and more dwellings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should consider the issue of lifetime homes. We have seen the Government engaged in great activity. My hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich is more expert than I am, and I am sure that he could tell us when the building regulations were supposed to be amended—the consultation took place about 12 months ago, yet the Government still seem to be thinking about it.

I must be fair to him: since he has become a Minister, he has not stood on his head too many times and denied what he said originally. He has done one or two things quite well but he seems to be having great difficulty reaching a decision on the building regulations for lifetime homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment refers to special needs. It would be better to have far more dwellings built to lifetime homes standards so that if a person develops a disability, he will not have to move home. I want therefore to press the Government to do much more on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Building large dwellings is particularly difficult in respect of the grant available for housing associations. The tendency is to go for smaller dwellings. A smaller proportion of the population are having large families, but such people are finding it increasingly difficult to find suitable dwellings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand why councils believe that life would be difficult for people living in a road with 10 or IS four-bedroomed houses because the child population would be so high. I understand that that is why they may choose to cut down the number of such dwellings on a road. That is sensible provided that somewhere else in the housing stock is available to make up the shortfall. The Government have to address the problem of large dwellings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to summarise the main issues that the Government must consider. First, we need far more dwellings to be built—especially for disabled people at lifetime homes standards. Secondly, we need more larger dwellings. Why on earth do we need to change the regulations? Will the Minister explain why the three schemes that affect my constituents in Stockport, Manchester overspill at Haughton Green and Tameside need to be changed to come into line with the proposals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock). In an ideal world, the consultation should not have overlapped with the Committee's consideration of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask the Minister a specific question about consultation. I received the document "Allocation of Housing Accommodation by Local Authorities". On page 2 it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The paper invites comments on the Government's view of how these powers should be used in England."</p></blockquote>
It may have passed me by because a great amount of paper on housing issues has passed over my desk in the past few months, but will the Minister tell me what has happened in Wales? If it has passed me by, the consultation paper has possibly also passed by the organisations in Wales. That is particularly relevant given our earlier discussion on the level of consultation undertaken by the Department of the Environment on houses in multiple occupation compared with the level of consultation undertaken by the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) when he was Secretary of State for Wales. If the Minister can clarify that point, I will give way happily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A consultation paper has been issued in Wales and it is identical to the consultation paper in English with the sole exception that the word "Wales" replaces the word "England" and it is written both in English and Welsh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that explanation. I just wanted to know why the Minister sent me the one for England. In future, regional differences should be recognised: Welsh Members should receive the one intended for Wales. I am reassured by what the Minister said; I was not trying to trip him up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich, particularly about the additional classes of individuals who should be given reasonable preference. Paragraph (i) of amendment No. 438 lists "persons with disabilities". According to the Welsh Office housing statistics published in September 1993, 234 priority cases of housing need were accepted for physical disability and 232 priority cases were accepted for mental disability. Individuals with a mental or physical disability were accepted as priority housing cases by local authorities. The addition of paragraph (i) would at least give some recognition to those needs. If the clause is unamended, such individuals might slip through the net. That is not impossible, and I want to be reassured that persons with disabilities could be considered to have special housing needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year in Wales 10,293 households were accepted as being homeless. That does not necessarily mean that there is a problem with the allocation policy, but that there is a shortage of housing. I strongly support my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish in saying that we may be considering the problem the wrong way round. Although allocations are important, the main problem is the shortage of housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich spoke about persons with large families. In my constituency, the local authority has accepted several large families as having priority housing need. Large families are sometimes simply that—with six or seven children; sometimes they are the result of a remarriage, two smaller families being
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0376">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>663</span>
united into one; and sometimes, because one parent, perhaps the breadwinner, has died, the family may be living with relatives. My local authority has tried to solve the problem by allocating a proportion of four-bedroomed houses to large families and sometimes by knocking together two adjacent three-bedroomed houses. Amendment No. 438 would allow such imaginative solutions to continue. If paragraph (g)—"persons with large families"—is not included in the Bill, councils should still be able to take such action, legally and legitimately. If not, such families could find themselves continually in housing need and without the necessary support of the local authority. In my four years as a Member of Parliament, I have come across only three cases of large families looking to be rehoused. I should not want them to be refused because paragraph (g) was not included in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish is absolutely right. The Minister is beating something of a retreat. It is the Opposition's job to ensure that it is a successful retreat and that the Minister does not fall flat on his face while running backwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that paragraph (j) of amendment No. 438 was unnecessary and that local authorities should not have the specific responsibility to give even reasonable preference to people to whom they have a duty under the Bill's homelessness clauses. If the wording is not included, local authorities will not have a right under the Bill to give preference. Moreover, some clever lawyer will come up with an explanation to show that they cannot do so—because the relevant cases are not specified as something of which authorities must take account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I still believe that a duty for authorities to give reasonable preference to individuals to whom they have a duty under the Bill's homelessness provisions should be specifically included in the allocation policy. That does not mean that homeless families would be given automatic preference over everyone in the relevant categories—just that they would be given reasonable preference when considered alongside those categories. That would be the amendment's effect, and I am sorry that the Minister cannot even go as far as accepting it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to return to the question of how homeless families might be given some preference under other criteria. When I intervened on the Minister, he said, with regard to paragraph (c) in amendment No. 438, which concerns
	<br><blockquote><p>"people living in conditions of temporary or insecure tenure",</p></blockquote>
that where homeless people were housed in temporary accommodation under clause 151 it would be perfectly possible for authorities to give reasonable preference. An authority might even have a responsibility to do so, because of the temporary and insecure tenure. That response reassured me on one point. I had been concerned that, even with an extension of the review period to two years under clause 151, homeless families in temporary accommodation at the end of the two years might still be out on the streets. If authorities have a responsibility to give reasonable preference under paragraph (c) to people with temporary or insecure tenure, what I feared would appear to be less of a possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>664</span>
I am still unhappy that homeless people must undergo the process of being put in temporary accommodation before they can be considered for an allocation of secure tenure. That process and the disruption—more than once—of those people's lives will still be a fundamental problem, owing to the Minister's not including in the allocation criteria the group of people described in paragraph (j) of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister's views on another matter. Paragraph (b) in the amendment refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"persons living under unsatisfactory housing conditions".</p></blockquote>
Is it possible, in the Minister's interpretation, for an authority to come to a view that someone who is homeless has unsatisfactory housing conditions? Could a local authority decide mat, or does the paragraph refer only to someone who, for example, lives in a house that is unfit, or who, while needing ground floor accommodation, lives in a house with stairs? That issue could be raised at some stage. Could an authority rely on paragraph (b) to house someone who had no home? Will the Minister clarify whether, if that route could be used to house a homeless family without first putting them in temporary accommodation, clause 155—with its test of whether an authority has a duty to house anyone at all, depending on whether other accommodation is available in the area—would preclude the use of paragraph (b)? Alternatively, perhaps clause 155 would not impose a duty on an authority, but the authority could, if it chose, exercise a preference under a housing allocation scheme to house a homeless family directly under clause 128(b) without having to jump over the hurdle of clause 155. It is a complicated question, but it is relevant because local authorities must know where they stand when they have to decide how to operate their housing policies. I hope that the minister will respond on those points so that we can get a better feel about where we are moving on this crucial issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervened in the speech of the hon. Member for Greenwich on the subject of large families. I was grateful to him for his response and I should like to return briefly to the subject. Before doing so, I must comment on the speech of the hon. Member for Christchurch and, although he showed uncharacteristic asperity on Tuesday morning, a speech by the hon. member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts). If he looks at the first paragraph, he will know to what I am referring. Those speeches appeared to be exceptions to the measured mode in which this Committee has been conducted hitherto and which has seemed more likely to enable us to unravel various knots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Greenwich referred today to the Housing Act 1935 and the reference to large families. My late father was in the Conservative research department from 1929; I have no means of verifying it, but he may well have been a contributor. What is slightly more surprising—I was absent at Sir David Lightbown's memorial service when the hon. Gentleman referred to me on Tuesday morning—is that my father was appointed by Aneurin Bevan to chair various housing sub-committees and may therefore have indirectly contributed to the National Assistance Act 1948, to which the hon. Gentleman referred on Tuesday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is not being pressed today, but clearly we have slightly more time now than we shall have on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0377">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>665</span>
Report. I want to raise one question for subsequent correspondence with the Minister, not for answer today. The issue of large families and the accommodation available for them has clearly been determined by the demography of the past, which has since underlain the planning of accommodation. Although I have some a priori evidence on the strength of my constituency, I do not know whether the ethnic minorities referred to by the hon. Member for Greenwich and possibly also by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish—my remarks are essentially descriptive and not evaluative—have changed the pattern of demography. Allowing for the fact that the fertility of the Minister's grandparents or great-grandparents has also been removed from the equation in the past SO years, I should like to ask my hon. Friend if there has been any academic research into whether the pattern of demography has been altered in terms of the provision of accommodation for large families? I should be entirely content if he chose to write to me about that. I do not seek an answer today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned about the references that the Minister made—in his response to my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich—to the fact that we are having further consultation about this issue. The housing manager of Wakefield housing authority has drawn my attention to the fact that, in 1994, the Government published a consultation paper on "Access to Local Authority and Housing Association Tenancies". It would appear that the Department was looking for information on that issue more than two years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also reminded that, arising out of that consultation paper or immediately after it, the Government announced in July 1994 their intention to introduce a housing Bill as soon as parliamentary time in the 1995–96 session allowed—that is the Bill before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A full consultation exercise was carried out prior to the Bill and gave rise to some of the clauses in it. An Association of Metropolitan Authorities document supplied to me by Kevin Dodd, the manager of housing in Wakefield, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the Consultation Paper the Government proposes to:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>end the duty of local housing authorities to secure permanent accommodation for homeless people;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>take powers to require local authorities to allocate all housing from a single waiting list, and to prescribe who may appear on the list and who will receive priority;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>promote the private rented sector for housing homeless people."</p></blockquote>
So all the issues to which the Minister referred today were covered by the consultation paper in January 1994. The local authority associations, authorities of every political persuasion and other interested bodies such as Shelter, the Chartered Institute of Housing and many tenants organisations responded to the consultation paper, giving their views on the problems that they envisaged if the Government continued with the proposals that we are considering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was why I intervened in the Minister's speech and asked what he was looking for in the subsequent consultation. If he goes back into the archives, he will find that all the organisations that have some interest and involvement in housing management and allocation have expressed their concerns about the proposals in the Bill. Some of the amendments that we have tabled arose from information obtained during the consultation process in January 1994.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>666</span>
One must ask whether the Minister is trying to delay matters by further consultation. When he gets its results, what will he do? Will there be another consultation exercise? Following the 1994 consultation, another one is taking place two years later, and there is no guarantee from the Minister that when he receives the latest results, the matter will be resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be dealing with the problems that were revealed by earlier consultations. It must be frustrating for the people who spent a great deal of time advising the Minister on issues such as homelessness, the single list of applications and criteria for determining housing priorities, to hear the Minister say that he is looking for more information. We are witnessing a delay in tackling the anomalies that arise from the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised by Mr. Dodd of Wakefield that both the Association of District Councils and the Association of Metropolitan Authorities and other bodies interested in housing have made it clear to the Minister that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The current duties of local authorities provide an important safety net for homeless people and should not be removed unnecessarily".</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister take note of that point and give an assurance that he will not remove existing local government procedures for safeguarding homeless people?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document adds:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Government has underestimated the degree of discretion available to authorities under current legislation, which is sufficient to ensure that allocations can be fairly distributed between homeless and other applicants".</p></blockquote>
In other words, there is more than one list and people will be looked at in accordance with the need of the applicant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the Minister looking for? If such discretion is available to local authorities and if they are practising it, why cannot we make progress this morning? We cannot do so because the Minister has issued a further consultation paper. All through our proceedings, we seem to have been deferring issues, withdrawing clauses and issuing consultation papers. The hon. Gentleman promises to write to members of the Committee and to let us know of his thinking. His colleagues say that they do not need such information now and that he can write to them about it. What is the Bill about? I thought that we would be making progress with housing matters, but all we have done is to create further delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be considering what has happened in the past. Members of local authorities have considered previous consultation documents and have put their local knowledge to the fore. We have access to local information about how organisations see the way in which housing is allocated and how the approval of priority cases is gained. In many instances, the public are highly satisfied with the work of the local authority housing departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to press the Minister again. He said that he has issued the consultation document, but I assume that it is not asking any further or different questions from those that were being asked in January 1994.1 want assurances that he will not frustrate the position of people who are now responsible for housing and for making recommendations on the fairness of housing allocation. Without some assurances, all we are doing is creating a further delay.

	<span class='label label-info column'>667</span>
A letter from the Wakefield housing department reminded me that the underlying factor is the supply of affordable social housing. I could see some benefit in the Minister sending out a consultation paper asking the views of local authorities and housing associations about the supply of social affordable housing, but nowhere in the consultation paper has the hon. Gentleman asked that question. Let us be honest. Let us have some fair answers. Let us stop issuing consultation papers and make some progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Northfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall detain the Committee for only a short time. I cannot blame the Minister for previous consultations that have not been acted on, perhaps if he had been around before, he would have responded to them. Who knows? Let us hope that he will respond positively to the forthcoming consultations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The points that have been made by Opposition Members today will no doubt be made during the consultation process. I hope that that will reveal to the Minister that, in considering a single allocation system he will have to take into account the examples that we have cited, such as special needs, disability and homelessness. What would he do if, on reflection, he decided that the idea of a single allocation system was flawed in the first place? I am not asking him to say today that he will come to that view, because he may not. But if that view is put to him and he is convinced that a single route on allocation is not workable, is it theoretically possible for the Minister to say on Report that he will reconsider the single allocations system? It is important that people know that because if the consultation is to be real consultation, it should take views on how to allocate housing. It should not be a question of the Government saying, "We have decided part of the answer in advance, and we shall now consult on the rest." If the Minister became convinced of its flaws, could he—and would he—reconsider the idea of a single system, as well as its operation, on Report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a good and far-reaching debate. Extremely useful contributions have been made by my hon. Friends the Members for Denton and Reddish, for Attercliffe, for Delyn (Mr. Hanson), for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Burden) and for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien). The hon. Member for Christchurch also made a useful contribution, even though she offended the right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South by a touch of asperity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman made one of his characteristically delightful contributions to the Committee, reminding us of his family history. In response to what he said, I hope that a future Labour Government may be able to draw on his talents in the way that the late Aneurin Bevan drew on his father's talents in the late 1940s. I only hope that, because of his father's involvement in the 1940s, the right hon. Gentleman will not feel too attached to the framework of the National Assistance Act 1948, which put the emphasis on temporary accommodation for the homeless. We believe that homeless people should be secured permanent accommodation. That was the correct response in 1977, and we believe that that framework should be retained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>668</span>
We have some very strong allies in that respect. My attention was drawn this morning to an article, which appeared in 
	<i>Local Government News,</i> by the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath). The right hon. Gentleman sets out a characteristically forceful case under the heading, "Housing need, not dogma" for the provision of permanent accommodation for homeless people. He talks about the increase in the number of homeless people and goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nearly 40 percent of such people are housed in temporary accommodation, a practice which is not only expensive, but also in breach of the current statutory obligation of local authorities to provide permanent accommodation for homeless people's needs.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Housing policy should be founded on the demonstration of basic human needs and not on dogma."</p></blockquote>
I agree wholeheartedly, and I hope that some of the Conservative members of the Committee will also recognise the right hon. Gentlemen's wisdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister indicated that the first three criteria outlined in our amendment, which are additional to those proposed by the Government, were likely to be covered by existing provisions. I put it to the Minister that we would not have tabled the amendment had we been satisfied that that was the case. I hope, therefore, that he will give further thought to the issue, because the six criteria proposed by the Government are very broad and could be interpreted in a range of different ways. We are far from satisfied that the needs of large families will be met. I am delighted to know, incidentally, that the Minister is not generating large families, unlike his grandparents. Large families have real needs which have been highlighted by other members of the Committee. They should be given priority, as should people with special housing needs and those with disabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seemed to be unclear about our position. Therefore, I shall put it on the record without ambiguity so that there can be no doubt. We reject the Government's view that there should be a single route into local authority and other social housing. A single route will not work, for the reasons that we have stated. There has always been a variety of different routes, and that should continue to be the case. There should be a waiting list route, a special quota route for certain categories of people with special needs who need to be rehoused directly without being placed on a waiting list and a homeless route. As we have said, children leaving care represent one such group, but there are many others. Any sensible, practical housing policy must take account of that range of different needs, and must ensure that homeless people are rehoused directly and are not required to spend time in temporary accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's response to our suggestion that there should be a homeless category was neither adequate nor logical. His response was based on two propositions, the first of which was that the homeless would be considered as part of the "underlying needs" category. In other words, their needs would be dealt with under the other criteria. However, that is not clear; the criteria are broad. There could be ambiguity because the Government propose to remove the homeless from the existing list, and anyone interpreting the legislation will assume that there is a purpose behind that. If homeless people can be accommodated under other criteria, what is the harm of including homeless people under the clause?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's second proposition was that the homeless should not have automatic entitlement to permanent social housing. However, we do not argue that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0379">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>669</span>
they should. We are arguing not that there should be an automatic entitlement for every homeless person to be given permanent council housing ahead of everyone else, but that homeless people should be allocated permanent rather than temporary accommodation wherever possible. That is right and proper. We recognise the need for a pluralist framework in which there will be different routes into housing. People with other categories of need on the waiting list should have an opportunity to be housed, as well as those coming through the homelessness route. There should be a route for homeless people; their needs should be recognised and they should be able to be given permanent accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has accepted that some categories of homeless applicants will be rehoused directly. He has accepted that people on waiting lists with a sufficiently high level of points will be rehoused directly, but we have had no clarification of that matter. The Minister is being somewhat evasive, but he has said that that is possible. How can local authorities be confident that they are acting lawfully and that they will not be challenged if they cannot give reasonable preference to homeless applicants under the terms of the legislation? The Minister proposes to remove from legislation the provision that states that local authorities should give reasonable preference to homeless applicants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the scenario of a homeless applicant who is on the waiting list, but whose points level is insufficient for him to be rehoused directly. However, the local authority considers that the applicant's points level is nearly close enough for him to be rehoused. Taking the Minister's guidance, the authority decides to offer direct rehousing to the applicant, but someone else on the waiting list—who has a higher level of points, but who is not homeless—challenges the authority, saying, "Why have you rehoused that homeless applicant ahead of me when I have more points on the waiting list?" How can the local authority justify its decision? It cannot say that, under the Bill, it must give reasonable preference to people who are homeless and, therefore, it must give the homeless applicant a house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is creating a framework in which local authorities could find themselves in the High Court facing judicial review of their decisions, or even facing charges of acting ultra vires, a possibility that I raised earlier. It is not a sensible change. There is no problem; the Minister accepts that homeless people will, in certain circumstances, be rehoused directly. Why cannot he accept that the legislation should state, as it does now, that local authorities can and should give a degree of reasonable priority or preference to homeless people? Everyone knows that it makes sense. The right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup knows that it makes sense. Churches, housing authorities and other housing organisations know that it makes sense. The Government are arguing the impossible in trying to defend those changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most endearing qualities of the Minister is his reluctance to defend the indefensible—and, indeed, his reluctance to waffle inconsequentially if he does not have an answer. We can always tell when the Minister is in trouble, because he adopts an almost trappist silence. However, silence will not be enough this morning. There is a clear, logical, legal problem in what he proposes.
	<span class='label label-info column'>670</span>
It will not do. It will not wash. We must be given a clear indication of how the Government want to proceed. If the Minister is sensible, if he lives up to his own instincts, which are broadly right, and if he does not allow himself to be swayed too much by his awful inheritance—the unworkable policy that he has been asked to put into effect—he will recognise the force of our arguments. He will recognise the need to ensure that local authorities should still be allowed to give reasonable preference to homeless applicants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If it will help the hon. Member for Greenwich, I shall seek information from the Housing Corporation about the number of larger houses that feature in the current programme.

That will be one of the major debates of the next generation. I shall seek information on the breakdown of the various types of household.

The criterion relating to people in temporary accommodation exists to embrace both those who are in temporary accommodation under the council's homelessness duty and those who are not. That is a small measure of reassurance for the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On unsatisfactory housing conditions, there is SO years of case law on what it means. I shall write to my right hon. Friend the Member for City of London and Westminster, South, who asked what research was available relating to large families and their implications for settlement patterns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton made a plea against consultation. Given the number of amendments tabled by the Opposition requiring more consultation, I find that a refreshing change of tack. We have not consulted on this matter before. Previous exercises did not consider the detailed arrangements. I am afraid that almost eternal consultation is a fate of government because delegated legislation is almost inevitably preceded by consultation on detailed matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Northfield was anxious that I should take notice of the consultation. We have eternal consultations so that we can take notice of them, and I shall consider the responses. If the hon. Gentleman considers the Bill as it is now, and compares it with the Bill as originally conceived, he will see that people have taken notice of consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The specific point that I asked the Minister was not just whether he would take notice of the consultation. It was that if the consultation questioned the basis of a single route to housing allocation, would he take notice of that and be prepared to change it, if he was convinced by the argument?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his article, which I have not yet seen, my right hon. Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup apparently says that he wishes housing policy to be founded on need. In that sense, we absolutely agree with him, and I am glad to have his support in the matter. We shall have occasion to debate those matters again when we consider homelessness next week, so I shall not rehearse ground that we have already covered. We want to set out clear criteria that identify people's underlying needs so that we
	<span class='label label-info column'>672</span>
can respond to them with the offer of permanent accommodation, but we must first assess those needs, and emergency provision must be available so that the assessment can take place while people are in secure—secure in the sense of safe—accommodation. That is the purpose of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a divide between ourselves and the Opposition on the matter of a single route into housing, but it has been useful to specify that. As in many of our debates, there are many issues on which there is no divide in principle. In some ways, we are seeking to do the same thing, but neither side is satisfied that the other can deliver that. That is true of this debate, but it has been a useful introduction. It has clarified our views, enabled us to identify some common ground, and enabled me to spell out the purposes of the consultation and my intention that it will be a substantive exercise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move the amendment No. 412, in page 71, line 2, at end insert 'and shall include the principle that the scheme shall not discriminate on the basis of marital status.'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment covers an area where there is a discrepancy between the views expressed in the White Paper—and, I suspect, by some of the Minster's colleagues—and the views expressed by the Minister himself. The purpose of our amendment is to ensure that that lack of clarity is resolved in a way that accords entirely with the views expressed by the Minister, so I hope that he will have no difficulty in accepting the amendment. It says that the allocation scheme
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall not discriminate on the basis of marital status."</p></blockquote>
The Minister has made it clear that he is not interested in a moralising agenda, but that he is concerned about meeting housing needs. Unfortunately, that is not consistent with the views of others in his party, nor is it entirely consistent with the White Paper, which, I remind the Minister, stated that allocation schemes
	<br><blockquote><p>"should balance specific housing needs against the need to support married couples who take a responsible approach to family life".</p></blockquote>
There is a straightforward conflict between the Minister's stated views and the comments in the White Paper. The amendment seeks to ensure that that lack of clarity is removed, so that it is made clear that allocation should be about need rather than morality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have received helpful and detailed briefings from many bodies on the matter, and I want to refer particularly to that from the Churches National Housing Coalition, which makes the point with force. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Whilst churches have a long historic concern for marriage and family life, they strongly believe that social housing should be allocated on the basis of need and not marital status".</p></blockquote>
Churches will not support
	<br><blockquote><p>"such implied discrimination between those 'deserving'"</p></blockquote>
and those less deserving
	<br><blockquote><p>"of access to social housing, particularly where it would have a damaging impact on children".</p></blockquote>
The briefing continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Christian understandings of social responsibility and morality require equal treatment and concern for those groups in society who are most marginalised—including in this case one parent families
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0381">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>673</span>
(the vast majority of which are the result of relationship breakdown rather than young … mothers who have never been in a stable relationship)."</p></blockquote>
I trust that the Minister will accept the amendment. It is in line with his stated views and his instincts, which, we hope, will prevail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is a bald statement of the requirement on a local authority, and no moral implications can be drawn from it. If the hon. Member for Greenwich inserts the statement contained in the amendment into the clause, he will introduce a moral principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we want the clause to be morally—neutral I shall not debate whether that is right or wrong—we should either include every contingency that we can conceivably think of or leave the clause as bald as it stands. I can see no reason why we would add a particular set of criteria referring to one sort of legal status rather than any other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document "Fair and seen to be fair", which was produced by the local authority associations in 1995, said that a number of local authorities of all persuasions—this is a cross-party matter—identified the status of being newly-married as one of the needs criteria that they commonly used in allocation schemes. Given our concerns about the social framework, I do not want to tell local authorities that they may not do that. Leaving the clause as it is will be the best way to avoid arguments about behaviour and morality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is all very well for the Minister to say that the Bill is morally neutral, but that is not true of its genesis. Much of the publicity before the consultation—it was issued at particular events at the seaside at the end of September and in early October—was precisely about making moral judgments and scapegoating victims of homelessness. Many of us suspect that that was not just because the Conservative party fancied making scapegoats but because it wanted to deflect attention from the issue that Labour Members have put forward time and time again: the shortage of affordable housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a consequence to that. The Bill must make it clear that it is not discriminatory and does not advocate discrimination in housing allocation, because many people have that impression, and that was the implication of several intemperate speeches that have been made outside this place by people with responsibility who should have known better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich, I recommend the Minister to read what churches have said on the matter. They have been absolutely clear that the idea that there should be a moral imperative to raise people who are married above people who are not married in terms of housing need is out of order. The Catholic Housing Aid Society's document, "No Homes—What Future?", specifically addresses the myth that women get pregnant and then become homeless in order to find a quick route into housing. Having successfully knocked down that myth, the document says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We believe that it is support, not punishment, that needs to be given those young parents who are lacking accommodation."</p></blockquote>
That is certainly what Labour Members feel, and the Minister needs to take that on board. If the background to the Bill had been different, the amendment might not have been necessary, but we cannot change what has been said or implications that have been drawn from the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>674</span>
A week or so ago, the Committee had the good sense to make it absolutely clear, by writing it into the Bill, that there should not be discrimination against same-sex couples in the succession of tenancies. By the same logic, the Committee should write into the Bill a stipulation that there should not be discrimination against either unmarried couples or parents who live on their own with their children. If the Bill is about housing need, including that stipulation in it should not be a problem. That would not be inserting any kind of moralism—as the Minister implied. It would avoid moralism. I hope that the Minister will reconsider the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to press the amendment, but, in order to spare the Minister the embarrassment of having to vote against the views that he has expressed in public, and in the hope that he will come to see the merit of our argument, and to allow time to consider other important issues, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 417, in page 71, line 4, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(3A) Before adopting or varying a scheme, a local authority shall make such arrangements as it considers appropriate for its secure tenants to be consulted on the proposed scheme.'.</p></blockquote>
Again, the amendment concerns consultation. It is right that if an authority is to adopt or change a scheme, it should consult "its secure tenants". Perhaps the Minister will say that section 105 of the Housing Act 1985, which relates to consultation on housing management issues and changes of management, already covers allocation. However, in the Ealing court case, matters relating to the collection of information on housing need as part of an allocation policy were deemed not to be chargeable to the housing revenue account, and therefore not part of what might normally be considered housing management. That throws doubt on whether the term housing management, as used in section 105 of the 1985 Act, covers allocation procedures. The amendment is an attempt to explore what advice the Minister has received on that. Will he confirm whether allocation procedures are already covered?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the amendment relates only to secure tenants, perhaps there ought to be an arrangement whereby local authorities are obliged to consult not only secure tenants—who, by their nature, may be interested in a transfer to another property—but people who are on the local authority's register and will at some stage be offered a council property. Section 105 of the 1985 Act certainly does not cover them or any consultation with them, yet they will have a direct interest in any allocation policy that is formed and in any future changes to that policy. I look forward to the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has anticipated part of my remarks. I assured the Committee when we considered clause 91 in part V of the Bill that amendment No. 283 was unnecessary because section 105 of the 1985 Act required local authorities to consult their tenants on matters of housing management and in particular on changes in their housing management practice and policy. That provision is not touched by anything in the Bill, so I think that amendment No. 417 is unnecessary.

This is a commonsense amendment and I hope that the Minister will accept it. It seeks to ensure that local authorities maintain lists of properties in their stock that are particularly designed or adapted for disabled people. The purpose is self-evident—to ensure that authorities know what properties are available to meet the needs of the disabled and to make them better able to respond to those needs as and when disabled people apply for accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Research has highlighted the extent to which local authority information on that score is patchy. Some authorities have comprehensive records, but others do not.

	<br><blockquote><p>'(4) In this section "publish" means producing information in the preferred reading medium of a member of the public.'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment is intended to ensure that information published on allocation procedures is published in the preferred reading medium of members of the public. It is designed to ensure in particular that people who are blind should not be disadvantaged because information is available only in written form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not proposing that the information should be required to be provided in any one form. Authorities should establish locally what are the preferred reading mediums of local residents.

It is a commonsense amendment.

As the Bill stands, the Government would have no duty to consult local authorities about changes.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause relates to offences that may be committed by individuals who knowingly or recklessly make false statements as part of their applications for housing. The amendments seek to do two things. First, they would provide mitigating circumstances when an applicant provides false information, but has a
	<span class='label label-info column'>678</span>
reasonable excuse for doing so. Secondly, they would reduce the level of fine to which applicants would be liable if they were found guilty of such an offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly explain the reasons for the amendments. People may sometimes give a false statement as part of an application not out of wickedness or malice, but simply out of fear or because they do not want to admit to something that is highly embarrassing. For example, people who apply for housing because a child is being abused may not want to speak about that and may give another reason for the application. Similarly, people who flee accommodation because they fear violence from another person living there, may genuinely fear harassment, victimisation or intimidation and may, for whatever reason, choose not to provide the full story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard of people who are too frightened to give evidence against those who have caused misery to many residents on estates. People who are terrified of such intimidation may have good grounds for withholding information, but they would technically be committing an offence under the Bill as it is drafted. For those reasons, the Bill should contain a safety net. If people have a reasonable excuse for withholding information or providing false information, they should not be found guilty of an offence. That is a simple matter of common sense and justice. I hope that the principle will be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 425 would reduce the level of a fine from scale 5 to scale 3. Earlier, we considered the activities of certain slum landlords running multi-occupied houses. Both sides of the Committee agreed that the behaviour of such people is reprehensible beyond belief and we took measures to provide penalties when they behave in that way. Such landlords will be liable to fines up to scale 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a problem of proportionality if an unfortunate applicant for housing—who may, for whatever reason, have provided a false statement and be convicted of an offence—is liable to the same level of penalty as a slum landlord who has profited from cramming many people into squalid, dangerous and unsafe accommodation. Such landlords make large sums of money out of the misfortune of others and off the back of the public purse. The two offences that I have described are of quite different scales. Reducing the fine for providing false information from scale 5 to scale 3 is not to say that such an offence is somehow foregiveable. We accept that those who make false statements knowingly, recklessly and without good excuse should be fined, but we do not accept that the fine should be scale 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will agree to reducing the level of fine. If he does, I hope that he will accept the amendment. He would find it hard to suggest that its wording is defective; it simply changes 5 to 3. If we are lucky, it might be another Opposition amendment that receives the Minister's assent. I hope that it will be and I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is in headlong retreat. Two weeks ago, he was proposing to erect gallows in the middle of council estates for people who had committed anti-social behaviour. Now, he is desperate to dilute some of the fines and penalties. The Committee needs to be tough on amendments and tough on the causes of amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0384">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>679</span>
It is difficult to imagine how one can have a reasonable excuse for making a statement that is knowingly or recklessly false. The hon. Gentleman gave examples, Withholding information is not the same as knowingly making a false statement. We expect people to make that distinction. I shall ensure that that is clarified when we explain the purpose of the clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the amount of fine, the hon. Gentleman knows that a standard level is applied for many types of offence. I will reconsider that. I shall have to consult, because the implications run across a much wider range of offences than those for housing matters. I make no promise other than that I will examine the hon. Gentleman's point about proportionality and the relativities of other types of offence. If he accepts that assurance, I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Minister a little further? Under the clause as drafted, it is an offence if a person either
	<br><blockquote><p>"knowingly or recklessly makes a statement"</p></blockquote>
or
	<br><blockquote><p>"knowingly withholds information".</p></blockquote>
The Minister accepts that there is a difference. But the offence exists equally if either applies, as does the penalty. The Bill does not make a distinction. I hope that he will come back to us on that and if he recognises our point that withholding information on any ground that I have described may be excusable—we argue strongly that in the circumstances that we mentioned it would be—we hope that he will agree that it would be reasonable and proper to distinguish between them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. James Clappison)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman read out the first part of clause 132(1)(b) relating to a person committing an offence if
	<br><blockquote><p>"he knowingly withholds information which the authority have reasonably required him to give in connection with the exercise of those functions."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cite my earlier example of a person who has fled from violence and withholds information about his reason for leaving because he is frightened of intimidation. The authority could construe that it was reasonable to ask the person why he had left his home. If he withheld that information, he would, in my view, be guilty of an offence. There is a real problem here. There would be circumstances in which someone was not doing anything wicked but merely trying to protect his emotions, for example. The case of an abused child is another obvious example. The Minister should think further and harder about this and be more flexible. The provision is a blunt instrument that could penalise people who acted in good faith, having very good reasons for withholding information. Such people should not be rendered guilty of an offence, but that is a risk as the clause is drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of the ground that concerns the hon. Gentleman is covered by section 74 of the Housing Act 1985. However, I shall look at some of the points he has raised, as he requested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>REGULATIONS</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 426, in page 71, line 37, leave out from 'instrument' to end of line 40 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(2) No such regulations shall be made unless a draft thereof has been approved by resolution of each House of Parliament.'.</p></blockquote>
This is a straightforward amendment. There are an enormous number of regulation-making powers in this part of the Bill. The amendment would provide that regulations did not become effective unless a draft had been approved by resolution of each House of Parliament. It is a matter of the positive rather than the negative procedure. Give the number, and importance, of the regulations I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is proof positive that the Labour party does not expect to be in government. I can imagine the hon. Gentleman turning up as Secretary of State for the Environment, or housing Minister, with all his regulations, and his business managers asking him, "What on earth did you get us into this for?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are bound to be lots of regulations. In truth, the present procedure is perfectly sensible. I have already said that in matters of special importance the affirmative procedure should be used. I do not think that these matters come into that category. Therefore, in my own interests and those of any successor, I must reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made an interesting and plausible case on pragmatic grounds. We, however, prefer to stand on principle. I remind the Minister that he as written page after page to us itemising regulations that he proposes to make under powers contained in the Bill. The scale of regulation-making powers in the Bill is extraordinary. We require a more thoughtful response from him than his simply saying in pragmatic terms, "We do not want to have to go through the troublesome process of presenting all that to Parliament." That is not right and, in the interests of open government, positive procedures should be used. If the Minister will not concede the amendment, I invite my hon. Friends to vote for it</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
