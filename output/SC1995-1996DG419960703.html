	<div class='title'>Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Argentina) Order 1996</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Michael Jack)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Argentina) Order 1996.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Mongolia) Order 1996 and the Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Venezuela) Order 1996.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was sorry to hear that the hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien), who was to have taken the order through for the Opposition, cannot be with us, due to indisposition. We send him our best wishes for a speedy recovery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to introduce the orders. The United Kingdom is a world leader in double tax agreements—DTAs—with a network of around 100 bilateral tax treaties. Double tax agreements give relief from the burden of international double taxation that would otherwise result when income arises in one country, is paid to a resident of another country and is taxable in both. Like many other countries, we take as our starting point the OECD model. That is a standard form of agreement, continually developed over the years by tax experts from many countries, including the UK, pooling their knowledge, experience and best practice. The purpose of the model is to lay down consistent rules that allocate taxing rights bilaterally between countries for different kinds of income and profits according to their nature, and to do so in a way that is both rational and familiar to business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those rules govern the taxation of income flowing between the two treaty partners and fix the maximum rates of tax that may be applied to certain categories of income by the country in which the income arises—rates that will remain unaffected by any subsequent increase in domestic tax rates in either country. Where income would otherwise be doubly taxed, such agreements also provide for one country to recognise and give relief for tax paid to the other, by giving credit against its own tax or by exempting the income altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Double taxation agreements are therefore welcomed by the business community. They are good for business
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
because they reduce tax-related barriers to international trade and investment and provide certainty of treatment by reducing withholding tax on investment flows, preventing double taxation by allocating taxing rights, and providing a mechanism for tax authorities to resolve problems of double taxation in difficult cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Double taxation agreements also have advantages for the Exchequer. They help combat tax avoidance and evasion by providing for the exchange of information between the tax authorities of the partner countries and limit the foreign tax that would otherwise be paid in the absence of a treaty for which the UK would have to give relief. British business attaches great importance to the development of a network of double taxation treaties in Latin America, an area of marked potential. To date, we have concluded four comprehensive agreements with Latin American countries, two of which—those with Argentina and Venezuela—are before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Argentina is now our third most important export market in Latin America. British investment in Argentina is currently £383 million—double the 1991 level. Several major British companies have made substantial investments in Argentina's wide-ranging privatisation programme. Argentina is also planning several significant infrastructure projects, for example the Colonia bridge, spanning the Rio de la Plata, and the Corpus Christi hydro electric dam to be built on the Parana river. Those and similar projects will undoubtedly offer opportunities for British industry. The double taxation convention, which was signed by my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor in January, will play an important role in encouraging mutual trade and investment. It strikes a fair balance between Argentinian and British interests and also signals to the world the increasing warmth of our bilateral relations with Argentina.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Venezuela is our fourth largest market in Latin America. The UK has a 6 per cent. share of total foreign investment in the country—a total exceeded only by the USA and the Netherlands. An investment promotion and protection agreement was signed earlier this year, which together with the double taxation convention will enable British companies to participate with ever greater confidence in the Venezuelan economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Venezuela is the world's third largest petroleum producer. Its recent decision to open up the oil sector to foreign participation has allowed British Petroleum to bid successfully, as part of a consortium, to develop the Guarapiche block. The state oil company, PDVSA, is undertaking a major investment plan over the next five years and intends to import $5.3 billion worth of goods and services. Our relations with Venezuela are cordial and the convention will strengthen our mutual trade and investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Finally the convention with Mongolia is a first and represents a welcome addition to our network of tax treaties in Asia. Mongolia is of strategic importance, situated as it is between the two enormous markets of Russia and China.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Foreign investment in Mongolia has been limited, but trade between the UK and Mongolia is starting to pick up. British firms are showing an interest in such diverse fields as cashmere processing, security printing and mining. They have also been involved in consultancies and projects funded by the World bank and Asian Development bank. A major British construction company successfully competed for part of the major construction projects at Ulaanbaatar airport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mongolia has only recently entered the tax treaty arena. We welcome the fact that Mongolia wants us as one of its first double taxation treaty partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend all three draft orders to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.35 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Dawn Primarolo 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good afternoon, Sir Roger. I thank the Financial Secretary for his kind remarks about my hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire. He is recovering and I hope that he will be back with us soon. I shall certainly pass on to him the Committee's best wishes, although the rumour that his illness set in at the prospect of scrutinising these three orders is completely untrue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members realise the importance of detailed negotiations and treaties for investment and trade. We recognise the hard work that goes into those negotiations. In general, the three agreements present no major problems. We welcome the extension of the United Kingdom's double taxation agreement network, which creates a more certain environment for our trade and investment overseas. However, I have one or two questions, mainly about the Argentinian treaty. I do not want to delay the Committee, but Argentina is an important trading partner, as is Venezuela. Mongolia soon will be too: the Minister was right in his introduction to emphasise that country's proximity to the large markets of Russia and China.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first point is a general one and concerns each of the draft treaties before us. In each treaty, article 15 grants exemption from UK tax to employees coming to Britain from countries that are treaty partners as long as that employee is not resident in the UK for more than 183 days; as long as that employee's remuneration
	<br><blockquote><p>"is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not"</p></blockquote>
a UK resident, and as long as
	<br><blockquote><p>"the remuneration is not borne by a permanent establishment or a fixed base"</p></blockquote>
owned by the employer in the UK.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People coming to work here on a temporary basis should obviously not be taxed when they are taxed in
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
their home country. The OECD has pointed out, however, that, in the past, the relief from tax has been exploited by the practice known as the international hiring out of labour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that the problem is not as great as it was a year ago, as the Revenue has issued a ruling, but some further clarification may be desirable. To make the matter crystal clear, will the Minister explain what was the intention of the treaty negotiators with regard to article 15(b)? How is the definition of "employer" in our domestic law interpreted in that article? It might be helpful if the Minister would give us examples of where relief would and would not occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the three draft agreements before us, the ones on Argentina and Venezuela present special features as some of the tax policies of both countries differ from ours and from those of most countries in the OECD. The negotiations reflect that. To be direct, I want to ascertain whether the Minister is satisfied that the United Kingdom got a good bargain from the negotiations and that, although the United Kingdom appears to have granted several concessions to Argentina and Venezuela that it did not grant in other treaties, our relationship with those two countries means that that has occurred for good reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 5 relates to the issue of permanent establishment—I am referring only to the Argentinian treaty—and states that the term "permanent establishment" includes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any other place of exploration for… natural resources."</p></blockquote>
It is unusual to extend the concept of permanent establishment in that way. Can the Minister explain why the extension has occurred and how it fits with the provisions in article 5(4) (e) and (f), which provide that there should be no permanent establishment for activities of a preparatory character? Can there be a place of exploration which constitutes a permanent establishment, but is not of a preparatory nature? Can the Minister explain, perhaps by example again?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 7(4) on business profits allows a tax on insurance fees not exceeding 2.5 per cent. of the gross amount of premium, even in a case where there is no permanent establishment by the insurance company that concludes the contract. Can the Minister explain the reasons for that concession? As far as I know, it has not appeared in any other treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 7(5) permits the attribution to a permanent establishment of profits of the enterprise arising out of contracts in which it has taken
	<br><blockquote><p>"an active and substantial part in the negotiation".</p></blockquote>
Again, could the Minister explain exactly how that will work and why it is necessary to include such a provision? How will the contribution of a specific enterprise be measured?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 11(3) is about interest and it limits the amount of tax that can be deducted from an interest
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0426">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
payment in many cases. Such cases seem mainly to be ones that will benefit Argentina and will not specifically affect the United Kingdom. We need to clarify the justification for agreeing a rate of deduction of tax as high as 12 per cent., which could be waived in so many cases. I should be grateful were the Minister to provide such clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister explain the reason for the rather unusual provision in article 11(8) (b) which relates to contracts for sale of holdings from which interest arises? Can he further explain why, in article 12(3), the term "royalties" is extended to include the right to use
	<br><blockquote><p>"industrial, commercial or scientific experience, and includes payments for the rendering of technical assistance"?</p></blockquote>
Article 21(5) deals with other income and grants taxation rights primarily to the country in which the income arises, rather than that in which the recipient resides. That appears to be another concession to Argentina, rather than the United Kingdom. I should be grateful if the Minister could explain that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final question on the Argentinian treaty concerns article 25(2), which allows countries to impose an extra tax of 10 per cent. on
	<br><blockquote><p>"the profits or income of the permanent establishment".</p></blockquote>
The United Kingdom does not impose such an extra tax, and I want to know why that concession, which is unusual in United Kingdom treaties, has been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that those are specific questions, and I should be happy for the Financial Secretary to write to me about the more detailed points if he is unable to respond now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the Venezuelan agreement, article 4(1) (b)—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am pleased to see that my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde (Mr. Graham) has joined us. Article 4(1) (b) deals with residents, but is unusual. Will the Minister tell us why it allows the Government of a state or its political subdivisions to be regarded as resident of the contracting state? That is apparently necessary because of the special provisions on royalties in articles 11(10) and 12(8), but I should be grateful if the Minister could confirm that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a little intrigued by article 8(4) on shipping and air transport, which provides for special treatment for
	<br><blockquote><p>"the operation of ships used for the transport of hydrocarbons".</p></blockquote>
Why has that provision been included on such narrow grounds?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That concludes my questions, and I should be grateful if the Minister could deal with them. I congratulate those who were involved in the detailed negotiations on the treaties—my lack of questions on the Mongolian convention had more to do with its
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
simplicity and similarity with the OECD model than with a lack of interest in the work that was involved or in the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.48 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I thank the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) for her kind comments about the work that has gone into negotiating the treaties, which were tough and demanding. People who go to such countries to negotiate treaties have told me that negotiations are sometimes demanding in more than an intellectual sense. I am sure, however, that they will draw comfort from the hon. Lady's remarks if they read the record of our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I thank the hon. Lady for the courtesy and care with which she presented her questions. She was right to probe the issues that she did and I hope that the Committee will not mind if I take a few moments to deal with some of them in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady dealt with article 15(2) (b) in the treaties and made some general points about the term "employer", which is clearly important. Under our domestic law, employees who come to work in the United Kingdom are taxed on their remuneration from duties that are performed here, whether they are resident here or not. Under our double taxation agreements, a limited exemption is usually offered where an employee is a resident of a country with which the United Kingdom has an agreement. One of the conditions for exemption is that the remuneration of the employee must be paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is intended that the word "employer" here should be understood consistently with the guidance and commentary on the OECD model convention. That means that where an employee works in a business of a United Kingdom company that obtains the benefits and bears any risks in relation to the work that is undertaken by the employee, that company is treated as his employer. That touches on the hon. Lady's point about a ruling. In fact, the Inland Revenue's view on the issue was reflected in an article in the June 1995 edition of 
	<i>Tax Bulletin.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom company would not be regarded as the employer where the employee continued to work in the business of the non-resident company, even though working at the premises of the UK company. An example that is crucial for an understanding of that concept is that of an employee who is sent to the UK company to service equipment that has been supplied by the non-resident company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of short-term secondees, it is unlikely that an employee would be sufficiently integrated in the business of the United Kingdom company for that company to be regarded as his employer. As a practical matter which limits the compliance burden on United
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Kingdom companies, the Inland Revenue does not take the view that a UK company should be treated as the employer for the purpose of article 15 where the employee is in the United Kingdom for less than 60 days in a tax year and that period does not form part of a more substantial period when the taxpayer is present in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady's next point referred to article 5 of the Argentina treaty. She wanted to know what definitions underpinned the treaty's reference to places of "permanent establishment". The phrase reflects Argentina's wish to extend the concept of a permanent establishment to include a place of exploration. That gives taxing rights over profits derived from the operation of rigs, drilling barges or exploration ships with fixtures to the sea bed. In practice, there is little interaction between paragraphs (4)(e) and (f) and that provision. For an oil company that is engaged in exploration and production, the process of exploration is preparatory in nature and not in itself profitable. The inclusion of the words "a place of exploration" in subparagraph (2)(f) is intended to deal with a situation where drilling is subcontracted out by the oil company to a specialised drilling company. Clearly, the area where the latter company carries out its works is a place of permanent establishment for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked a more general question as to whether we thought that we had got a good deal in the treaties. The general response by business to what we achieved answers that. After all, it is businesses and individuals who will ultimately be safeguarded by the beneficiaries of the treaties. Certainly in the case of Argentina, our informal discussions with the Confederation of British Industry revealed an acknowledgement that that treaty—and the other two—are good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Lady will understand, however, one cannot always get everything one wants from negotiations. Sometimes one has to make sacrifices and changes in the general balance of consideration as to whether or not a treaty is wanted. That was the case in all three treaties. I am satisfied that we have not given up too much and I think that the Argentinians think likewise. There has been gain on both sides for the greater good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady's next point concerned article 7(4), which deals with taxing rights over insurance premiums. She wanted to know whether we were right to have conceded that point. The Argentinians pressed strongly for the inclusion of that provision and the United Kingdom was willing to concede it in order to achieve an agreement that was acceptable to both sides. That is in line with what I said a moment ago about drawing up treaties. Modern Argentinian agreements include similar provisions. A few older ones do not include those provisions, but in other respects have less attractive features than the United Kingdom agreement. In the event that Argentina
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
concludes a new agreement with another OECD country that does not provide for taxation of insurance premiums, those will cease to be taxable under the United Kingdom agreement in accordance with the protocol to the current agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady then asked why article 7(5) had been included and probed me on how it would work. The United Kingdom has agreed similar provisions in recent agreements with India and Mexico. The provision represents a compromise between the OECD terms that the United Kingdom favours in article 7 and the United Nations model provisions that Argentina favours and has included in its conventions with most other OECD countries. This provision permits taxing in the source state where the permanent establishment has actively participated in winning business for enterprise. The measure of the permanent establishment's contribution and consequently the profits that should be attributed to it are made in accordance with the arm's length principle reflected in paragraph (2) of the article. I hope that that clarifies the hon. Lady's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady referred to article 11(3), which, it is important to note, also benefits the United Kingdom. She will see that the general concession in paragraph (2) is of greater benefit to the United Kingdom than Argentina, because Argentina is a net capital importer. Again, that point should be considered in the context of the treaty as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked about the purpose of the provision in article 11(8). That also intrigued me when I discovered that it is intended to prevent bond washing by exempt institutions, such as pension funds, that might otherwise pass on the benefits of the preferential rates given in the interest article to a person not entitled to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady probed the thinking that lies behind article 12(3), which enables Argentina to treat as a royalty payments made for business leases, and thus have a taxing right. Payments for leasing equipment were formerly included in the definition of royalties in the OECD model convention. In the 1992 revision to the OECD model, reference to payments for equipment leasing were deleted from the definition of royalties and these payments are considered properly to be treated under the business profits article. United Kingdom policy accords with that of the OECD and it is our preference to treat leasing payments under the business profits article. The inclusion of leasing payments in the definition of royalties in this agreement reflected an Argentinian preference to tax such payments at source. That is, from Argentina's point of view, consistent with its approach in other agreements. That is another balancing item to be taken into account in concluding the treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked why article 21(5) deviates from the OECD model and gives the source state—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0428">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Argentina in this case—taxing rights over other income. Argentina always seeks source state taxing rights over the income as reflected in its other agreements. In the past, United Kingdom policy has been not to include another income article unless it could be secured on OECD lines. However, it is now considered that an article in the terms agreed here provides significant protection against extra-territorial taxation. The key point is that it avoids technical problems in the taxation of dual resident individuals. Although it is a small group, it is an important and sometimes technically difficult area for these treaties to cover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady wondered whether article 25(2) sent out wrong signals. A number of United Kingdom agreements include provisions permitting the imposition of a branch profits tax. We do not favour the inclusion of such a provision. That concession must be taken into account in order to reach the agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked why article 4(1)(b) of the Venezuelan treaty should include Government and associated subdivisions. Government institutions play an important part in the Venezualan economy and in its trading activities, so it is right for them to be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. Lady probed the intriguing nature of the shipping provision, which mirrors an earlier
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
provision in a shipping treaty with Venezuala. It replicates the earlier agreement and there has never been a problem in the past. The terms are transferred into the double taxation agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the way in which the hon. Lady posed her questions. I hope that my answers were details enough to satisfy her. If she has any further technical points and would care to let me know, I should be pleased to write in greater detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
