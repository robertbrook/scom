	<div class='bill'>DEVELOPMENT LAND TAX BILL</div> <!-- bill -->

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed</i>—[
	<i>this day</i>]—that the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned I was starting to raise a number of points on which I am sure the Minister will be able to assist us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first point to which I want to draw attention is that in the penultimate line of subsection (1) one sees the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…if the Board are satisfied".</p></blockquote>
With those words in, the whole clause seems to be left to the discretion of the Board, which shows how unconvincing was the argument against our proposals in some of the amendments that the Board should have discretion in a number of cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was, however, a difference between what we were proposing at that time in the amendments and the discretion given to the Board here. The discretion given to the Board in subsection (1) seems to be a discretion as to whether facts are facts That is to say, if certain facts are put forward on the conditions set out in subsection (2) the Board can merely express an opinion that it is not satisfied that those facts are true and no appeal will arise at all from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chargeable person cannot appeal if the Board merely says it is not satisfied, unless, of course, it decided it on a completely wrong basis of the colour of the applicant's hair or something like that. In the normal way there will be no appeal from the Board's decision that it was satisfied or dissatisfied on any particular point of fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We discussed this earlier, and I ask Treasury Ministers to see whether, having given an undertaking on a previous occasion that these words would be revised so that at least one could appeal from the Board to the Commissioners, they could be looked at again in the context of subsection (1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>996</span>
I come now to the point about the relevant interest—again referred to in subsection (1)—having been acquired. As I understand it, it can be acquired at any time. We are not here tied to 12th September 1974, or any other date except that, of course, when two years have run out after the Act comes into operation we are dealing only with acquisitions after the Act comes into opeation, that is to say from the appointed day. Having looked at the last line on page 27 and the first two lines on page 28, I cannot imagine a more difficult way of expressing what I think is the intention.
	<br><blockquote><p>"and, for the purposes of paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) above, in any case where the owner acquired the relevant interest before the appointed day, it shall be assumed that the appointed day fell (and this Act was in force) before the time of his acquisition."</p></blockquote>
That sounds to me very like Dunne's theory of relativity of time, and I suppose one could explain it by the limerick:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There was a young lady called Bright
Who travelled much faster than light;
She set out one day
In a relative way
And arrived back the preceding night."</p></blockquote>
That seems to be what is intended by the two lines:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…it shall be assumed that the appointed day fell (and this Act was in force) before the time of his acquisition."</p></blockquote>
Could that not be expressed a little more simply? It does not matter what time the acquisition took place, and we do not want to have a fiction of this sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, may we have some assurance about the appointed day? I turn at once to the interpretation clause, Clause 46 and see that
	<br><blockquote><p>"'appointed day' means such day as the Treasury may by order made by statutory instrument appoint",</p></blockquote>
which statutory instrument is not laid before the House, nor is it subject to any procedure in the House. One assumes that that is the day of commencement of the Act. We have been informed that 1st August is the probable date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the provisions of Clause 46—and I apply that to Clause 18 about which we are talking—that appointed day could be any day. In fact, it could be some past day, certainly in accordance with the theory of relativity of time, as embodied in Clause 18. May we, therefore, have an assurance at this stage that the appointed day will be in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1105">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>997</span>
the future from now when the Bill comes into operation, and not some fictitious day for the purpose of different clauses in the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to subsection (3) about which we had some considerable discussion on amendments, I do not intend to repeat that discussion. The Minister said at the time that he was resisting an amendment to make it more specific that there would be directions to the tax offices about the operation of this subsection, that is about the Board asking for further information if it was not satisfied with the information that had been given to it before it rejected the application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that directions to tax offices will be sufficient. The public must know what the practice is to be. To that extent, I believe that a better way of informing the public is by a statement of practice rather than merely by directions through tax offices, which may not reach the public who have to try to operate under subsection (3). May we have something between the Board and the tax offices—not merely direction between the palace at Middlesbrough and the inspectors of taxes throughout the country, but something that is issued so that the public know what is happening?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) states
	<br><blockquote><p>"…if the project were to be begun forthwith".</p></blockquote>
I am sure that the Minister has not a clue what is meant by "forthwith". I do not know what it means here. Does it mean on the very day? The subsection says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…the Board shall notify the owner whether, if the project were to be begun forthwith, they would or would not be satisfied…"</p></blockquote>
Does that really mean immediately at that time? Or how is the Board to interpret the word "forthwith"? I hope that that will go into a statement of practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move down the page to subsection (5)(
	<i>c</i>), which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"immediately before the beginning of that project, there is a deemed disposal of the interest to which the notification relates".</p></blockquote>
From reading that on its own one might assume that before the project is started one must get rid of the property. But I turn back to Clause 2(1), where we find that a deemed disposal is assumed to take place
	<br><blockquote><p>"Immediately before a project of material development."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>998</span>
It is a little confusing when read in the context of this subsection. It seems to be a matter of applying the theory of relativity again, that the person gets rid of the property and then carries out the project of material development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those matters come within the clause, but two matters are not mentioned in the clause, and I should like information on how they are affected. I shall take together partnerships and trusteeships. Although elsewhere in the Bill we are told that each partner is assessed separately, I assume that the partnership, and indeed a trust with trustees, will be treated as one entity or unit under the clause, so that the partnership, or the trustees for the time being, who happen to have applied for this clearance will if the partners or trustees change, find that the benefit of the notification will not exactly run with the land but will run at least with the partnership or the trust. That is not mentioned in the clause. It may be brought in by other clauses relating to partnerships and trusts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other matter which does not appear specifically in the clause but might come in by implication, I suggest, is that it is only the interests of the person who applies for the clearance which are affected. There may be other persons with interests in the land who will not get the relief under the clause. In Clause 2 we see that there are major interests which can be affected by a deemed disposal, and I assume that it is possible that under Clause 18 there will be interests other than that which was acquired and in respect of which a development is intended within the two-year period, which may be subject to the tax. Again, I use the phrase that it runs with the person seeking the clearance and not necessarily with the land itself—that is, that it does not affect all interests in the land, only the interests of the person who has put in the request for a clearance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have explained my problems sufficiently clearly for the Minister to deal with them. If not, and I have swung them on him too fast, I hope that he will let us have his reply later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to raise three matters, two perhaps of a relatively minor nature, and a third which is more substantial. The first is a matter which I think that we may be coming to later in the batch of Government amendments. My question concerns the availability of relief under the clause, when one member
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1106">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>999</span>
of a group of companies acquires land and another group member actually carries out the development. I hope that I am right in surmising that later amendments will cover the subject, that a transfer between group companies will not eliminate the right to relief under the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second matter concerns the acquisition by inheritance. Would that qualify in the same way as an acquisition by other means?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A third and more substantial point relates to whether it should be two years at all. The more we have discussed this clause, the more I conclude that we on the Conservative side of the Committee are in error in not having tabled an amendment to change two years to three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask hon. Members to reflect upon the time involved in carrying out a development; the time required at the outset to prepare drawings—perhaps to obtain planning permission—the time required for bills of quantities, the time required for the builder to prepare his tender and, something of which you, Mr. Costain, are extremely conscious, the time that should be allowed to a builder after he has been awarded the contract before he is expected on site. Too early a start by the builder after he has been awarded the tender usually means that there has been a lack of preparation in forward organisation and ordering. Equally, too early a start in relation to the state of the drawings will lead to trouble at a later stage together with extra cost and waste of resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that the main substantial point relating to time is one which inevitably we shall have to come back to at a later stage. The more our discussions have progressed, the more it has seemed to me that this is an important clause which gives a worthwhile concession. However, it is very involved. The administrative procedures will be complex and therefore expensive, but I do not see how one can avoid this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is one practice which might be worth bearing in mind when experience is gained of this tax. This is whether at the time that the vendor is settling what DLT is payable, if any, it can be established that the price paid to the vendor was the full market price, so that one would not have to go through the procedure again when the developer comes back to claim exemption under this clause.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1000</span>
It would already have been established and be on the record, so to speak, that the price he paid to acquire his interest was the full market price and was so agreed when the vendor's DLT was being assessed. This is a point which might slightly simplify matters and help the Board to achieve the Financial Secretary's declared objective of giving its answer within 30 days or even sooner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Robert Sheldon)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) asked for clarification on several points, and I will deal with some of them. The hon. Member dealt with the question of a group of companies and its right to relief under the two years' provision. He rightly said that the position in relation to groups of companies would be dealt with later in the Bill. That might be a more suitable occasion on which to deal with the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point that the hon. Gentleman made about the two years' provision and the problems arising there from in connection with market value and its establishment. He said that it could be possible to establish market value with greater precision at the time of the original sale, and I understand the points that he made. However, I should have thought that in most cases this would not be a difficult matter to establish. Most of these operations will be fairly clearly observable in arm's length transactions: all that one would need to satisfy oneself of was that it was a transaction of that kind. I am not sure of the kind of documentation that would help to establish that at the time of the sale rather than being invoked subsequently. I shall be prepared to listen to suggestions that may be made on this matter. However, I do not think that it is a particularly difficult point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I might deal with the other questions in other parts of what I have to say in connection with my reply to the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page). The first question concerned the wording in subsection (1) requiring the Board to be satisfied that the conditions are fulfilled. The right hon. Gentleman wondered whether this might not be discretionary. My reading is that there is no discretion implied other than the natural one that is always upon the Board of Inland Revenue to do its duty. It is as simple as that. The Revenue has to be satisfied that conditions set before it meet the legislative requirements. If the right hon. Gentleman says
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1107">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1001</span>
that surely the actual wording of the clause itself would be sufficient to make clear what it is, I would direct him to one part of the clause, dealing with a significant amount of realised development value, a matter which was the subject of an amendment earlier and where clearly the Board needs to be satisfied on this, amongst other parts of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman talked about relevant interest at the time of disposal and asked that this might be put in more simple language. I am always delighted to help whenever I can, but I understand the problems of satisfying accuracy and understanding and, although I always understand the simpler language, I am never sure that it satisfies the accuracy that the courts will require in their eventual interpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about the provision made for the clause to apply in respect of pre-appointed day purchases by assuming that the Act was in force at the date of purchase, otherwise the two-year provision would be no help at all immediately after the appointed day. The right hon. Gentleman asked for a better interpretation than that provided under Clause 46. We shall come to that in due course, and I am sure we shall take note of the right hon. Gentleman's observations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position here is quite clear. The appointed day certainly will not be brought forward to some time in the past. [
	<i>Interruption</i>]. I was thinking of the problems the right hon. Gentleman referred to earlier. But a statement thas been made and it certainly would be adhered to that the appointed day will be after the Royal Assent, However, one plays about with time, that is clear to us all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman then asked for a statement of practice about the operation of this part of the legislation. I should have thought that what we have in mind is fairly clear, and as I have stated this in Committee that is as good a statement of a practice as one can reasonly get. I am sure that those who provide guides and information to those acting as advisers on behalf of people involved in these matters will be taking note of our proceedings. If there is any other way in which this information can be relayed, I shall be prepared to consider it. But I should have thought that what I have said so far would have met most of the requirements—I should have thought all—that the right
	<span class='label label-info column'>1002</span>
hon. Gentleman put to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman referred to partnerships and trusts. That trusts are covered by Clause 29(1) and (2). With regard to partnerships, if the partners themselves change or rotate, or if some drop out and others come in, the relief would run with a continuing partnership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the question put by the right hon. Gentleman is concerned with the case where there is an interest in land held by other people who could also be concerned. Here I might say that only the person applying will be affected by this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very useful relief. I think it is a little more generous than perhaps some people had considered we might be thinking about. The undertaking that I gave earlier to go into the question of the time element makes that generosity a little wider. Although, as I said before, it is without compliment, I shall be looking at that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may so, right hon. and hon. Gentlemen have had a pretty good run for their money on this clause in the concessions and undertakings that we have given in response to the valuable points that have been made. If we could accept the clause on the basis on which I have explained it we could move on to the next one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not demur from what the Financial Secretary said about the undertakings, assurances and concessions that have been granted in the course of our debates on this clause—I do not wish to detract from those in any way—but I want just to press two points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The words "…if the Board are satisfied"…mean that there could be no appeal from a decision of the Board. In other cases we have used the words "…if the Board or on appeal the Commissioners concerned are satisfied"…so it is clear that a decision could go to the Commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the taxpayer and the public in general are entitled to protection against an error by the Board in reaching a decision. There is nothing derogatory about saying that the Board may be in error. Indeed, a High Court Judge or a judge of the Court of Appeal may be in error and be corrected by another place in its judicial capacity, so I think we should provide an opportunity for people to go to the Commissioners if the Board appears to be wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I felt that the Financial Secretary passed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1108">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1003</span>
over too casually the question of a statement of practice. If he believes that the public read our deliberations here, he should think again. I have never yet found anybody who has read the Committee stage of a Bill, and certainly whatever a Minister may say has no strength at all; not nearly as much strength as a practice note from the Board of Inland Revenue. If that is issued, and if a Press statement is made on that statement of practice, people can follow it and know that it applies. Without that they will have to wade through the Committee stage to find out what the Financial Secretary said and perhaps, with great respect to him, interpret his words. They are perfectly explanatory to us here, but one knows that when one tries to correct one's speech in 
	<i>Hansard</i> for grammar or something like that one finds it shocking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a statement of practice is thought out carefully, published as such and the Board of Inland Revenue says that that is how it intends to administer it the public will know what happens. I press him on those two points. First, will he please consider an appeal to the Commissioners from the Board; secondly, will he give greater consideration to the issue of a practice note?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) suggested that those who are concerned with the development land tax are not likely to refer to the transcript of the proceedings of this Committee. I think that they may well be forced to do so because of the difficulty of understanding the legislation, and also because, for the benefit of all of us in the Committee, many things which have been explained in the course of our proceedings have gone much further than the explanatory notes published by the Inland Revenue, the statements of Ministers on Second Reading, or in more public circumstances than our deliverations here. Therefore, I felt it was rather significant that the Financial Secretary suggested that the record of our proceedings might in future be consulted as a means of interpreting this Bill. I believe that they will be consulted. I hope that he will take on board the point that my right hon. Friend made about the lack of statutory force of comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the Financial Secretary, as
	<span class='label label-info column'>1004</span>
always, explains things lucidly, and we all have the benefit of his explanations. This is, I hope, an abnormally complex piece of legislation. I certainly hope that other legislation will not follow the pattern which this one sets. Although we shall probably end by having 40 or 50 sittings of this Committee and there will be a large volume of oral records of what has been said, in many cases we have put down probing amendments and the Minister who when replying has gone out of his way to incorporate an explanation of an obscure passage in our proceedings. I hope that before we come to the end of our sittings, or at some later stage, or in some other way, if there are any statements by Ministers within our proceedings which are a little imprecise, or which, on reflection, they feel should not be allowed to stand uncorrected for the record, they will say so. The Minister of State has set a good example in this, and on one or two occasions when he has perhaps made an incautious remark or a remark which subsequently proved not to be entirely apposite, he has commented upon it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the importance of the proceedings in understanding much of what is being said, I hope that the Financial Secretary will follow through the logic of what he has just said by seeing that before the Committee proceedings are concluded or, as I said, at some later stage in a different way, appropriate action is taken to see that the proceedings of our Committee amount to an authoritative interpretation of this appallingly complex piece of legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) asked for appeal procedures to be included in this clause. It is a pity that an amendment to that effect was not tabled, because we could have dealt with it on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that this is a reasonable provision. It can apply to most parts of the legislation that we have passed, on finance matters, on property matters or, indeed, on any matters. When we ask an agency of the Government, or part of the Government themselves, to act in connection with the responsibilities of individuals we say, that certain conditions are held to apply, and that the agency, or whatever it is, should be satisfied that it is acting correctly. This is basic to the whole operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are saying is that the Board has to be satisfied that certain conditions are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1109">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1005</span>
fulfilled. This is a part of a great deal of legislation. I find it rather puzzling that the Opposition are making such a mountain out of our asking the Board to be satisfied that a number of straightforward considerations are so. This kind of provision is dotted about our legislation, and I find it rather surprising that we are making heavy weather of this part of this legislation. The Board has to be satisfied that certain information is correct. This is basic to the whole idea, and I do not understand the strong feelings that are apparently being expressed in regard to this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not disagree more with the Minister. Of course the Board has to be satisfied, but it follows from that that if the Board says it is satisfied there is no appeal from that decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Throughout this kind of legislation the onus is on the Board, to prove that the conditions meet with its requirements. If there is some doubt about some aspects of the wording which we have previously discussed, we shall look at that. If there is some doubt about further aspects of the wording I am, naturally, always prepared to consider that, but the need for the Board to be satisfied about the level of those conditions is reasonable. They have to ask that the Board is satisfied that the conditions are fulfilled. I should have thought this sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the right hon. Gentleman were to put down another amendment on further aspects of this wording I should be prepared to consider it in due course, but at the moment, I find the wording reasonable and sufficiently clear to ask the Committee not to go further into this but to hear further considered arguments which the right hon. Gentleman might subsequently wish to adduce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right of appeal is a fundamental matter, and I am surprised at it being raised on the "clause stand part" debate. If the right hon. Gentleman really feels that we are giving discretion at the level that he suggests, that is such a major matter that I should have thought it would have been the subject of a major amendment to the clause. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman did not take that
	<span class='label label-info column'>1006</span>
view, and I am not sure that I understand whether he takes that view even now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the Financial Secretary that I do take that view very strongly. An amendment was not tabled because we discussed the matter earlier on and I thought the principle had been accepted on previous clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not present during the debate on previous clauses. If the principle was accepted, I am prepared to give an undertaking to look at this aspect of it. If I am satisfied that there is a case, the matter will be properly considered before Report. I give that undertaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as the statement of practice is concerned, I am not sure that a Press statement is so much better. I should be surprised if, with an important piece of legislation such as this, we do not find ourselves with certain explanatory publications prepared subsequent to the passage of this legislation. I might say to the hon. Gentleman that the lack of statutory force of statements made in this Committee—to which he referred—applies to any Press statements. I should have thought that what I have said is a statement of practice that will be noted by those who are to carry out the examination and prepare the explanatory publications that I am sure are likely to follow. But I am concerned about duplicating and multiplying the number of pieces of paper. Unless they are necessary, we can make the operation of the tax more complex, rather than less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure how avidly the public read the Press statements that pour out from the Treasury and Inland Revenue on various matters. I think that the opportunity of having these matters debated in this Committee and finding their way into the kind of explanatory publications which I imagine are likely eventually to appear is the best way of dealing with it. However, I have an open mind on this, and if there is any information that can be given widespread distribution subsequent to the passage of this legislation I should be happy to consider doing that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

ment No. 210, in page 29, leave out lines 7 to 11 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'it is an industrial building or structure as defined in section 7 of the Capital Allowances Act 1968'.</p></blockquote>
Representations have been made to us on this relatively simple point that the incorporation here of what is described as the well-known definition of industrial building in Section 7 of the Capital Allowances Act 1968 would result in less confusion and be more equitable than the provisions found on page 100 of the Bill in Schedule 4(7), Class E. That is the reason for the amendment, and it seems a straightforward point. I hope the Minister will accept it, or explain why it would not be fairer and more sensible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Denzil Davies)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to use a different definition for the words "industrial building" from that incorporated in the legislation. As the hon. Gentleman said, it seeks to use the definition in Section 7 of the Capital Allowances Act 1968 and to substitute that for the present definition which relates to some planning legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present definition apears in Section 66(1) of the Town and County Planning Act 1971, so the question is whether the present method, as the Bill is drafted, is better than having it based on the Capital Allowances Act, which hon Gentlemen opposite would like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had some representations on this point, particularly from accountancy bodies who are possibly more conversant with operating the Capital Allowances Act than of the Town and County Planning Act. Perhaps that is why they feel strongly about it. Whether members of the Institute of Chartered Surveyors, honorary or otherwise, would prefer to operate the Town and Country Planning Act, I do not know. I suspect that perhaps they would, because they would be more familiar with that kind of legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister suddenly changed into somebody from the Department of the Environment that would carry more weight, but we are here dealing with a taxation Bill, and therefore there seems to be some merit in the case for basing the definition on taxation legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that we are dealing with a taxation Bill, but it is unlike other
	<span class='label label-info column'>1008</span>
taxation Bills inasmuch as it is impinged upon by planning legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Capital allowance legislation deals with a different kind of situation where a building has been built and allowances are given every year in respect of that building. We are here concerned with the industrial use category. We feel that Section 66(1), which confines the use category to industrial and manufacturing, is more appropriate. There is no great difference, because the capital allowances legislation does that also. It is, however, probably better suited to this legislation than to capital allowances legislation. The capital allowances legislation deals with certain other things which could not be brought into this legislation, for example, foreign plantations. It deals also with crops, and they do not come into this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not make those as substantial points. On balance, we think it is better that the definition should refer to the Town and Country Planning Act rather than to the Capital Allowances Act which is more of a straight taxing legislation, whereas this legislation is not straight taxing, in the sense that it incorporates so much planning law and land law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am, however, prepared to look at the matter again. We have had representations, and at the moment I think that the way it has been done is the better way, but perhaps the hon. Gentleman is not happy with that explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the Minister said about being prepared to look at it again, perhaps we, too, could look at it to see whether, apart from the important matter of foreign plantations, we can detect more substantial or subtle differences between the two, and return to this at a later stage. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the previous amendment dealt with Clause 19 we have not mentioned the principle of that clause, and Amendment No. 123 goes to the root of that principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with the development of premises belonging to a trader. In particular, we are dealing with premises which are to be developed for industrial purposes. If that event occurs, the trader will not immediately become liable for the tax: the tax will be deferred. We are not dealing with relief from the whole tax. We are merely dealing with relief for a period of time. This period of time will be of considerable use to the trader in what we have called in our previous debates the cash-flow: he will not have to find the tax until the premises are in use for the purpose of his trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am questioning in the amendment is why this relief should be restricted to industrial premises. It is not restricted in the definition of the trader. It is restricted only in the definition of the development which he is undertaking: it must be development of land for industrial purposes of that trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 123, would leave out the word "industrial", and the other amendments to be discussed with No. 123 are consequential. In many other places in the clause the word "industrial" appears, and removing it from those other places is consequential on removing it from line 11, to which Amendment No. 123 refers. Therefore, the conditions for relief under this clause—that is, for deferment of liability for tax—would be satisfied if the building which is produced from the project of material development by the trader were a building for the purposes of his trade, whatever that trade may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Clause 19 the Government have slavishly followed the principle that there is something good about industrial development and something bad about commercial development. The industrial development is done by the "goodies" and the commercial development is done by the "baddies". I think that the distinction is not true. There should not be such a distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our cities we require the commercial
	<span class='label label-info column'>1010</span>
development just as much as we require industrial development. In fact, in many cases in the larger cities it is more important to provide development of commerce than development of industry. It means that we are dividing up the conurbations between those parts of them which are devoted to industry and those which, in general, are the centres of the cities and are devoted to commerce. In many of the large cities it is of the utmost importance that we provide commercial jobs as well as industrial jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the provinces plead with the Government again and again to see that office jobs in particular, are transferred out of London to provide employment in the provinces. In my own area—Merseyside—it is recognised that there is a lot of unemployment in commerce. The unemployment figure on Merseyside is much higher than the average for the country, and that is not taken up entirely by the industrial unemployed. A large proportion of it is taken up by the commercial unemployed. Therefore, and in that area we need development of the commercial as well as the industrial sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In later amendments we shall deal specifically with types of trade outside industries. This set of amendments deals with the matter in a general way, merely by removing the word "industrial" and leaving the relief to apply to buildings used for the purposes of any trade. That goes very wide. It might include any type of trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the conurbations particularly, we are faced with heavy unemployment. It is there that we should encourage successful firms who have properties in which they can develop their businesses, and I believe that we should encourage them by giving them relief under the clause. This is not relieving them of the full tax. It is not relieving them of any tax. It is deferring it. It is making it easier for them to carry out the expansion of their businesses, which will provide jobs. I hope that the Minister will abandon the idea of there being some great distinction between industry and the rest of trade and allow this relief throughout trade.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Budgen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) has hit upon the serious issue of principle that arises in the course of our consideration of Clause 19. It is no small matter to defer liability indefinitely for development land
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1112">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1011</span>
tax. Under the clause, liability in respect of land developed for industrial purposes will be deferred in two instances, namely, until the building is sold or until it ceases to be used for industrial purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Liability for development land tax is to be based upon the historic value of money. If deferral of liability can cause the postponement of payment for as long as 10 or 15 years, even if inflation eventually gets down to 5 per cent., by the time the money comes to be paid the real cost of paying the tax will be very slight, indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one takes a more pessimistic view of inflation, and if we are really going to have hyperinflation in 1978, as people such as Peter Jay and Sam Brittan anticipate, the money that has to be paid in 10 or 15 years' time will be nothing. It will have no value at all. This is a serious and important privilege that is to be granted only to those who develop for industrial purposes. It is important that we should realise what the effect of this special right will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, it will prevent take-overs and the sale of buildings that have been developed for industrial purposes. Secondly, it will prevent the use of these buildings for other purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I deal now with the take-over and sale question. The Opposition believe that the best way to make sure that there is as much wealth as there can be for all the people is to maximise profits. We believe, therefore, that the right of the individual entrepeneur to sell his building for the best possible use of that building is an important matter, and should not be distorted by changing the tax system in favour of any one particular use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a person has developed land for industrial purposes with the advantage of the doctrine of Clause 19, he will be reluctant to sell that building at any future time for another purpose, thereby triggering the payment of development land tax. It will mean that in many instances scarce space will be locked up in an uneconomic use. It will mean, too, that in some instances takeover bids for firms that have unused industrial capacity will be aborted, because the take-over will come to the conclusion that while he might have a use for the particular land which is the subject of the take-over bid, the triggering of DLT makes the take-over unattractive. I know that take-overs are very much something that those who are taken over tend to resent, but they form a necessary part of a market economy. If we believe in compet-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1012</span>
ition, if we believe in stress and challenge in commercial matters, it is important that the threat of take-over, of market disciplines, should be there. The proposal is a distorting factor which will prevent such disciplines being applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of all, the proposal is part of a wider Socialist philosophy which we have seen many times since the war. It is the belief that industrial manufacturing is good and all other forms of manufacturing are bad. It is the old story about the useful people and those who are useless, about "We are sticking up for ordinary working people, and we do not much like the City of London and all those nasty sharks who do invisible exports", and so on. This is a typical manifestation of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a worrying fact that it arises from the belief held by many Labour politicians that they have some unique insight into the way in which our economy and society will develop. They cannot face the fact that the way in which our society and our economy will develop is unknown and is, indeed, unknowable. They want to be able to give order and certainty right into the foreseeable future. It is a terrible fact that, as a result, they have probably made many of the irreversible trends in our society deeper and more damaging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We see now the trend in which manufacturing industry is unhappily becoming less and less profitable. The Sandilands debate highlighted this. According to those who advised the Sandilands Committee, most of manufacturing industry has made no real profits over the past 15 years. We can ascribe it to inflation, to price control, to dividend control, to high rates of taxation, or to a combination of all those factors. But the awful fact is that the present Government have the extraordinary ideas that they must keep distorting things in favour of manufacturing industry. It does no good at all. It makes matters much worse. It flies totally in the face of the experience of all advanced economies, which tends to show that as an economy advances service industries tend to become more attractive. That was the experience of America and it will probably be the experience of this country. I do not know. I could be wrong in applying the American analogy to this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thing is clear, however. Labour politicians do not know, either. But they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1113">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1013</span>
reckon that they can influence these things, and they reckon that they can do it by persistently attempting to distort the economy to the benefit, they hope, of manufacturing industry. They have a rotten record in this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Huyton (Sir H. Wilson), in the days when he was, perhaps, one of the most exhilarating if also one of the most irresponsible of leaders of the Opposition, used to talk with great vigour about the white heat of the technological revolution. He used to go on a lot about how we should all be changing our jobs about five times every year and how we should all learn the new technology as quick as lightning. He did not, perhaps, take into account the fact that not everybody in this country is quite so intelligent as he or has quite so much interest in the detail of technology, and he rapidly found that the forces of conservatism, with a small "c", meant that most people very much disliked the idea of regularly changing their jobs and their expertise. So we got the philosophy of SET.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is remarkable that here in Clause 19 we get the whole philosophy of the SET idea produced in Schedule 4 Class E. It will give rise to the same distortions as SET. We shall have entrepreneurs looking with care at Class E and trying to find out whether they cannot get all their activities within one or other of those subparagraphs. No doubt the lawyers will also—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman's speech is more related to "Clause stand part" than to the amendment. Perhaps he will relate his argument to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I bow to your guidance on this matter, Mr. Costain. I was only making those general observations in order to make clear that the whole thrust of our attack against this clause will be upon the basis that we are fundamentally opposed to the distortion in favour of industrial investment alone. We wish throughout the whole course of our consideration of this important part of the Bill to extend this deferral privilege across a very wide range of the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not say that industrial development is in any way bad. We simply say that there should be no distortion in favour of any one part of the economy.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1014</span>
There is no difference, so to speak, between the moral virtue of British Leyland as opposed to Sainsburys, to take a particular example. Indeed, if I may say so as a disinherited grocer, there is no difference in moral virtue as between British Leyland and Budgens. We are not in favour of any form of distortion. We want to widen this, and we shall seek to do so as seriously and as fiercely as we can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was expecting more speeches. I take it that after the hon. Gentleman's splendid speech there is no more to be said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an amendment which, as the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) said, goes very far. It is not confined even to commercial developments as they are generally understood. It is not confined to retail shops—to Budgens or Sainsburys or any other worthy trade. It goes even further than that and covers the whole range of trade. It is important to say that at the beginning. The right hon. Gentleman made the point, and I think he recognises that that is one slight weakness in the amendment. We are concerned not with a small extension but with a major extension of the deferral privileged, as the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) calls it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause is not a case of the Government thinking that manufacturing industry is good and commercial development is nasty and bad. That is not the point at all, and I could not possibly make that point in this Committee as many of my hon. Friends would object.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not when the grocers are here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely what I am saying. The reason for the clause—I am sure, if I can speak for it, that the Inland Revenue would prefer to keep the tax as simple as possible—and for the deferral is that it was represented to us that many manufacturing companies, peshaps more so than commercial concerns, own land which they have bought adjacent to their factories. They may have bought the land some time ago when they did not need it but at some time in the future they may need to expand on that site and acquire some kind of planning permission. They might be affected by not being given some king of deferral exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the reason why the deferral
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1114">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1015</span>
crept into the legislation, because it was felt to be a greater problem for factories than for other kinds of property in relation to commercial development and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned with the factory, with land that adjoins the factory and land that was bought some time ago. The case of British Leyland was mentioned. In my own constituency, I have two British Leyland factories. They bought some land when they moved into the constituency some time ago and did not extend their factory. But there comes a time when they need the extra land and acquire planning permission and extend on the land. In that kind of situation we should consider some relaxation from the rules in the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we do not say that manufacturing is good and commerce is bad—that would be ridiculous—right hon. and hon. Gentlemen must accept that commerce over the past 10 or 15 years has been a successful part of British economy. The service industry, distribution, that side of the British economic scene, has been successful. What has not been successful for a variety of reasons is manufacturing industry. We have a problem here—the problem is greater in relation to factories possibly than other kinds of development, bearing in mind the decline that has taken place in manufacturing industry—and this is an attempt to give them some extra benefit to see whether we can do something for them, bearing in mind their poor record over the past 12 years. It is not an attempt to prejudice commerce or commercial development at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is much too intelligent to try that argument. An advantage given to one section of the community is a disadvantage to others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In some cases an advantage given to one is a disadvantage to others, but we are dealing with a completely different situation. An advantage given to British Leyland is not a disadvantage to Budgens, that well-known firm of provision merchants, because the one is operating in a completely different sphere from the other. The two are not competing with each other. We are not dealing with two competing sectors of the economy. If we were, I would agree with the hon. Member. If we gave an advantage to one and not to the other, then it would be wrong. But these are two separate areas of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1016</span>
economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West also said it would be inhibiting take-over bids, that generally people would not be prepared to sell their land, and that it would be distroting the economy. To carry his argument to its logical conclusion, he would create an even greater distortion if he says that by having this clause we are inhibiting take-overs and amalgamations on the industrial manufacturing side and then says "Let us extend it to trade in general and create those distortions in trade in general".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon Genetleman does not like the clause, the answer is not to have the clause at all, I should have thought, rather than extend it to other situations because it does not cover everybody. Even under the amendment, there will be some people who will not be given deferral of their tax. For instance, a farmer who sells his land will not be given a deferral. Deferral is a good thing, but it is bad to give it to some people and not to others. To carry his argument to its logical conclusion, the hon. Gentleman should give it to everybody; otherwise, he is not being fair. I do not understand the logic of his argument when he says that in one case we want it for commercial development but that deferral is a bad thing in general.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must make it plain. Our philosophy behind this attack is to extend the deferral right as widely as possible. The Minister is quite right about that. It may be an extreme position, but it is logical. If he considers for a moment, the Minister will realise that he himself is in an illogical position—extraordinarily illogical for a Treasury Minister—when he says that the advantage that is to be given to industrial manufacturers is not a disadvantage to others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Treasury Ministers are always saying that a tax concession given to one taxpayer is necessarily a tax disadvantage to others, because Treasury Ministers rightly believe in a balanced Budget, at any rate as an ideal and something towards which they are working—(
	<i>Interruption.</i>) I hope they are working towards it, even if not very hard. I am saying that it is plain that a certain amount of revenue has to be raised. If it is not raised from one sector, it has to be raised from another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's second point was that an advantage given to British Leyland does not prejudice, shall we say, the retail trade.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1115">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1017</span>
That is not true. Although they may not be directly competing in the sense of producing the same goods or services, they are competing for labour, for land and for scarce resources. Therefore, with an advantage given to him, a purchaser of a site taken for industrial purposes is in a stronger position in buying when he comes to compete for that site against a user for another purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I wonder whether I can help the Committe.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->

more money somewhere else, that Budgens and British Leyland are not in competition. Indeed, if British Leyland prospers, that is good for Budgens, I should have thought, because there is more money to buy groceries from Budgens. However I do not wish to pursue that argument.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is not intended to hit commercial developments or trade in general. It is intended to meet a particular problem that was represented to us in relation to manufacturing industry. Perhaps we shall be convinced by some of the arguments and representations, but, given the appalling state of British manufacturing industry, we do not want to do anything to damage manufacturing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have given this limited exemption so that industrialists cannot say "It is all your fault. It is because of this terrible tax. That is why we are in such a state of decline". We want to give them every opportunity to put their own house in order and make the same contribution to the economy as the service and commercial sectors have made over the past 10 or 15 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman recognized that this is a wide amendment. I do not want to go over the point again. It covers trade in general. Trade does not include only the service sector. I can think of all sorts of trades that might not be particularly worthy of this special relief. I looked up the definition of "trade" in in Sections 26(5) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'trade' includes every trade, manufacture, adventure or concern in the nature of trade."</p></blockquote>
That is a splendid definition. It is precise and tells us everything we want to know. Even if one has an adventure in the nature of trade—and the tax reports are full of cases of strange adventures in the nature of trade—presumably that also would receive the kind of exemption which would be given under this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman would not wish the exemption to go that far. As he said, this is a preliminary to a narrower amendment later. To extend it to trade in general would be going too far and would cover all kinds of situations even outside commercial development, and I ask the Committee not to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Amendment No. 171, in page 29, line 11, at end insert 'other than for offices'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now see that there are two reasons—perhaps three—why the Minister did not find the earlier amendment acceptable. The first was that the term "trade" is too wide and brings in things other than commercial operations. That immediately brings us to a badly drafted amendment, but one which certainly has that intent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I admit that my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhamption, South-West (Mr. Budgen) and I have not tabled the consequential amendments as we should have done, but I am confident that the draftsman would do our work for us far better than we could.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first of the Minister's contrary arguments is met by these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
His second argument I found extraordinary to be advanced by the Treasury Bench. The Minister said that we were not to help any commercial operations because they are moderately successful. Apparently, the whole of industry is suddenly classed as a total disaster area in need of help on every count. I am sure that many industrial concerns will be very displeased to be told that they are so unsuccessful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an extraordinary argument which is totally irrelevant to the purposes of the amendment. We are not stopping industry from having help. We are merely extending that help to other deserving areas. Therefore, the amendment is not in any way refuted by the second argument. I admit that I have taken them in the reverse order from that in which they were presented by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third argument was of considerable interest, even it it was totally mistaken.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1020</span>
As I understand it, it has been represented to the Government that many manufacturing concerns have land that they own for expansion and use for their own purposes. Therefore, they would be particularly affected by the terms of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to find it surprising, but I do not find it surprising, that the Government are advancing legislation and then quickly putting in relief clauses because their tax proposals will be damaging to industry and to commerce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had representations, but the White Paper on Land made this point quite clearly. This is not simply a case of thinking up a tax and then finding that it might be damaging. A specific point about which we were concerned when the White Paper was drawn up was the need to ensure that there was no danger to manufacturing industries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the Minister's point that the relief was mentioned in the White Paper. The Government realised even at that early stage that the tax was damaging to industry. We on the Conservative side of the Committee were deluged, as I hope was the Minister, with comments that it was inequitable to restrict this exemption to industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I wish to make is that the Minister is totally mistaken in thinking that it is only industrial concerns that have land that they have owned for a long time, which is available for expansion, and which will be used by the organisation when the development is carried out. One of the most important employers in the country, and one of the most important earners of foreign currency, is the tourist industry. That is an area which we have not discussed so far in our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Minister that last year foreign currency earnings from tourism were £1,400 million, a break-down of which shows that accommodation produced £320 million, £150 million came from catering in hotels and restaurants, £100 million from internal transport—better even than British Rail, which is not one of the most successful sectors of British industry—£110 million from entertainment, indeed the West End theatres, for which we have co campaign vigorously, benefit substantially as do all our entertainment ventures—and £300 million from fares paid to British air and shipping lines
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1117">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1021</span>
to and from Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister adds up those figures he will tell me that I am £420 million short; that portion goes into the shops, and I shall come back to this aspect in a moment. However, I want to make the point that the tourist trade is enormously important to Britain. The earnings that we can expect from that industry are likely to increase as long as we allow the industry to operate in such a way that it is able to meet the demand upon it and remain competitive in an increasingly international competitive sphere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a very recent circular put out by Joint Review of the British Tourist Authority, the English Tourist Board, the Scottish Tourist Board, and—of particular appeal to the Minister—the Wales Tourist Board. It arrived on my desk a few days ago, and it points out that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Britain was comparatively late in recognising the economic advantages of tourist development. It now has to compete with major destinations which have been building up their image and winning the confidence of the travel trade for a longer period. Now there is hardly a country anywhere which is not making efforts to win a share of this international business. The biggest danger is complacency…"</p></blockquote>
Further on in the same document it is pointed out that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are certain imbalances in the supply of hotels, of which there is at present a surplus of higher priced accommodation whereas the forecast growth in demand is mainly for lower priced. This situation poses long-term problems…"</p></blockquote>
It is quite clear that many hotels would fall into the category of those having land available for expansion, in most cases having been owned for a very long time on which hopefully they will be able to carry out development to meet this very imbalance that is referred to in this review and to meet what is a growing demand from overseas tourists and a demand which we particularly want to grow in the Provinces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair to say that the hotel and catering trade is in a similar position to manufacturing industries with regard to the damage that could be done to it by the terms of this legislation unless it, too, is allowed to benefit from the reliefs which are at the moment supposed to be confined to industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British Hotels and Catering Association put the capital allowances on commercial buildings absolutely at the top of its request to the Government, and clearly
	<span class='label label-info column'>1022</span>
it does not want to have a fresh tax discrimination against it on the same sort of count. But, as I mentioned earlier, £420 million of the 1975 earnings from tourism came through the shops. I was reminded recently that the estimate at the moment is that the downturn in orders for shop premises to builders was no less than 25 per cent., which is a remarkable decline. New orders for retail premises are 25 per cent. down on a year ago and I do not think on reflection that the Minister would hold that one can benefit an industry, whether it be doing well or doing badly, if one at the same time damages retail and wholesale distribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a "Neddy" working party under the chairmanship of Mr. Welsh of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which published a most interesting report which I hope is available to the Minister. In its recommendations it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Working Party recognises that the prime task of the distributive trades is to operate a keenly competitive and efficient market…It believes that the interests of the consumers, suppliers…"</p></blockquote>
which is industry
	<br><blockquote><p>"and therefore of the nation as a whole are served thereby…it recommends that the contribution that the EDC should make towards a positive overall policy for distribution in the national economy should be to call for specific pieces of action from Government,…"</p></blockquote>
That was a fairly clear request that the Government should not discriminate against retailers. Indeed, it was interesting that in its report the working party referred to the development of an industrial strategy for distribution, so even the terms seem to get a little mixed up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In making specific recommendations on Government policy, the Report states that distributive trades had traditionally been excluded from advertisement incentives and employment subsidies. The temporary employment subsidy is a rare exception. It should be recognised that many individual retail establishments are large employers. On that point, it is significant that a large department store would typically employ over 500 people, a major superstore over 300, and a supermarket commonly at least 100 people. So, compared with the level of employment in industry, these are very significant numbers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 8, under specific recommendations, says:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1118">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1023</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Government policies towards the distributive trades (e.g. on investment incentives) need to take into account their impact on efficiency and investment, and on the ability of employers to provide good wages and working conditions."</p></blockquote>
We have every indication that distribution is a vital part of the national economy and it is both the supplier industry, on the one hand, and the consumer, on the other, who benefit from the efficiency of the retail trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know from personal experience of the trade and I expect that the hon. Members for Edmonton (Mr. Graham) and for Woolwich, East (Mr. Cartwright) will know from theirs, that in many cases retailers have land associated with a store, or perhaps a relatively small shop, which will be retained for a long time but which is earmarked eventually for substantial expansion beyond the limits of the 10 per cent. exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that the affairs of, respectively, Europe and Wales should have deprived us of the presence of the hon. Members for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) and for Aberdare (Mr. Evans), who I know would be keen to add their voices to our discussion of this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know from my own quite lengthy experience in the retail trade of the very large number of cases where a retail development to improve efficiency and the utilisation of resources, and to improve the service to the supplier and the consumer, takes place on land which has been owned for a very long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) has already referred to the important breakthrough that the Sandi-lands Committee on Inflation Accounting made when it clearly
	<br><blockquote><p>"recommended that the Government should consider extending the system of capital allowances to include commercial buildings on the grounds that fiscal discrimination between categories of business is undesirable."</p></blockquote>
I think that has been recognised in quarters that might appeal even more to the Minister when I refer him to the Chancellor of the Exchequer's letter to the retail consortium dated 4th December 1975. I hope he has a copy in his brief, but just in case he has not, or cannot lay his hands on it, I shall remind him that the Chancellor said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I accept the view that in principle commercial buildings should receive capital allowances. The difficulty—which I fear is a very serious one"—</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1024</span>
I appreciate that difficulty—
	<br><blockquote><p>"particularly at the present time—is the cost."</p></blockquote>
That argument cannot be used in respect of this tax. There is no valid justification at all for arguing that the exemption granted to industry under this clause should not apply to commercial operations, particularly retailing and catering, on the ground of cost. That is not the problem. Since the Chancellor has clearly recognised that, in principle, commercial buildings should receive capital allowances, I really do not see why we cannot accept that commercial buildings should receive the same exemption as industrial buildings in respect of development land tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I greatly hope that the Minister will be able to accept this amendment or, if the wording is incorrect—I pointed out that we have not put in the consequentials—find a better way to provide similar relief, particularly to the hotel, restaurant and catering trades and to the retail trade.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not meant to intervene, but the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) about the tourist trade made me think about caravans, and with caravans I thought about mobile homes and mobile home site operators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that it was really only those people who were involved in extending factories who were particularly hard hit, and this is one of the reasons put forward by him for proposing to discriminate in favour of factory ownership. Whatever he says, there is here an element of discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I warmed to my hon. Friend's argument that the point is not well taken that one is able to make the case that there are many other operators and many other people in many other forms of decision making about land who, in their own way, are hit equally hard by this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly concerned about mobile home site and caravan park operators from whom I receive a lot of constituency representation. I hope I am not out of order in saying this, but I think it is relevant. I am particularly worried by the fact that they are likely to be the most hit by the terms of Schedule 1 which make no allowance for temporary planning permission. I believe that caravan and mobile home site operators particularly in need of some form of protection because of the temporary planning permission arrangements in the Bill, and I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1119">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1025</span>
hope that the Minister will say something about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To judge from some of the Minister's remarks at our thirteenth sitting—there was a certain amount of confusion and I re-read the passage several times—it seems that he may be reconsidering the whole question of temporary planning permission. If he is, the remarks that I have been making are not as significant as I am suggesting they are. If he is not, I put in a special plea, not just on behalf of my constituents, but for the operators and owners of all mobile home sites and caravan parks. I am using this as an illustration of the problems that arise once one starts to discriminate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate what the Minister is saying. My hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) mentioned a number of categories that are affected. I am concerned at the moment with caravan and mobile home site operators, because when we consider them we are considering not just the question of tourism referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Hove, but the whole question of the provision of homes. Certainly in my part of the world, these people play a substantial part in providing homes for people who otherwise would not have them. I beg the Minister reconsider the principle and the argument that he is using in favour of factories. I ask him also to reconsider the terms of Schedule 1. I understand he has already indicated that he may be rethinking the question of temporary planning permission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Budgen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish only to ask the Minister to reassure me about a point of fact. He said a moment ago, and I believe my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) took up what I believe may be the same fallacy, that the granting of this privilege to industry was in the White Paper, as he put it, and I think he meant by that the White Paper of 12th September 1974. I have been trying to find the White Paper of 12th September 1974. I have not a copy with me, but I have a fairly clear recollection of the stormy and vigorous times that my hon. Friend and I had together during the Community Land Bill proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember taunting—it must be said that that was the word—the Minister for Planning and Local Government about the effect of his proposals on what is now called "extension land". My recollection
	<span class='label label-info column'>1026</span>
is that he was then saying that such land would be covered by development land tax. Because I did not have my copy of the White Paper dated 12th September with me, I asked him to take advice on that—I see that someone has such a copy—and, indeed, the only thing that I could properly describe as a White Paper that I had with me today, was of course the first attempt at publishing a Bill of this nature. I think that that was the Department of the Environment's rather poor shot at it before the Treasury took over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When looking at page 5 of Command 6195 I do not see even in that any paragraph devoted to this deferral in respect of development for industrial purposes. I should like to know when this came in, because it may have come in a fair while later, and it could just be that some of the things said during the course of the Community Land Act proceedings were listened to by someone. Of course, I am not accusing the Minister who conducted those proceedings of not having listened to a blind word that we said, but it may be that someone later on in his Department actually took more notice of some of the things we said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the things which I perceived during the course of the proceedings on the Industry Bill was that there is some sort of prejudice on the other side in favour of industry as if it were a favoured form of the production of wealth. Filthy as the word "wealth" may be, it nevertheless happens to be the source of taxation—no wealth, no profit, no tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am extremely perturbed to think that that prejudice might persist in this Bill. After all, there is nothing particularly special about industry. The fact that it is pursued in a factory rather than in a shop or a hotel does not sanctify the process of working to obtain a wage for oneself and to benefit from it which, after all, is what work is all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have the good fortune to represent a constituency of some 8,000 square miles in which most of the employment—not in agriculture—is obtained seasonally by the tourist industry, with great effort and difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's first explanation on a previous amendment—that industry was so unsuccessful that it must not be damaged—could equally be used for commerce. I hope that the Minister will be able to apply himself to the argument I am
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1120">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1027</span>
about to advance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister advanced his argument, it occurred to me that it came strange from a Minister representing a Government who only last Thursday suggested that another £1,050 million should be extracted from this industry which is so sick that it cannot bear the competition of commerce, a Minister who is a member of a party whose General Secretary proposed this week that the National Enterprise Board should have £1,000 million per year in order to cure what was called "the investment strike" of British private industry. It is like saying, when throttling a man, that one will stab him in the back and take three pints of blood from him because he is on a breathing strike.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have come to the conclusion that the difference among hon. Members opposite between the moderates and the extremists is that the moderates take the view that money should, like air, be free and abundantly available, and the extremists take the view that it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not, therefore, particularly impressed by the concept that poor little beloved industry under nurse National Enterprise Board—or, in my purblind country, under two nurses, Sister Scottish Development Agency and also Nurse National Enterprise Board—is such an ill old lady that she cannot bear the competition of spinster commerce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A recent study was made in Edinburgh by team from the University of Philadelphia, appropriately enough. Unfortunately, the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Crawford), who is such an adept at these things, did not do it himself, so we imported some Scots expatriates, no doubt, from America, as we should not like to think that others were as good as we are—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

But this team did some research into the Edinburgh Festival, which lasts for three weeks, and they calculated that in three weeks the tourist trade in the region of Edinburgh generated £20 million. That is the important thing in terms of external trade and the internal trade of tourism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. and learned Friend tell the Committee what the hotel situation is in the region of Edinburgh? Is there, perhaps, at the time of the Festival a shortage of suitable accommodation, or an absolute shortage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the time of the Festival there is a shortage of accommodation. Of course, a large number of hotels wish to expand, and they will be caught under this very basis. But they are not so rich, as a result of their trade, because it is a seasonal trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituency depends entirely upon this trade. The population is only held there by this extremely fragile seasonal trade. Any tax on development made in that direction would be critical to keeping the rural population in the country. It is vital for the country that this money is generated, and second, it is vital that there is no block to possible development and ways in which, in the rural areas, we can develop. Perhaps the only benefit that the Government have bestowed upon anybody is that they have made the pound so worthless abroad that we are forced to stay at home and boost the tourist industry. It is one of the few benefits that have fallen from the black clouds of their behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are very sensitive as to whether it is "commercial" to extend a hotel, to build chalets, or whatever it is. This is futile, bogus and false notion. I hope that the Minister will withdraw that argument. I do not know where he got it from. Why should he say "There are lots of factories who have a nice little bit beside them that they have to build on, but nobody else has"? There is enough land in my constituency for anybody to extend anything and, not content with that, this rediculous organisation, the Scottish Development Agency, is puffing around in my constituency to seek places to build factories where nobody wants them. But that is beside the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tourism is a very fragile trade in Scotland, as I am sure the Minister knows. The Highlands and Islands Development Boards and all these fancy agencies prop up the trade because it is seasonal. It has its season and a very difficult time for the rest of the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure the Minister can obtain advice from such agencies as the Highlands and Islands Development Board. It would be critical if it were to be affected by a tax
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1121">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1029</span>
on development. What is wrong with commerce? Why should a distinction be made? It does not matter whether it is a factory, an hotel or a shop. One is working to produce wealth for oneself and wealth for others. That is what work is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In case any of the Government's supporters have not read it, although I am sure they have—certainly the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire has not read it, but I would not expect him to read the work of a compatriot—I suggest they read in the 200th anniversary, Mr. Smith's work—a minor man with a modest name who came from a little town in Kirkcaldy. Whether one calls it commercial, industrial or retail, or whatever, human effort is translated into weath.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a very artificial distinction to cover only industry, and I have a horrid feeling—the Minister can dispel it if it is only a feeling—that one does not only have union power in shops and hotels and in the tourist industry. The only sort of union they know about in my constituency is not presided over by Mr. Jack Jones. That is certain. There is a suspicion that industry is a good thing because it is union-dominated and commerce is bad because it is not union-dominated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who creates the wealth that enables the Treasury to confiscate and waste it? It is commerce, just as much as industry—indeed, perhaps more so and 
	<i>per capita</i> much more so. It is quite wrong that there should be this artificial, false and bad dis-incentive to one of the industries which can make an infinitely larger contribution if it is allowed, and is in just as fragile a position as any other part of the fabric of British wealth-making activity. I hope that the Minister will take sincerely any activity in which work is made to produce wealth for the producer and, therefore, for the community—it is the community with which the Government are concerned—and will allow categories to have the same exemption. It is ridiculous to say that industry is fragile when comparing a small machine-shop that turns out one product, with ICI and some multi-national and an oil corporation and then say that a two-roomed hotel in Gleneagles owned by British Rail, and Boots and Mrs. Snodgrass's shop on the corner are so rich and wealthy that they might beat the whole of the rest of industry. Such false categories must not be made. I trust that the Minister will remove this artificial, unfortunate and,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1030</span>
possibly, prejudiced distinction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had another interesting debate on this important point I shall not reiterate what I said in the last debate although, in deference to the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbiarn), I shall try to touch upon some of my arguments again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the outset I made the point that the Government are not seeking to be beastly to nasty commerce and good to industry. That was not the purpose. I have explained why the provision is framed in this way. Certain representations had been made to us in relation to factories, in particular, and we tried to respond to them in a limited way in this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the question raised by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen). He asked in which White Paper, document or Press release was it to be found. I am told that the origin of the industrial deferment which we are now debating is to be found in paragraph 51 of the White Paper on Land. The scheme adopted in the Bill was announced on 4th February 1975, and reiterated in the White Paper on DLT.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is paragraph 51, and I have it here now. The point that the Minister is not making and which he should put on the record is that there has been a substantial extension of the original proposals. Paragraph 51 of the White Paper on Land states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Many industrial firms now own land on which they plan to extend for their own use. The arrangements for collecting developing land tax will be framed in such a way as to minimise the risk of difficulty for such firms."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 46 of the White Paper on the Development Land Tax states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The White Paper stated that the arrangements for collecting DLT would be framed in such a way as to minimise the risk of difficulty for firms then owning land on which they plan to extend for their own use. It has been decided that there should be a more comprehensive relief for industry. The relief will apply to the development for industrial use of land whenever acquired and to new industrial buildings as well as to extensions to existing buildings."</p></blockquote>

Gentlemen opposite who have a wide and deep experience of these matters. I did not go on to say that there is an extension of paragraph 51. I was trying to draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to this paragraph to reinforce the point that representations were made at an early stage that there might be a problem here for factories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman made some mock or humour of it to the effect that here were these factories "with a bit of land on the side". There are lots of factories with a bit of land on the side. I should have thought it would be more likely with a factory than with a hotel, for instance, or an office development. Factories are different in that they are often located in different areas of the country, sometimes on greenfield sites where land will be bought additional to their present requirement. The companies then seek planning permission and expand if possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I interrupt to prevent the Minister from making a complete fool of himself. I suspect that that argument was not on his brief. The suggestion that factories are on greenfield sites and hotels are not is one of the most preposterous and asinine comments I have ever heard. I invite him to come to Scotland. I shall take him from one end to the other, and if he can find anything that confirms that preposterous suggestion, all I can say is that I hope to be invited back to Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be delighted to take up the hon. and learned Gentleman's invitation. If you wish to adjourn the Committee now, Mr. Costain, we could, no doubt, catch the earliest possible train.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the Minister's prerogative to adjourn the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am perfectly willing to invite everybody—industrial and commercial—on the Committee. We can catch the 7.40 fast express. But I would rather go by British Caledonian.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to you, Mr. Costain, for informing me that it is the Minister's prerogative. I did not know that. Had I known, perhaps the proceedings of the Committee might have been different. I am sorry that I departed from my brief. Sometimes it is necessary
	<span class='label label-info column'>1032</span>
to do so, as the hon. and learned Gentleman probably knows from his experience in the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may leave that point for a moment and return to the one made by the hon. Member for Worcestershire, South (Mr. Spicer). He is not in his place, but no doubt he will see the record of our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend explained to me that he had to leave the Committee for another engagement and wished me to take over the point that he had made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.30 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that explanation. I shall try to deal with the point, and, if I do not deal with it adequately, I shall look at it again and write to the hon. Member for Worcestershire, South. I think that he was referring not to temporary permission but to limited permission. The Bill takes account of limited permission, and if that is what he was referring to I think that his fears would be unfounded, because on a deemed disposal the market value would reflect the limited nature of the permission. That may not help very much, but I have put it on the record, and no doubt there will be an opportunity to raise the matter again, or, as I say, I could write to the hon. Gentleman if there are further thoughts on the point. He dealt specifically with mobile home operators in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I could return to the amendment, which seeks to extend the relief to commercial property, excluding shops—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, offices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry—excluding offices. The hon. Gentleman had palpitations. The mistake was quite unintentional. Most speeches related to commercial development, but as I read Amendments Nos. 170 and 171, if they were accepted the Bill would read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or commercial other than for offices".</p></blockquote>
For some reason, offices are nasty. If it said that we think commerce is nasty, presumably the Opposition think that offices are nasty. I cannot see the justification for excluding offices on the argument that one should not discriminate in this way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1123">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1033</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the characteristics of offices, not of commercial operations, is that they are frequently occupied by civil servants and local government employees, as well as that thoroughly wicked lot the professionals, which brings in the wider definition of trade that worried the Minister earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I understand the hon. Gentleman correctly, offices are excluded because they have people working in them with nasty professions, like barristers and learned advocates—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to ask the hon. and learned Gentleman whether offices included or excluded barristers' chambers in Scotland or England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, even in England barristers' chambers are factories, so they would be covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman is quite right: some barristers' chambers are factories.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends on the extent of their industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not seeking to make a frivolous point. I can see that offices are excluded, and I was not sure why. I do not labour the point, but I was surprised that the hon. Gentleman said that the professions and people who work in offices were excluded from "commercial". I could not quite see the logic. Once we accept "commercial", I cannot see why offices should be excluded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister appreciate that the professions never have offices in greenfield sites, and there is no question of expansion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt, the hon. and learned Gentleman will develop that point later, but I shall return now to the word "commercial". It has been assumed that, whereas the word "trade" was too wide for the purposes of the previous amendment, "commercial" is a splendid word and everyone knows the meaning of it. I am sorry to disappoint right hon. and hon Gentlemen, but I have no idea what
	<span class='label label-info column'>1034</span>
"commercial" means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about "industrial"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Industrial" means that there is a classification of use. We have not sought to define "industrial" in the sense of defining the word, but there is a classification of purposes or uses which are industrial. That is the only way one could deal with it. The amendment says "or commercial". I ask again: What does "commercial" mean, and why is it different from trade? "Commercial" is a word unknown in fiscal legislation, so far as I am aware. An adventure in the nature of trade, yes. The words "trade" and "commerce" are used colloquially, but "commercial" has no meaning so far as I am aware, in any fiscal legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Members said on the last amendment—I accepted this, and said it in good faith—that "trade" was too wide, I cannot for the life of me see how "commercial" is narrower. Indeed, they recognised the problem by excluding offices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, the Minister must know that "commercial" is used in planning law in a very definitive way. Nobody suggests that that is difficult. "Development for commercial purposes" is a well known term in planning law. There is no difficulty about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not presume to be an expert on planning law, especially in this Committee with the right hon. Gentleman as a member. No doubt, he would tell the Committee that "commercial" is a precise term in planning law. I do not know. I have my doubts. It would seem that in planning law one can refer only to categories of use for specific purposes such as offices, retail shops or hotels. "Commercial" is a very wide term.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether I could help the Committee on this matter. The phrase may be imperfect, and I said that when moving the amendment. My argument was based on two particular categories of use, retail shops and tourism—hotel and catering. In Schedule 4, paragraph 7, Class C would cover the second category, and half of Class B would cover the first. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could look at the matter in that light.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1124">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1035</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that entirely, but the hon. Gentleman related his argument to retail shops and tourism, which presumably covers hotels, so he should like retail shops and hotels excluded. Does he want anything else excluded? Or does he merely want retail shops and hotels excluded? He does not want offices excluded, apparently, if they are offices in hotels. I do not know whether offices in hotels would be excluded. I shall not pursue that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman is now saying that he wants the exclusion of retail shops and hotels, that is another argument, and I suggest it would be another amendment. We are being asked to incorporate an amendment to add "commercial". I think I am making a fair point. I do not know what "commercial" means, except that it means practically the same as trade in general—an adventure in the nature of trade or commerce. One could not possibly argue on the one hand that "trade" is too wide and "commercial' is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister then saying that he is willing to put in a definition which covers the activities which we consider to be covered by the word "commercial", namely, hotels, shops and light industry which cannot be classified as industry—all activities of the community which cover profitable enterprise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman should not ask me that. What lie is now asking is whether I am prepared to limit it in some way by including shops—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, extend it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, limit as well, because the question that has been asked is: Why draw the distinction between factories, on the one hand, and commercial development, on the other? Now the hon. Gentlemen wants to draw a distinction between what he considers to be different classes of development. He said "include shops and hotels" but not anything else. There could be other so-called commercial developments which he does not want to include.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the difficulty. We have to list classes of use. My hunch was correct. I am told that planning law splits development into categories: shops, offices, theatres, and so on. Again, that is the only way it can possibley be done. The hon. Gentleman does not like offices, so he would exclude offices from the list. Presumably,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1036</span>
he would leave in shops, but what about theatres? Presumably, they would come into the definition of being of assistance to tourism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make these points again, in all sincerity, merely to show the difficulty once one gets away from the tight industrial manufacturing classification. I know that hon. Gentlemen opposite do not like the manufacturing classification. I agree with 90 per cent. of what they have said, but as I said at the beginning, I do not believe that there is such a thing as good manufacturing and nasty commerce or nasty distribution. That is not what we are saying. They all contribute to the economy. The other point, that perhaps in 50 years we shall all be working in distribution and that machines will be operating in factories, may be valid, but that is not the issue now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see how one could accept an amendment which says "commercial" when I do not know the meaning of "commercial", and hon. Gentlemen opposite do not know, either. I suggest that they are back with their original amendment—"in the course of trade"—or some such, because one cannot draw a distinction between the one and the other. But that amendment was too wide also, so we are in considerable difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to consider incorporating a phrase such as "commercial", we should have to make value judgments. The hon. Member for Hove has criticised us for making a value judgment, but he has made a value judgment by excluding offices. The categories of exclusion and inclusion would become very complicated for that reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hove referred to the Sandilands Committee recommendation that capital allowances should be extended to commercial developments. He read a letter written by my right hon. Friend. We said that we could not see that generally in fiscal legislation there was any justification for that kind of distinction. The Sandilands Committee itself never addressed its mind to the meaning of "commercial". I did not see any discussion of "commercial" in the Sandilands Report. I was surprised that such a distinguished committee should make a redommendation without clarifying a word which is extremely wide in meaning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Capital allowances legislation, as I have said, does not extend to these cases. Frankly, there are considerable difficulties, and for that reason I could not recommend
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1125">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1037</span>
the Committee to accept the amendment, as it would be as wide as the last one. The same problems of deciding what is or is not commercial would arise, and even if we included offices there are other categories which some people would want to exclude and others want to include.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to be negative, but I am afraid that is as far as I can go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that that is the worst argument that the Minister has yet advanced to refuse any amendment. The truth is that he had no argument to put forward, so he had to use that one. He says that the Government think it would be unfair—we do not think that all of industry should be excepted, we do not think that all of commerce should not be excepted—but the word "industrial" is defined somewhere, and "commercial" is not, so we must do it because the word is defined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt, but the word "industrial" is not defined, as far as I can see. Industrial uses or industrial purposes are listed. I was saying that if one wanted to include the word "commercial", one would have to list the categories of "commercial" which one wanted to benefit. One might want to benefit all of them or exclude offices, as the hon. Member for Hove wanted to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is just not good enough to say that, because there happens to be, as though Cain and Abel had put it there, Schedule 4, which lists the categories of industrial use, therefore we are not willing to consider anything else. If there is no definition of "commercial", the Government should say "We accept your argument as being right in principle, and therefore we will make a list". It is not right for them to say that we ought to make the list, though we should be perfectly happy to do so if the Minister had warned me. But if they accept that the argument is valid, the Government should say "Quite right: we will put in the word 'commercial' or any other word that we like and define what it means".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister accepts the argument in equity, he cannot get away with his bogus argument tuat the only reason that he will not accept the amendment is that "industrial" happens to be defined in Schedule 4 and "commercial" is a word that can mean all things to all men. The Minister knows
	<span class='label label-info column'>1038</span>
what it means. If he accepts that it is right, that these are important sectors of productive activity—if I may use words which are not defined but I hope are understood—let the Government find a formula to do it and let them accept it in principle. But merely to say, and to rest his argument on the fact that Schedule 4 happens to categorise industrial and does not categorise commercial is to shirk the issue. I beg the Minister to say that at a later stage he will allow categories of what call productive activity of all kinds to be included in this exemption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.45 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I found the Minister's answer profoundly unsatisfactory, and disappointing coming from him. He appeared completely to ignore what was said by the Sandilands Committee, on the specious ground that there was a lack of definition. He ignored his own right hon. Friend's statement in his letter on the point of principle, which is surely what matters here—to which my hon. and learned Friend has just referred—and produced the most feeble argument for rejecting the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a matter of regret that, although well represented in the Committee, the voice of the great Co-operative movement has not been heard at all on this issue. It has been debating it for a long time and the Co-operative movement has made representations, yet not one word has been raised from the movement on this point, which I know it regards as important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is absolutely clear, on the Minister's own argument. He says that industry would be damaged because it holds land which it has, perhaps, held for a long time for purposes of expansion. Exactly the same argument applies to retail and wholesale distribution, and to many hotels, pubs, restaurants and catering premises. There is no reason why the Minister could not easily draft an amendment which would be more precise and satisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman still has not told the Committee why he himself is excluding offices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am basing my argument on the Minister's own argument—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the hon. Gentleman's amendment, not mine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1126">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1039</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: —that offices are not so frequently occupied by owner-occupiers, and space for expansion is available less frequently. I should be happy to include offices as well, if the Minister thinks that that would make it easier for him to accept the amendment. I wish that I could make the amendment as easy as possible for him to accept. He has given us no good reason for refusing it. He is going against the Sandilands Committee. He is going against many representations, including some from his hon. Friends, and he is going against what the Chancellor said in principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have debated the matter long enough, and I hope that my hon. and right hon. Friends will support me in putting the matter to the vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Cartwright</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak, basically, because I have been stung into rising by the comments of the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury). Although I do not in any sense represent the Co-operative movement in the Committee, my association goes back, as the hon. Member knows, a long way. Indeed, the organisation with which he has been associated and that with which I was associated compete over a substantial area of South-East London and the Home Counties, and the organisation with which I was associated does fairly well in that competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found myself emotionally understanding and supporting a good deal of what was said by Opposition Members, particularly the hon. Members for Hove, because a great deal of what he said I have heard in Co-operative circles and board rooms over a good many years. There is, I think a belief in the Co-operative Movement—my hon. Friend would do well to bear the point in mind—that Governments of all persuasions, but particularly Labour Governments, have shown some signs of discrimination against the retail trade. This has been clear on matters such as capital allowances, for example. It was abundantly clear on the selective employment tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not go along with the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) in his suggestion that the attitude of the Labour Party and the Labour Government toward commerce is influenced by the fact of trade union membership. Nveertheless, it appears that there are occasions when the Labour Party
	<span class='label label-info column'>1040</span>
gives the impression of being a producer oriented—organisation and a producer-dominated organisation, because of the involvement with the trade unions and of the way in which it has evolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I came into politics very much as a representative of a consumer movement. Therefore, I make no apology for arguing that on occasions the Labour Party and the Labour Government should pay more regard to the consumer and should be more sympathetic to the problems of retail trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in sympathy with the case which was made by the hon. Member opposite. On the other hand, my hon. Friend made some powrful arguments against these specific amendments which are before the Committee this afternoon. I find it hard to refute the argument that, in the present state of our nation, it is to manufacturing industry rather more than to commerce that we should look for assistance in promoting national recovery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the points which were made about the contributions that tourism can make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, I find it hard to accept that retail trade can make that same sort of contribution towards national recovery. Perhaps with the falling value of the pound it is possible that the number of tourists that are coming into this country to take advantage of our favourable exchange rate, will from their point of view, mean that retail trade will make a contribution to national recovery. It will be hard to argue that that is in any sense the sort of contribution we need or the sort that manufacturing industry makes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, my hon. Friend raised very considerable doubts in my mind, when he pointed out that opening the door to commerce, generally, was opening in a sense a Pandora's box. Had the amendments limited the discussion this afternoon to fairly defined areas, such as retail trade or tourism, they would have been harder to resist. I find hard to understand why offices are singled out for discrimination in the amendment. There is not much point in the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) saying that he singles offices out for discrimination, because offices are peopled by wicked bureaucrats employed by local government or by central Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a well known fact that the only possible way to prevent
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1127">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1041</span>
increases in the staff of local authorities, is by denying them office space.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cartwright</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem of local authorities is that people make increased demands on their services. That means increased staff, and that has the natural result that more offices are required. I felt that the argument put forward by the hon. Member for Hove on that point left a good deal to be desired. It would be hard to argue that there are not just as many useful organisations, and as many useful people working in offices, as there are working in shops, hotels, or in other aspects of commerce generally. I have it in mind—and the hon. Member for Hove will be able to bear out this point—that occasionally retail distribution has to occupy very substantial office space, in order to administer those parts of retail trade that require a substantial office staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remaining point made by my hon. Friend had a great deal of validity to it, when he argued that the provision of assistance under the original clause for manufacturing industry, does not necessarily of itself involve discrimination against commerce, or retail distribution. It does not discriminate in the sense of making life more difficult for those other aspects of our economy. It was argued on an earlier amendment associated with this group of amendments that, somehow, commerce, and particularly retail distribution, was in competition with manufacturing industry when it came to the use of resources. I find that a difficult argument</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1042</span>

	<p>to understand. It may be that when manufacturing industry, retail distribution, tourism, and any other commerce that one may think of are looking for investment capital they are competing one with another, but when it comes to land and employment I do not find that a convincing argument.</p>

	<p>When a major retail chain, for example, is deciding where to locate a major hypermarket, an out-of-town store or a supermarket, I do not think it will necessarily look to the sort of sites on which an industrialist would put major manufacturing capacity.</p>

	<p>In employment, it is not at all clear that manufacturing industry competes with commerce for the same kind of people. Indeed, that is the objection some of us had in the days of selective employment tax. It was argued that the shake-out of commerce by selective employment tax would somehow yield a substantial number of extra employees for manufacturing industry. It was not our experience in the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society that people who were shaken out of employment in shops dashed across the river to Ford and took jobs in the body shop of the Ford Motor Company.</p>

	<p>I take the point made by my hon. Friend, that although a considerable case can be made along the lines of the discrimination which is clearly felt in retail distribution, the needs of retail distribution would not be met by accepting these amendments.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:</p>

	<p>
	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 5.</p>

	<p>keep an informal discipline by keeping ourselves to a programme. I admit frankly that because of the very good debate today we are a little behind in that programme, and I hope that we shall be able to sit late one evening next week, perhaps till 10 p.m. or 10.30 p.m.</p>

	<p>Further consideration adjourned.—[
	<i>Mr. Denzil Davies.</i>]</p>

	<p>
	<i>Adjourned accordingly at one minute to Seven o'clock till Tuesday 11th May at half-past Ten o'clock.</i></p>
