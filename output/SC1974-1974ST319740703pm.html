	<div class='legislation'>DRAFT WEIGHTS AND MEASURES ACT 1963 (SUGAR) ORDER 1974</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>12 noon.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Prices and Consumer Protection (Mr. Alan Williams)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Committee have considered the draft instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I presume that in an atmosphere of reasonableness hon. Members will wish to approve the draft order. I hope that hon. Members have had copies of documents that we decided to make available because of the printing dispute. We were not sure whether the necessary documents would be available and so we have provided copies of correspondence and the Statutory Instruments Committee report so that hon. Members would have an opportunity to see, in advance, precisely what the main points of controversy would be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not a member of this Committee and that places me at a disadvantage. I appreciate the Minister's gesture of good will, but I wonder whether there is a spare copy available now so that I may catch up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, I am sure that we shall with the utmost good will provide the hon. Member with a library. I I shall be trying to touch on most of the points contained in the documents during my speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Sally Oppenheim</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members are at a considerable disadvantage, through no fault of the hon. Gentleman, because we have not received a report of the debate in another place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate in the other place, as the hon. Lady will know, was adjourned because certain papers were not available. The other place also wanted further consideration to be given to the recommendations of the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments. That is what the Government have under-
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
taken to arrange. I felt that it was better to put it to this House first so that hon Members would have the opportunity to consider the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the order is fairly clear. However, I suspect that our discussions may wander beyond the men parameters set by this order if hon Members are imaginative enough. The purpose is to allow the sale of pre-packed sugar in prescribed metric quantities, a: well as in prescribed Imperial quantities where those quantities are above 100 grammes and do not exceed 5 kilo grammes. Packages covered by the legislation down to the size of 50 grammes will have to have net weigh marked on the container.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members will know that the previous Government initiated the consultations on which the order is based. They are also probably aware that there were two rounds of consultations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Section 54(2) of the Weights and Measures Act 1963 there is a duty to consult, and more than 70 organisations were consulted. Those organisations have to be representative of interests substantially affectedâ€”that means consumer as well as industrial interests Bodies such as Age Concern, for example, were consulted, as were the main processors and those involved in distribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only must consultations take place and be reasonably exhaustive, but there is a duty for them to be considered. In fairness to the previous administration it should be said that because the consultations revealed dissatisfaction on the part of certain consumer interests at the lower ranges then provided in the initial draft order, that is, the lower ranges of sizes for prescribed packages, the initial order was withdrawn. After consultations with the trade, not only this order but the EEC Directive, were altered to take account of the issues raised by Age Concern and other bodies on behalf of consumers. The request was for a size below 250 grammes, which was in the original order and in the original EEC Directive. The trade accepted the requirement and the metric scale now goes down to 125 grammes, as prescribed in the order and in the EEC Directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0550">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
The order is necessary because, of course, we have to meet an EEC Directive, but we had to change the law relating to the sale of sugar in this country by 1st January 1975 so that sales of the pack sizes could be permitted here by 1st January 1976.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister now feel that the various bodies to whom he referred have been satisfied by the alterations? Have the criticisms now been met to their satisfaction?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To the best of my knowledge, that is so. If it were not, I should certainly have tried to accommodate them. I understand that the proposed order will meet the requirements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Oppenheim</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman make it clear whether the date of 1st January 1975 is in relation to the EEC Directive or to the order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The requirement under the EEC Directive is that member States amend their legal requirements by 1st January 1975 to enable the sale of the prescribed packs by 1st January 1976, which is what the order achieves. Therefore, the operative date of the order is 1st January 1976. We actually put it at 1st October, for technical reasons connected with the time of the sugar crop, to help the industry. The industry would have liked an even earlier date, but we did not feel that that would be a practical course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further reason why the order is necessary is that the industry itself is eager for the changeâ€”[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) may make sedentary interruptions as he wishes. The fact remains that for four years the industry itself and the Confederation of British Industry have been saying that they wanted the facility for metrification in respect of sugar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can only go on the advice that the Government have received in the consultations undertaken by my Department, under both this and the previous administration. The industry needs time in which to order plant, to instal it and actually to produce a stock of metric packs in time to meet the directed requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government take the view that it would be better for the consumer if only
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
one type of measure were used, and we hope, therefore, that from 1st January 1976 suppliesâ€”domestically provided and those importedâ€”will be in metric measure. It would be confusing to the housewife if there were prolonged periods in which the two types of pack were side by side on the shelves, because they are not identical in size.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members will be aware from their studies of Imperial and metric measures, the precise equivalent, ignoring decimal points, of the 1-lb. pack would be a 453 gramme pack. If we want to allow the housewife to make choice comparisons, we want relationships that are straightforward in the quantity on sale. Instead of switching to a 453 gramme absolute equivalent of the 1-lb. pack, it seemed logical to switch to the 500 gramme pack so that direct and clear arithmetical relationships between the 500 and the 1,000 pack, or down the other way, as outlined in the order, could be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has asked for assurances from the industry that as the packs will be larger, no advantage will be taken when switching to larger packs to charge a higher unit price for sugar. We have had assurances from the trade that as the packs hold 10 per cent. more, it will be the industry's intention to alter the price only by that 10 per cent. On the present price scale, therefore, the 1-lb. pack new equivalent, that is, the 1 kilogram, which is 10 per cent. larger, would cost one penny more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Milne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May we clear up this point at this stage, because we might be dealing with a great number of complicated matters arising from this instrument over which we have no control, no matter how we discuss them or what decisions we make on them? Could the Minister clarify two main issues? First, in view of the EEC directive, we have no control over our decision in this matter. As from 1st January 1975, the provisions of this draft instrument come into effect whether or not we decide otherwise. Secondly, does this draft statutory instrument mean the complete elimination of the old system of weightâ€”pounds and ouncesâ€”in favour of metrication? Is that a decision over which we have control and upon which we shall be able to decide in this Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0551">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The EEC requirement is a change in the law by the end of this year. The actual directive in terms of the appearance on the shop shelves would not bite until 1st January 1976.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the absolute disappearance of the existing Imperial rangeâ€”I assume the hon. Gentleman referred to sugar not going beyond this orderâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Milne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am dealing with sugar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to help the hon. Gentleman and I hope that he is trying to help me. His question could have been interpreted as going far beyond the range covered by this order. I was trying to establish whether he was talking about packs of other items, or confining himself to sugar, which he did not specify in his initial question, as he will discover when he reads the record of these proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Milne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which we have not got.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot have a record of the proceedings while the proceedings are still going on; there is a degree of spontaneity which is not practically possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will bear in mind the representations that we have had from consumer groups about metrication generally, as well as in relation to sugar, suggesting that it would be confusing to the housewife if one had both packages side by side. Although there is a difference, the difference is so small, 10 per cent., that housewives could be confused about the comparative prices and deciding which was the better buy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, our intention is that eventually only one system of measurement will be used. This is inevitably because the industry, at its own wish, will be replacing or modifying existing plant so that it will produce for metric quantification. The Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments made a series of points and, in fairness to the Committee, we should deal with each.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the Committee rejected certain words in Article 3 of the order:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Sugar which is not pre-packed shall be sold by retail only by net weight."</p></blockquote>
as being ambiguous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This we find difficult to accept, because none of the Departmental recordsâ€”going back to the original use of these wordsâ€”
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
suggests that there has been any confusion in the past. Our key standard work of reference on the 1963 Act does not give any evidence or in any way suggest that there has been any difficulty of interpretation. These words were not commented on by any of the 70-plus organisations that took part in consultations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The words appear in several places in the parent Act and have caused no difficulty there. They were used by the previous administration when the pasta and salt orders were produced. Hon. Members will accept that the then Minister for Consumer Affairs is a man whose knowledge of technical law is widely respected on both sides of the House. The order which he presented for consultation and for acceptance by the House contained the same words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he now suggests that we should depart from precedent, we are in danger of throwing doubts on the validity of all previous legislation in which these words were used. As there has been no evidence whatsoever of confusion arising from those words, we feel that the Select Committee's contention is not substantiated by evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Committee said that it could not see the practical effect of a phrase in Article 4â€”
	<br><blockquote><p>"made up in or on a container for sale".</p></blockquote>
Section 58(1) of the 1963 Act defines a container and makes clear that the container may wholly or partly enclose goods and that "pre-packed" is made up in advance for retail sale "in or on a container". Therefore, in the event of containers not necessarily being fully enclosed in future, it is logical that we cover such a situation. As a container does not have to be a completely enveloping pack, we are allowing in the wording, as in the original Act, for the fact that someone may say that there is a loophole because they are only putting it on the container, not in a container. Therefore, this provision merely ensures that no loophole exists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Oppenheim</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must press the Minister. I have had the view expressed to me that a situation could arise whereby, as a result of a shortage of cardboard, goods were packed on a tray which was then enveloped in a shrink pack provided by cellophane companies. However, I cannot see how it will be possible to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0552">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
pack sugar in this way, for one small perforation would let the sugar out. Furthermore, I cannot see how it is ever likely to be possible to pack sugar on a container.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would ask the hon. Lady what she thinks we should do. The packaging industry has changed enormously within a short time. Would she want us, in the event of the sort of changes she envisages in the packaging of goods other than sugar, to leave what we consider to be a possible loophole by which consumers would be deprived of the protection of prescribed quantities? I am sure that she will accept that it is right that we should make this provision as totally encompassing as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that an inadvertent penalty could arise from the fact that the lowest Imperial weight is 12 ozs whereas on the scale the lowest metric weight is 125 grammes, namely, about 5lb. In discussions with the trade it emerged that in recent times the smallest pack of sugar that has been madeâ€”this was for speciality sugarsâ€”was 12 ozs. No. further packs of this size are being made not even for speciality sugars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, as the industry is about to go metric, and as imports will be in metric quantities, it seemed to us in meeting representations by those concerned that if a demand for small packages existed we should ensure that it was met. We felt that this point was fully covered by altering the metric scale. As from 1976 supplies will be in metric. We should therefore take the scales down to 125 grammes, namely, about Â¼lb.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further request was that there should be rough equivalents. In the explanatory memorandum, the Select Committee did not ask for precise equivalents. It wanted rough equivalents of the upper and lower limits of the order as set out in Article 5, namely, a 5 kilograms and a 100 kilograms measure. It also wanted a rough equivalent of the lower limit for marking quantities in containers, namely, 50 grammes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The suggestion that the equivalents should be rough rather than precise was sensible. To give precise equivalents would have necessitated going into multiple decimal points and would have been virtually incomprehensible to the average member of the general public. Therefore,
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
the rough equivalent seemed to be the better way of meeting the communication need that it was felt the explanatory memorandum in its original form did not meet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have re-written the explanatory memorandum. The new wording is laid down in one of the papers that we have distributed to hon. Members. Five kilogrammes appears as approximately 11 lbs. and 100 grammes appears as approximately 3Â½ozs., and 50 grammes appear as 1Â¾ozs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Redmond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The order contains no imperial equivalents. However, they are given in the letter that the Minister wrote to the Chairman of the Select Committee. Is he saying that this letter is part of the explanatory note?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am saying that the explanatory memorandum will be rewritten in an alternative form, which has been distributed to members of this Committee, encompassing all the points made by the Statutory Instruments Committee in its consideration of the Bill in relation to the explanatory memorandum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, therefore, to the rough equivalents to which I have referred, the precise words requested by the Statutory Instruments Committee have been inserted, namely,
	<br><blockquote><p>"â€¦and these provisions shall be replaced by this order."</p></blockquote>
It is to be hoped that the Committee will agree that it was right that the Department cancelled the original meeting of this Committee so as to take into account the representations made by the Statutory Instruments Committee, and that the Government have tried, where possible, to meet reasonably points that were, in themselves, reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.26 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Redmond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not a member of this Committee but, as I understand it, I am allowed to speak, if nothing else, such as voting and so on. I am a member of the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments, and I think the Minister was a little optimistic in his opening remarks if he thinks that we can accept all his explanations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the delay was due to the printing dispute. The Governmentâ€”I am not blaming the Minister personallyâ€”appear to have objected, so far
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0553">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
as I have been able to see from the proceedings of the Select Committee, to our saying that the order was not clear; yet, they were prepared to send us a memorandum, witnesses to be cross-examined and then a special letter from the Minister to the Chairman of the Select Committee trying to clarify the situation. So far as I can make out from reading the order today, there have been no changes in it since I saw it in the Select Committee and that is the main reason for my being here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not objecting to metrication. I have a reputation for being anti-metrication, which is not fair; I try to get some common sense into the process of going metric, which has always been my line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the three main objections that were raised in the Select Committee, with regard to Article 3 of the order about "sale by retail only by net weight", that point is not worth pressing in the light of the explanation given by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to Article 4, I think the idea of putting sugar on to a container is too ludicrous for words but, again, that is not worth pressing. But in Article 4(
	<i>a</i>)(i) and (ii) I think we are being ingenuous if we let it go through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The minimum quantity of sugar that can be sold in imperial measure is Â¾lb. The minimum quantity in metric is about Â¼lb. Apparently, the industry wants a metric pack of below 250 grammes, or Â½lb., which is fair enough. But why should those who are insisting on using the metric system, against the objection of some of their customers, prevent anyone else from producing an imperial pack for people who want to purchase in small quantities? I have in mind people, some of them like myself, and others a good deal older, who have not yet got used to the decimal currency, and are now being asked to face something entirely foreign to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that the people wanting to buy small packs of sugar would tend to be old-age pensioners, and they are the very people who are still confused today with new pence. My mother is 87 years old and she has great difficulty in dealing with anything less than one pound simply because she can
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
not get used to this new-fangled system. Yet another hardship will be thrown on people like her if we insist that the industry must produce nothing less than a lb. in imperial measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the industry says that it can sell the idea of metric measure to its customers and it can get away with it, it cannot object to having "Â¼lb." put into Article(
	<i>a</i>)(i). I hope the Government will look at this again, withdraw the order on that point alone, and insert "Â¼lb." at the beginning of that paragraph.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 5 has me totally confused. I appreciate that we cannot include precise imperial equivalents in Article 5 because they would run to six decimal places. But surely it is possible to enlarge on the explanatory note that is going out with this order to the general public, rather than rely on the memorandum that will be circulated to members of this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Government to take back this order, therefore, and extend the explanatory note, because the letter written by the Minister to the Chairman of the Select Committee and the memorandum are not going out to the general public who get this order and have to deal with it. It is not going out to the grocers in the High Streetâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I intervene? It is conceivable that having transposed myself from my absorption with the Consumer Credit Bill, I used the term "ex-planatory memorandum" which would apply in relation to a Bill, whereas I was referring to the explanatory note.

The order will then be reprinted containing the new explanatory note which we have indicated to the Chairmen of the hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redmond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If what we are doing is looking at an order which will be amended before it is carried into effect, I think the Minister has met my point. I had not realised that.

	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A point of order was raised and I shall answer it. We are considering the Draft Statutory Instrument, and it has an Explanatory Note at the back of it. The Minister has explained that the Explanatory Note in the order will be altered. We are considering the draft order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redmond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I raise a further point of order? What is the procedure? The Committee are considering a draft order which the Minister now says will be amended. This draft order has, I believe, to be carried on the Floor of the House, and the Question is put there. By the time the Question is put, will the new printed version be available to the Members of the House as opposed to members of this Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. May I point out that the information which the Minister supplied is in the form of correspondence, the opening sentence of which begins: "The report of your joint committee." If we are to have an explanatory memorandum which refers to reports which presumably are not part of the explanatory memorandum or, if they are, the whole of it will have to be redrafted, we have reached a very confusing situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. With respect to the technicalities, the Explanatory Note is not part of the order which the House approves or disapproves. The order is not being changed for the reasons I put forward, but the Explanatory Note is being changed. I should have liked to nut it to the Committee in its revised form as a single document if I had been able to do so. However, for reasons of time and printing, that has not been possible. Therefore, I have done what I though was the next best thing in making all the information available, with the indication that we hope that before the order is finally approved by the House the revised Explanatory Note will be attached to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Milne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. In the Explanatory Note we are dealing not with the Draft Statutory Instrument but with paragraphs 8 and 9 of Schedule 4 to the Weights and Measures Act 1963. Therefore, the excellent letter which contains a lot of detail has no real relationship to the Explanatory Note on the order as it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0555">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
stands. Nor has the Minister indicated the type of change that will eventuate after we have approved the Statutory Instrument iself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Strictly speaking, that is not a point of order. The question before the Committee is that this Draft Statutory Instrument as it now stands be considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redmond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I seem to have caused some confusion by raising points of order in the middle of my speech, we have cleared up one matter. I did accept, as the Minister recalls, that in Article 5 it would not be possible to include imperial equivalents because of running to six places of decimals. That is why I asked for it to go into the Explanatory Note, because we are not debating the Explanatory Note. However, on the hon. Gentleman's assurance, I can withdraw that objection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I still come back to what I said about Article 4(
	<i>a</i>)(i). To that extent, as I am asking the Minister to withdraw the order and put another measurement in paragraph 4(
	<i>a</i>)(ii), I should have thought that he could get the Explanatory Note printed properly and we could see it again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The movement to metrication can become an absolute hen's breakfast if we are not careful. If we are to have anomalies such as the 12 oz. and 125 grammes, the public will object very strongly. I ask the Minister, in order to save timeâ€”I believe industry wants this order put through quicklyâ€”to take it away, redraft it and then come back with it. We shall get it through quickly, certainly in plenty of time for its coming into operation on 1st October 1975.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.40 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should immediately declare a financial interest as I am employed by a sugar company, Manbre and Garton. I have declared that interest in the past and informed Governments and Parliaments of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore examined the order carefully to decide whether I should even come to speak to it. There seem to be considerable misapprehensions about the order, and so I felt it right that at leapt one voice from the industry should be heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
I make it clear immediately to the Committee that the industry does not want metrication. What happened was that the metrication order was put to the industry, which said that it would not be obstructive about it. No industry wants to spend Â£30,000 per refinery on altering its plant. The industry said that it would co-operate in consultations, and discuss the matter with the Government in the same way as any other law-abiding organisation would do and has done. But it is not fair to say, either in the House of Commons or in the other place, as the noble Lord, Lord Jacques said, that the industry actually wants metrication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The date for the coming into force of the order is 1st October 1975. From the refiners' point of view, it will be a very short period in which to carry out the conversion required. We all know that sugar is being sold in. British shops, and has been sold over the past few months, in metric weights. Equally, we know that that is illegal. But the Government, probably rightly, have exercised an element of judgment in the matter, simply because there is such a shortage of sugar here at present that to have precluded the sale of metric packs would have created difficulties for the housewife. I should be the last person to want to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the speed with which the Government are pushing the legislation has put the domestic industry into difficulties. Although the industry was consulted about the matter, it asked originally for a clear 18 months from the passing of the order to the operative date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman bear in mind that this is a permissive, not a mandatory, order? All it does is to allow the industry to sell in metric packs from the date laid down. We are not telling the industry that it must do so. Therefore the hon. Gentleman's argument about the short time span if it is valid, and I accept the hon. Gentleman's expertise in the matter, is a matter for the industry to decide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's point of view, as there are only three major refiners in this country, we shall get into an appalling situation if one, for example, starts selling sugar
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0556">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
in metric weights and the others do not. There has been mutual understanding among the three refiners that the matter should be dealt with in a corporate way. I take the Minister's point and I am certain that the industry will, but I should have thought that the Metrication Board would hardly be likely to take a happy view of that idea, if that is the Government's true intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry's biggest problem, of which I am sure the Minister has been made aware, is that there will be substantial over-capacity of cane refiners owing to the shortfall of raw sugar from abroad. While the industry would like to co-operate, it is unfair to ask it to do so at a time when there is such uncertainty. I make no stronger point than that I hope that the Minister will consult his hon. Friends, both in the Ministry of Agriculture and the Department of Industry, to see whether the reorganisation that has been hanging fire for so long cannot be speeded up. That would make it easier for the companies to decide which refinery was to stay open, and where money should be spent on modern plant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
October is not a convenient date for the industry. It means that the busiest time of year, the autumn, clashes with the changeover date. Although as an individual company we cannot see ourselves producing a metric pack before the summer of 1976, I am not sure that it would not be in the interests of the Government to consider whether an amended date might be more suitable. I suggest perhaps 1st May 1976. I believe that that date would be welcomed. That view was expressed in letters to the Department of Trade and Industry sent in June and October 1973, and reiterated at a meeting in May 1974. Therefore, the point has been clearly made, and there must be a good reason why it has not been taken on board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Despite what my hon. Friend said about the disinclination of the industry to "go metric", is it nevertheless not a fact that unless the industry has the order by the end of June, it will not be able to place orders for the necessary packaging machinery in time to cope with the beet harvest of 1975?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that, because a wholly new problem affects the
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
industry, in fact all industry. It has grown in the past few months. I shall not say that it is the fault of any Government, because it affects not just the sugar industry, but all industry. That problem is the lead time on orders for engineering equipment. Whereas 15 months was a practical period and one with which the industry agreed, it is now fair to say that that is rather too short a period. Perhaps in considering this matterâ€”and I should not have thought that they had very much to lose by allowing a rather longer periodâ€”the Government might take that into account. If the date could be pushed forward, that would be very helpful. If the hon. Gentleman would remember that the sugar industry is in a difficulty and wants assistance from the Government in terms of direction, he would make a great contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reiterate what I said earlier, that the industry is not against this order, but to say that it is for it is to be under a misapprehension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.46 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Janet Fookes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's co-operativeness, and I am feeling a little guilty about nagging him on this question of in or on a container. I followed his ingenious explanation with interest, and I accept that with other commodities he has a point, but I am blessed if I can see how sugar can be sold in anything but a container which wholly encloses it. Otherwise, it is not practical. I do not like being party to an order which on this point seems to be somewhat nonsensical, and I ask the hon. Gentleman if he will please consider it again?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.47 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Sally Oppenheim</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I view this order with the deepest misgivings. It appears to combine a number of consumer evils and not to have taken sufficient account of consumer interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One aspect of the presentation of this order for consideration by this Committee which I resent particularly is that it has all the characteristics of a shotgun wedding. We are asked to consider a controversial order in the context of being told that if we hinder its passage in any way and oppose it we shall cause severe hardship in the trade, for the reasons put admirably by my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0557">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
We accept that the industry has to be equipped, that it has been waiting to be equipped, that it has been messed about since October 1969 on this very issue, and that if it needs to equip for the date that the Minister has given it will need to order the machines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no wish to harm the industry or to cause it any hardship whatsoever, but a distinction must be made. It is not the industry that wants this legislation. The industry merely wants to know where it stands with regard to dates and it is misleading to represent in this Committee that the industry wants this order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be impractical for the Committee not to approve the order, because of the tussle that would result throughout the industry. That being so, it is clear to me that the whole process of consultation and consideration under the Weights and Measures Act takes far too long. The Minister referred to this in relation to a previous order. Because of the length of these consultationsâ€”I do not underestimate the need for consultationsâ€”the House is continually being put under pressure in considering these orders, and that cannot be in the interests of consumers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government could have taken steps to bring the order before a Committee and before the Joint Standing Committee on Statutory Instruments at an earlier date. I can suggest a number of measures that could have been sacrificed to make time available for that to be done, and the result would have been that consumers would have been better served.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that part of the reason for the delay is that the other place threw out the order. That fact has not yet been mentioned. We shall be in some uncertainty if a decision is not made fairly soon on dates or times.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Oppenheim</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that. That was a short delay compared with the delay that occurred in the first place as a result of the consultations that are statutorily provided for in the Weights and Measures Act. But even taking that into consideration, I do not see why the whole matter could not have been raised by the Government earlier in this Session of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
In the hectic rush to bring the order before the Committee and the House the Government have paid scant attention to the representations and recommendations of the consumer safeguard committee, the report of the Metrication Board, or to the problems that will face consumers during the period of transition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that formal consultations were set up under the Conservative Government, but I must make it clear to the Committee that this country was committed to metrication by the previous Labour Government entirely outside the context of the EEC, and that should be placed clearly on record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady accept that the only contributions by the Opposition at that time were made by the noble Lord St. Oswald when speaking from the Front Bench in the other place on behalf of the Conservative Opposition. The noble Lord completely supported the move to metrication. There was never any attempt by the Opposition at that time to raise the issue even as a debating matter. The hon. Lady cannot therefore say that the Conservative Party was reluctantly dragged along this path. It marched should to shoulder with the Labour Party, without any attempt to raise the many complex issues that existed. The Conservative Opposition left the Government of the day to identify and deal with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Oppenheim</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: After the hon. Gentleman's political intervention, I am bound to comment that this marching shoulder to shoulder might be a very good concept in today's circumstances but it is one which the Labour Party apparently does not accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to stray down the path of political bias in discussing this order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Graham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Coalition sugar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Oppenheim</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Coalition sugar is a good idea. I think that that is what we shall get.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The weights described in the orderâ€”and this is one of my chief objectionsâ€”are by no means the standard familiar weights that we have discussed on many occasions. When we speak of the advantages of standard prescribed quantities, we are certainly not referring to such
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0558">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
quantities as 12 oz. or 2Â·5 kilograms. I am reminded of how the Minister of State, when in Opposition, complained frequently, and quite rightly, about the 12 oz. jar of jam, yet we are perpetuating that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that there was one manufacturer in the country who prepacked in 12 ozs. The Minister has told us that this is no longer the case, and that no one in this country is using 12 oz. packs. Therefore, why include this in the order? Why perpetuate an anomaly and include in the order a weight which is not standard or commonly used in this country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason is that although the trade assures us that production has stopped, we cannot be absolutely sure that there are no stocks in the pipeline. We should not want to make it illegal to sell those stocks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Oppenheim</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the order does not come into effect until January 1975. I realise that 12 oz. was in the original provision, but to continue with it is unacceptable because it is perpetuating the 12 oz. jar of jam. If, every time we consider prescribed quantities, we include minority interests, we might as well abandon the idea of standard prescribed quantities being of any use to consumers. If these small minority interests are to be considered every time, the whole concept goes by the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is the divergence between what the Minister of State said and what his noble Friend Lord Jacques said in another place about the likely time span when both metric and imperial weights will be sold. The noble Lord said that as sugar had a long shelf-life it would be sold for an indefinite period in both metric and imperial weights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the difficulties involved in terminating this transitional period, particularly for goods with a long shelf-life, but I do not accept that a final date should not be prescribed now. The Government know that in not doing so they are flouting the recommendations of the consumer sector of our committee, and those recommendations have a sound basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not suggesting that the termination date should be hurried; I am merely saying that a termination date should be given at the same time as the order is introduced. The Minister is aware that
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
in another place Lord Jacques said that it would not come in for some considerable time and that both metric and imperial weights would appear on the shelves for a number of practical reasons. This is at variance with what was said by the Minister. The hon. Gentleman was obviously taking account of the views that have been expressed on a number of occasions by consumer organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Jacques also said that a further regulation would be made so that both a metric and an imperial weight would be shown. The imperial weight will be shown as a fraction. This will be extremely misleading to consumers, and it will lead them to make comparisons with an unfamiliar unit of weight. I do not think this will help at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that there are consumer safeguards which the committee recommended, but here I part company with the committee. I do not claim greater expertise, but I believe that the practical difficulties are very great indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Metrication Board in its annual report stressed the importance of helping shoppers during the change to the metric system. In particular, the board stressed the need to help people to continue to judge value for moneyâ€”especially in relation to foodâ€”but no proivsion has been made, nor has anyone undertaken to help consumers during this difficult transitional period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sugar is a standard product. Therefore it is, perhaps, an ideal commodity for initial metrication, but it also goes into every home. It is extremely important that consumers should not be confused about the value of what they are receiving. The mind boggles when one thinks of the difficulty that will face consumers when they are confronted with 2Â·5 kilogramme packs, the imperial translation of which would be approximately 5Â·4 lbs. How are people to judge values if they are confronted with this type of pre-packaging?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was concerned to learn that in another place Lord Jacques said that he doubted whether unit pricing would be necessary during the transitional period. I think that it is absolutely essential. I believe it to be essential to the final approval of this order that the Minister should give an undertaking that he will bring in unit pricing regulations during the transitional period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0559">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
I believe that sugar, when sold by metric weight, should carry not an imperial unit price, but a unit price in relation to the imperial weight. As a result, the unit price would be on the package. One would have the kilogramme package, the price per kilogramme and then an imperial unit price. For example, if a consumer is currently paying 9p a lb., he can see whether it is still 9p a lb. or whether it has changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trade have given an undertaking that it will not raise the price 
	<i>pro rata,</i> and we accept this undertaking, but we do not know what will happen if sugar falls into the hands of a minority of unscrupulous traders who could possibly take advantage of the confusion that is inevitable as far as the consumer is concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the fact that Tate and Lyle has agreed to make available one whole side of its packaging, which is valuable advertising space, for the provision of information to consumers about this matter. That is a generous gesture on the company's part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>It being One o'clock,</i> THE CHAIRMAN, 
	<i>pursuant to Standing Order No. 64 (Meetings of Standing Committees), deferred adjourning the Committee.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Oppenheim</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still maintain that the Government have provided no adequate safeguards for consumers in the order. I submit that unit pricing is essential. We have accepted the, valuable information given to us, the critcisms and suggested amendments made by the Joint Select Committee. I do not think that they have been adequately dealt with. I consider that valid and valuable comments could have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not regard those comments, however, as the main objection to the order itself. Furthermore, I understand that the Minister has said that he envisages that sugar will be packed on a tray in future. I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would give us further details about that. I do not see how that method could be applied in practice. We are talking about a sugar order. If the Minister cannot envisage that the idea would be carried out, why it is included in the order at all?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition do not intend to oppose the order at this stage if the
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
Minister will give adequate undertakings on the subject of unit pricing regulations. However, in not opposing the order I should like it placed clearly on the record that we do not approve of it. I believe that consumer interests will be severely and adversely affected if the order is passed as drafted.

The Opposition have been put into an impossible position in having to consider the order under great pressure, knowing that it will cause severe hardship to the trade. It is with great reluctance that we accept the order, provided that the Minister will give us assurances about unit pricing regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the hon. Lady has so little confidence in the way in which her colleague, the previous Minister for Consumer Affairs, looked after the interests of consumers. It must be clearly understood that the order is based on his draft orders and consultations. The Opposition cannot dissociate themselves from responsibility for the order virtually as now laid before them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Oppenheim</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not know what safeguards my right hon. and learned Friend would have introduced at the same time as the order. The hon. Gentleman will remember that we had in view passing a Bill at that time which might have come in in time to be used in dealing with the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not responsible for the fact that the hon. Lady's party threw away consumer protection legislation by calling a premature election. That was why the unit pricing legislation did not exist, and it would probably not have been law now. If the hon. Lady will be patient, I shall cline to the matter in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise to the hon. Member for Bolton, West (Mr. Redmond) for confusing him with my explanatory memoranda as opposed to explanatory notes. I think that the hon. Gentleman has now been reassured by the equivalents that we shall now put into the explanatory note, and by the form of words which, although not precisely those suggested by the Committee, will achieve the objectives required by the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman went on to talk about Article 4 (
	<i>a</i>)(ii). I understand his concern. The hon. Gentleman wanted
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0560">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
smaller packs, made possible under the Imperial range, than the 12-oz minimum. The industry did not want the smaller quantities. It indicated that even if power to close existed in the order, it would not have been its intention to produce packs containing those smaller quantities prior to going over to the metric system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More importantly for the Committeeâ€”I know that Committee members want to study the consumers' interestsâ€”it was the consumer organisations that asked for the smaller metric measures. They did not ask for smaller Imperial measures. We have met the consumer organisations' requirements, therefore, Age Concern being one of the organisations consulted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redmond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the Minister's point that he consulted the industry as it exists now. But if, for example, I decided that there was a market for small imperial packs of sugar to suit the old-age pensioner market and I wanted to go into business packing sugar into Â¼lb. bags to meet that demandâ€”out of sympathy for elderly people unable to follow metric systemâ€”as this order stands I would not be allowed to do so. That is my point. It is not what the existing industry wants. I was referring to the whole distributive industry which will be forbidden to sell small imperial packs. It will not make a great deal of difference if the Minister puts in the smaller imperial equivalents. It will not upset anybody and it can do a great deal of good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not prevented from doing so until 1st October 1975, so if he wants to go into his garden shed with his little ladle and make up his 4 oz. packs he is free to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Redmond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no future in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: From that date on, with his ingenuity, he will be able to cope with 125 grammes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the sizes in this order were cleared with the consumer organisations. I give that assurance to the Committee because I know that is where the major concern lies. The Metrication Board has just started a Press campaign in order to protect the consumer, and ensure the consumer is aware of what metrication will mean. That is the Press campaign
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
for which a budget was refused by the previous Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady will be fully aware that I do not have the power to guarantee that there will be unit pricing because the Prices Bill is not yet legislation. As far as I am concerned, if unit pricing will help in the changeover, then there will be unit pricing. That is also the view of my right hon. Friend. But as yet we do not have the legislation under which we can make the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady will have to accept that we are not at a stage where we can rule by edict, and I would not want to see such a stage. Therefore, we must wait until Parliament gives us the power to do the things which the hon. lady wants. I trust that the Prices Bill will in future have her enthusiastic support, as no doubt it has had in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Oppenheim</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman well knows that we did not oppose the Prices Bill, partly because it contained pricing provisions. Would he therefore give a clear undertaking that if the Prices Bill is enacted, and he has these powers, he will use them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the consumer bodies want unit pricing, as far as this product is concerned, I will see that they have unit pricing, once we have the power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) said the industry does not want metrication. But it is the British Sugar Refiners Associationâ€”the firm with which the hon. Gentleman is associated is a member of that Associationâ€”which has written to officials and to Ministers regularly since 1970 asking to be allowed to sell in metric quantities. That seems to me to be an indication that they wish to go metric.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there is a difficulty about the date. But again, the industry has said that there is no date that would be suitable for everyone. The date of 1st October was particularly requested by Tate and Lyle, which supplies 60 per cent. of the market, and that date, therefore meets a major requirement. The British Sugar Corporation is willing to try, though it would have preferred the earlier date of 1st July. So we have tried to take on board the various representations from the industry itself.

The hon. Lady the Member for Plymouth, Drake (Miss Fookes) dealt with the question of containers. It was the previous Minister responsible for consumer affairs who said that consumer legislation had to be flexible to meet changing circumstances. We are engaged in considering another Bill which is the essence of rubbery flexibility in its ability to adapt to meet the requirements of the day. As we cannot be sure what will happen at retail level in future, it seems reasonable that we should cover the contingency. Perhaps it never will, but if the contingency arises, it is now covered.

The hon. Lady the Member for Gloucester (Mrs. Oppenheim) and I have exchanged arguments for far too long for either of us to be upset by what the other has to say. However, I wish she would not exchange arguments with herself; it confuses me. On the one hand she piously demanded that the order should have come earlier, and then complained that we were in a frantic rush to get it through. The hon. Lady must decide which horse she intends to ride.

	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
The order could have been here earlier if the unfortunate political eventâ€”from the point of view of the Conservative Partyâ€”to which I referred earlier had not taken place. The previous Government would have been able to bring it forward very rapidly. However, she will accept that the incoming Government have a right to decide whether they wish to pick up every piece of legislation that is left by their predecessors. As we have chosen to pick up this and as it was left by our predecessors, I trust that it will be received with an unusual degree of unanimity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Oppenheim</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the horse I am riding is the winner. The Government have chosen to pick up the order too late for it to be adequately considered. It is the Government's responsibility for leaving it so late.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
