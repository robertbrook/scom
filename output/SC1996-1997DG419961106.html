	<div class='title'>Draft Channel 4 (Application of Excess Revenues) Order 1996</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of National Heritage (Mr. Iain Sproat)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Channel 4 (Application of Excess Revenues) Order 1996.</p></blockquote>
The order honours the commitment given by my noble Friend, Lord Inglewood, at Report stage of the Broadcasting Bill in the other place on 7 March, to end Channel 4's compulsory payments into its statutory reserve at the earliest parliamentary opportunity. The draft order is made under section 27(7) of the Broadcasting Act 1990 as amended by section 83(4) of the Broadcasting Act 1996. It will reduce from 25 per cent. to nil the percentage of excess revenues that Channel 4 must pay into the reserve under the provisions of the Channel 4 funding formula set out in the 1990 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the terms of the 1990 Act, Channel 4 is guaranteed funding from the channel 3 companies should its income from advertising fall below 14 per cent. of total national television advertising revenues. To date, that has not happened, and Channel 4's income is currently 21 per cent. of advertising revenues. The 1990 Act, however, also provides that if Channel 4's income from advertising rises above the 14 per cent. threshold, then the excess revenue above that threshold must be distributed according to arrangements also specified in the 1990 Act. Some 50 per cent. of that excess goes to the Independent Television Commission for onward distribution to the channel 3 companies, 25 per cent. goes to a statutory reserve fund held by Channel 4 and 25 per cent. can be added to Channel 4's current expenditure plans. Should Channel 4's income fall below the 14 per cent. threshold, however, the funds which have accrued in the statutory reserve are its first recourse to make good the shortfall in funding. If and when the funds in the reserve are exhausted, it is for the channel 3 companies to make up the shortfall between Channel 4's income and the 14 per cent. threshold. The liability of the channel 3 companies is, however, limited to 2 per cent. of total national advertising revenue in any one year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The funding formula was introduced by the 1990 Act as part of new arrangements whereby Channel 4 was to sell its own advertising rather than rely on financing from the channel 3 companies. Prior to the 1990 Act, Channel 4 had been financed by a subscription from the ITV companies which sold Channel 4's advertising airtime. The funding formula
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
was a safety net, because it was feared that the new arrangements might not provide Channel 4 with sufficient income properly to fulfil its remit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the passage of the Broadcasting Bill earlier this year, there were calls to abolish the Channel 4 funding formula. Many, including Channel 4 itself, believed that, in the light of the success that Channel 4 has enjoyed since it began selling its own advertising, the financial safety net was no longer required and the payments being made by Channel 4 to the ITV companies should be ploughed back into the channel's programme production. The Government were not wholly persuaded by those arguments. It was accordingly decided to retain the basic framework of the funding formula, but to take steps to increase the level of income that Channel 4 could retain without putting on reserve. The Broadcasting Act 1996, therefore, introduced the power to adjust by order the distribution of Channel 4's excess revenues above the statutory threshold of 14 per cent. of television advertising revenues. The level of funds in the statutory reserve, which stood at £84.8 million on 31 December 1995, is sufficient to cover any conceivable shortfall in income in the immediate future. To that end, we have tabled the order, which removes the requirement for Channel 4 to make any payment into its reserve, and thereby doubles at a stroke the proportion of advertising revenue above the threshold level that Channel 4 is able to retain for expenditure on current plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have long made it clear that we intend to amend the proportion of any such surplus which goes to channel 3 companies. However, as we stated during the passage of the 1996 Broadcasting Bill, the provisions of the Broadcasting Act 1990 did not permit any change in the financial equilibrium between channel 3 and Channel 4 under the funding formula before the end of 1997. As it was on that basis that the channel 3 companies bid for their franchises, we are not willing to make any change to the operation of that relationship before 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble Friend Lord Inglewood also announced, during the passage of the Bill through the other place, the general lines on which we propose to use the new power in respect of payments to channel 3 companies. We would reduce the payments from Channel 4 to the channel 3 companies from their current level of 50 per cent. of Channel 4's excess income above the 14 per cent. threshold. Those changes are to be in two stages, taking effect from 1998 and 1999 respectively. We said that the Government intended to make decisions on the exact changes to the percentages in the formula nearer 1998. That remains the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order will enable Channel 4 to spend many more millions of pounds each year on programming. It fulfils a specific undertaking to Parliament, which was widely welcomed on both sides in both Houses. I commend the order to the committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.36 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis Moonie 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kirkcaldy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Minister on a successful rearguard action in avoiding inclusion of the privatisation of Channel 4 in the Queen's Speech—a matter that was welcomed by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0335">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Opposition and, I suspect, by most of his hon. Friends. It seems like old times being back in Committee after the Broadcasting Bill earlier this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made no secret of the fact that we are 100 per cent. in support of the order. I should have liked the Minister to say what discussions, if any, his Department has had with Channel 4 and on what the money will be spent. The matter was debated at length in Committee and hon. Members in all parts of the House said that we would like some earnest from Channel 4 and more details of where the vast increase in its spending budget will go. That is a minor point compared with the fact that it is high time that the anomaly was sorted out. We are pleased to see that that has been done and we support the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.37 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Great Grimsby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was a little confused by the Minister's opening statement, which is not unusual for me. He seemed to be saying that the Government intend to do one thing, have provided for doing something else, and will probably do a third thing, but will do nothing until the end of 1997. That left me flabbergasted. The matter will be left to us because from 2 May next year there will be a Labour Government who will abandon all the silly ideas of privatising Channel 4. I presume that the measure is being introduced now and in such an equivocal way because of the avowal of the Government's belief that it is not possible in the time remaining to them to carry out the act of vandalism that was being considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To provide that revenue generated by Channel 4 can be kept by Channel 4 for Channel 4 productions will make it less saleable. To privatise Channel 4 would oblige it to pay dividends to shareholders and it would be impossible for it to do that while maintaining current expenditure on programming. That is why the measure is welcomed by the tumultuous forces of the Opposition in the Committee. It will achieve the objective that we have in common and which will be denied by privatization—to allow Channel 4 to retain more revenue to spend on programmes. That is important and it must be emphasised that the desirable goal is to do it in that way because Channel 4 is the only television organisation in this country which gives a fair deal to independent producers—which the Government have supposedly dedicated themselves to encouraging—who do not get a fair deal from the BBC, which is too bureaucratic to take their ideas. The BBC sends a standard form to independent producers who submit ideas for programmes which say, "Thank you for your idea. We aren't using it because we can't fit it in. But if, by the way, you find an idea similar to yours or exactly the same as yours appearing in a BBC programme it is because great minds think alike. We will have thought of it ourselves."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a monstrous approach. The BBC is not giving the fair deal that the measure—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am a little anxious in case the hon. Gentleman incites the Minister to stray too wide of the terms of reference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am emphasising that the extra revenue that the order will make available to Channel 4 to spend on programmes will be wisely spent because Channel 4 gives a fair deal to independent producers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Gale 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman is so concerned about independent production, I wonder whether he might use his undoubted influence to persuade Mr. Rupert Murdoch to invest more in independent United Kingdom production?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Rupert Murdoch is beginning his independent United Kingdom production. Indeed, I play a major part in it—perhaps the major part. However, I know that you, Sir James, will not want me to expand on that subject. The hon. Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale) obviously wants me to praise the political programme which the good Lord Tebbit and I do for Rupert Murdoch and which marks the beginning of massive expenditure from the Murdoch channels on programme production in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful that Channel 4 will have more revenue to spend on independent production because it does not get a fair deal from ITV, which has moved most of its independent production to companies in which it has a stake or control, or from Channel 5, which also tends to use preferred companies. Those companies do not use independent production to obtain a variety of ideas, but to achieve cut-price production through organisations set up off the main studios. Those organisations use fewer staff, who are less well paid, to produce cheaper programmes, instead of encouraging a flourishing undergrowth of independent producers—the intention of the Government and the Opposition. Those independent producers are well served by Channel 4 and will be better served by the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the Minister on seeing sense and, it appears, on abandoning the crazed, demented intention of privatising Channel 4, which would have inflicted a grievous wound on television production in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.43 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Stephen 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Shoreham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also support the order. I, too, would have liked more detail on what Channel 4 proposes to spend the extra money on. The directors of Channel 4, in common with the directors of all our television channels, need to understand that they are the custodians of the most powerful medium ever invented for changing attitudes and moulding ideas. They do not simply reflect society; to a large extent, they create society's attitudes. Many of my hon. Friends and I, and Opposition Members, have been concerned for several years about the standard of programming on Channel 4 and other channels, especially the portrayal of sex and violence. If people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0336">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
with low standards of personal behaviour are depicted on our television sets day after day, night after night, week after week, it is not surprising that other people, especially the more vulnerable in our community, imitate them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the directors of Channel 4 to understand the grave responsibilities that rest on their shoulders, to have regard to the effect that their programmes have on the community around them and to spend the money wisely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. In my impetuous enthusiasm for the Government's measure, I did not declare a possible interest—and it is always wise to declare an interest when in doubt. My wife is an independent producer, and I have been praising independent producers. I have no involvement in production for Rupert Murdoch—I merely do a programme for him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether that is a point of order, but it will be noted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>

	<p>4.44 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to thank the hon. Members for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) and for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) for their kind congratulations. I deserve no congratulations on keeping privatisation out of the Queen's Speech, but in the world of politics—where one gets kicked for things that one has not done—one may as well occasionally accept praise for things that one has not done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Kirkcaldy and for Great Grimsby and my hon. Friend the Member for Shoreham (Mr. Stephen) referred to the new spending. Channel 4 has said publicly that the bulk of the new money—the 25 per cent. which prior to this order had to be put on reserve, but which can now be spent on current expenditure—will go on new British production. Of course, it is up to Channel 4 to decide how that money should be spent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
