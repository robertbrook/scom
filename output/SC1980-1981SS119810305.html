	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is an error on the Notice Paper. It seems to be a regular duty of the Chair in this Committee to make apologies. I do not know how the error happened, but the Committee on 3 March certainly did not approve of the motion concerning the order in which the clauses and schedules are to be debated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay, May I first sympathise with you over the impossible situation that you were put in on Tuesday by the tyrannical Whip who conducts the Government's business, who cut short the eloquent speech of my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) by moving the closure. In no sense do I question your right, Mr. Gourlay, to accept a closure motion. What worries me is that the Government Whip should rise to move it in the middle of a speech by an hon. Member. If one of the Government Whip's hon. Friends should by some mischance make a contribution during the next three or four months of the Committee stage, the hon. Gentleman could also rise in the middle of that speech and move the closure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that closures have to be moved and accepted, Mr. Gourlay, but do you agree that it is not acceptable practice for the Government Whip to move the closure in the middle of an hon. Member's speech, on that occasion cutting short what would obviously have been an excellent and meaningful contribution to our debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not really a point of order, in some ways it could almost be regarded as a challenge to the Chair, although the hon. Gentleman tried to say that it was not. Everything that happened on Tuesday was in order, and since it was in order there can be no point of order about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Is it possible to have it recorded that the Opposition protest over what can be described only as the aristocratic thuggery of the Government Whip?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not prepared to accept a bogus point of order, and that is obviously what the hon. Gentleman has raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O'Neill 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether this is a point of order, but I seek your guidance, Mr. Gourlay. Could you explain to us the criteria on which you based your decision on Tuesday, so that in future debates we shall be able to understand? As my hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grange mouth (Mr. Ewing) said, my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) was in mid- flight or just rising when—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This, too, is not a point of order. I have the discretion as to when I accept a closure motion. It is not the practice of the Chair to indicate beforehand or hypothetically how it will rule on acceptance of a closure motion. The general rule is that when the Chair considers that a motion has been adequately debated it accepts the closure motion. What is regarded as adequate is always at the discretion of the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie RoSS 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a different point of order, Mr. Gourlay. One of the matters that we were discussing was hon. Members' difficulty in attending the Committee. When my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) was about to make some points about that, the closure motion was moved. Had my hon. Friend been allowed to proceed, a closure motion might well not have been moved. Would it not be in order now—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is raising hypothetical matters. The Chair ruled on Tuesday by accepting the closure motion; there can be no discussion of that decision, by whatever means the hon. Gentleman tries to raise it. Any such discussion initiated by points of order is technically a challenge to the ruling of the Chair, which cannot be tolerated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May we proceed to the motion on the order of consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i></p>

	<p>That the Bill be considered in the following order: Clause 1; Schedule 1; Clauses 2 to 4; Schedules 2 and 3; Clause 5; Schedule 4; Clauses 6 to 14; Schedule 5; Clause 15; Schedule 6; Clauses 16 to 20; Schedules 7 to 9; Clause 21; new Clauses; new Schedules.—
	<i>[Mr. Alexander Fletcher]</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are several points which we must raise, I know that, roughly speaking, we seem to be taking the clauses in numerical order, starting with clause 1 and debating the appropriate schedules as well. It appears to me that there are many contentious issues in the Bill, and it would be better if the non-contentious parts—if any—were considered first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we discuss clause 1 and then schedule 1, as the Government are proposing, the many bodies which are interested in the provisions of clause 1 and which have made representations to us about it and schedule 1 will be limited in their opportunities to finalise their consultations with us. The Committee should have some regard to whether the order proposed by the Government is in the best interests of that consultative procedure and the interests of those outside the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government proposal is to begin the debate today on the so-called parents' charter. The Opposition have made it clear that we are not opposed in principle to parental choice, but there are signs of great concern among practically all local authorities in Scotland, and 
	<i>the</i> Convention of Scottish
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0028">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
Local Authorities is seriously concerned, about some of the extremely difficult administrative procedures which the Government are proposing. My hon. Friends and I recently met some representatives of COSLA, and it was clear that they were strongly opposed to certain aspects of the Government's scheme. I think that the Minister knew of this likelihood even before the Bill was published because he had also had deliberations with representatives of COSLA. So it appears rather strange that he seems to be diving in at the deep end here, asking us to debate clause 1 and schedule - at the very start of the Committee stage, rather than taking some of the other clauses first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A change in the order of consideration would give the local education authorities far more time to make representations to us. A great deal of new information is still being collected about the status quo in parental choice. It is nonsense to imagine that there is no parental choice at all at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have been listening with some care to the hon. Member's submission. The Question before the Committee is that the Bill be considered in a certain order. The normal order would be to take clause 1 and proceed through the Bill in numerical order. The reason for the change which is proposed—and the only reason which can be adduced for changing the normal order—is to suit the convenience of the Committee in relating the clauses to the schedules. The normal order of considering the Bill is certainly not changed to suit the convenience of hon. Members having discussions with outside bodies or of outside bodies making representations. So this debate is restricted and confined. If the hon. Gentleman will address himself to that aspect he will be in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Schedule 1 is to be taken immediately after clause 1 under the Government proposal, but I submit that we should delay discussion of schedule 1 until nearer the end of the Committee stage. I can remember the representations that were made to us about schedule 1 by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. Paragraph 5 of schedule 1 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A person shall not be a member of an appeal committee for the consideration of a reference of a decision if he was among those who made the decision or took part in discussions as to whether the decision should be made."</p></blockquote>
I know that there is great concern about that aspect of the Bill, particularly in Strathclyde region.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I thought that I had made clear to the Committee including the hon. Gentleman, the narrowness of this debate. He is going on to matters which are irrelevant at present. It is proposed to take schedule 1 before its normal place because it has an alliance with clause 1. We cannot change clause 1 to be considered at the end, because clause 1 is the first clause in the Bill. It may be argued this morning that it may be in the interests of the Committee to bring forward schedule 1—or some of the other schedules—but certainly the hon. Gentleman's argument cannot be adduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Gourlay, for your guidance. What I am suggesting is that the motion should be changed so that schedule 1 can be taken at a later stage of the Committee's proceedings rather than at an earlier stage. The reason is the extreme legal difficulties which may arise if the Bill is passed as it stands. If at an early stage it is decided that schedule 1 should remain part of the Bill, because we rush through, this will present difficulties for educational authorities, particularly in Strathclyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister represents a constituency in Lothian region, and it has been said that this part of the Bill is simply for Lothian. I would go even further and say that it is a Bill for a minority of parents in the City of Edinburgh, who seem to be obsessed about which school their children should or should not attend. There will be extreme legal difficulties as a result of schedule 1 if we go ahead. We could reach it later on today or early next week, and I should not like us to be seen to be rushing through in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We ought also to be aware that we should give the maximum opportunity for the Government's legal advisers to contribute to the debate. I can see considerable legal complexity, particularly in schedule 1. That is why discussion of that schedule should be postponed until we have an assurance that at least one of the Law Officers will be able to come to the Committee. Standing Order 63 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Attorney General, the Lord Advocate, Mr. Solicitor General and Mr. Solicitor General for Scotland, being Members of this House, or any of them, though not members of a standing committee, may take part in the deliberations of the committee, but shall not vote or make any motion or move any amendment or be counted in the quorum."</p></blockquote>
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lord Advocate is not a Member of this House, so we cannot have the advantage, or disadvantage, of his attendance to guide us in the Committee. But the Solicitor-General for Scotland is a Member of this House, and we ought to hear his views on schedule 1. There seems to be doubt among the legal advisers to the local authorities about whether, for example, paragraph 5 of schedule 1 would exclude, in the case of Strathclyde, members of the schools councils. They would make a valuable contribution on any appeal committee, yet it appears that in Strathclyde the schools councils decide in the first instance on placing requests. If the good people on the schools councils in Strathclyde are to be disqualified from membership of the appeal committee, their breadth of experience will not be used by the Government and they will have no opportunity to take part in administering the appeals procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that this is a legal point and that the Bill may still allow these people to be on the appeal committee. But, in view of what can only be des cribed as the legal complexities and confusion of the Bill, we should postpone discussion on schedule 1 until we can hear what the Solicitor-General has to say about it. We know that he is a busy man. He has the Crown Office to look after—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0029">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is going wide of the motion. His point could easily refer to every clause and schedule. Therefore, he would be completely out of order to go on at length about the Solicitor-General for Scotland. He has requested the Solicitor-General's attendance here, but I am not prepared to allow the Committee to go into the qualities of the Solicitor-General or any of the other Law Officers who might be in attendance at the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:Thank you, Mr. Gourlay. Your guidance is helpful, as always, but may I just finish this point. The Solicitor-General for Scotland is a busy man, and may have difficulty in getting here by 10.30 am.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have noticed a tendency among hon. Members, once the Chair has ruled, to continue with their speeches in the same manner as before. I hope that my rulings will be observed in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Gourlay, for your guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be an advantage to have legal advice on these particularly difficult parts of the Bill, and I should like to see them left to the end. I know that it is standard procedure to go through a Bill in sequential order, but in view of the difficulties, and the fact that we should require the advice of the Law Officers, the Minister should move to adjourn the Committee today, have another look at this motion, and put some of the fairly non-controversial parts of the Bill first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, we could start by discussing clause 17 instead of clause 1. Clause 17 is reasonably non-contentious, in that it just takes power away from the Queen and transfers that power to the university courts of St. Andrews, Glasgow, and Aberdeen University. I am sure that there would be no disagreement on either side about that, and I understand that the Queen herself has given her consent—probably because she is fed up with appointing the principals. She has more to do than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we started with clause 17 instead of clause 1 we should have the opportunity of dealing with something non-contentious, so that the Minister would not have too difficult a job. It would be in his own interests to try to begin with something easy, so I advise the Minister to consider moving a new motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to continue in the conciliatory tone of my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan). I certainly feel that we should start with the easy bits—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not pull up the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) in his final remarks, but he was out of order. The order in which we consider the Bill is not to be decided according to whether an item is contentious or otherwise. I have already stated the criteria. Whether some hon. Members find some clauses less contentious than others is no criterion for determining the order in which the Bill is debated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our concern about the first schedule has been touched on by my hon. Friend. We feel that the relationship between clause 1 and the first schedule will create a great deal of difficulty, which the Minister and his advisers may not have appreciated. I do not wish to stray into the substantive matter of the clause, but if the parents' charter is to operate there needs to be an appeal system, and the appeal system is laid out in some detail in schedule 1. We think that schedule 1 has certain deficiences and problems, and that it would not be helpful to discuss it in the suggested order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are serious legal difficulties when bodies that are not elected take power away from bodies that are elected. An education committee in some areas is to have its power to consider appeals with drawn and given to bodies appointed, perhaps by the education committee. Secondly, we feel that there is a grave deficiency in the schedule—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is arguing a case which should be advanced on the schedule, either by amendment or in the debate on the motion that it be the first schedule to the Bill. The hon. Member is not in order in discussing it at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to go down roads which you would like to have closed, Mr. Gourlay, if you feel they are out of order. But our point is that it would not be helpful at this stage, even if we get through clause 1, then to embark on the schedule. We feel that the two are not sufficiently closely related, and that that would inhibit us from a serious consideration of what is accepted as being one of the essential elements in the Bill. I was endeavouring, by illustration, to substantiate that case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that if the manner in which I presented these illustrations caused us to stray into a discussion of substantive matters, I should clearly be out of order, and I accept your ruling, Mr. Gourlay. I recognise that there are problems here, but I think that you will accept that what we are endeavouring to do, in the best interests of the Committee, is to arrive at a modus operandi which will enable us to handle the matter in the fairest and most expeditious way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may go on to a point concerning the schedule and the treatment of the first clause. Here I seek your guidance, Mr. Gourlay. Since the Bill is endeavouring to amend the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, and that Act is a fairly substantial piece of legislation covering virtually everything in Scottish education, when we are trying to amend section 28 in a way which adds to the section—it is more of an addendum than an amendment—we shall run into difficulties when we start going through 28A, 28B and so on. We should clear this up at the beginning, when we are discussing the order of consideration. This may not be the appropriate place for it to be raised, but it is important to clear it up. If 28A, 28B and 28C are to all intents and purposes clauses, in the sense that they deal with separate items, would it not have been preferable
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0030">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
to have had the clauses set out not as one massive clause 1—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman has raised an interesting point, but it is not relevant to the debate. We are not discussing the construction of clause 1; we are merely discussing whether schedule 1 should follow clause 1, which is an entirely different matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put it in this way, Mr. Gourlay. If we are to discuss schedule 1 we shall have to work our way through clause 1. We would like to ensure that before we start we have a clear idea—and I realise that your rulings, Mr. Gourlay, will enable us to have this clear idea—whether we shall be entitled or whether the Committee will have the opportunity, which is perhaps a better way of putting it, as we realise that it is not a question of our rights but is to a large extent the manner in which you ensure that our rights are available to us, given the construction of clause 1, to have more than one clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is posing a hypothetical question, one which certainly the Chair has not ruled on previously. All I can say is that the Bill has a clause 1 and a schedule 1, and the Committee will go through clause 1 in the normal manner, as in any Committee. These are the rules in the Standing Orders of the House, and I have no authority to depart from them, until I am instructed to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Gourlay. I must say in all honesty that I found your answer somewhat less than helpful, because I am still confused. This may be a reflection on me rather than on you, and I am sure that it is, but I have been unable to elicit what I wanted, so I should like to get my question on the record to make it clear that I do not understand what you said. If I may have your forbearance, Mr. Gourlay, I shall do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to find out whether the discussion of the schedule will be preceded by one clause stand part debate for the whole of clause 1 or by a series of such debates in relation to the proposed new sections 28A, 28B, 28C, and so on, in the manner in which the clause is broken down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if my ruling was not clear. I thought that it was clear to every hon. Member on the Committee. The Bill has a clause 1, and there could be, or there may not be, a clause 1 stand part debate. That is entirely at the discretion of the Chair, and depends on the conduct of the members of the Committee, on the way in which the debate is conducted. Therefore, I cannot rule at this stage whether there will be a clause stand part debate on clause 1, but there certainly will not be more than one. The rules of the House do not allow more than one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Gourlay, for your guidance. You have made the point abundantly clear. I appreciate your ruling. I am not happy
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
with it, but that is not your consideration. It is something with which my conscience has to wrestle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem for some of us if clause 1 is to be followed by schedule 1 is that we feel that schedule 1 will not assist us in our wider consideration of the clause. We feel that it would be more helpful if the Government were to provide us, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire suggested, with some legal advice on the whole question of the status of the appeals committee and the problems which could arise with the sheriff. We would like to be assured by the Government that if we are to take it in this order the relationship between the two, which we consider to be somewhat confused, will be clarified by a legal spokesman. We have every confidence that the limited abilities of the Ministers will be brought to bear on the Committee, but we recognise that what skills and talents they have are not necessarily of a legal nature. Because of the legal complexities of clause 1 and schedule 1, we should like an assurance that the good offices of the Solicitor-General will be made available to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel that it is an unhappy arrangement to take clause 1 and schedule 1 together. We hope that we shall not have to vote. We hope for an assurance from the Minister this morning that consideration will be given to the legal complexities and that we shall be able to avail ourselves of the legal knowledge and experience which the Solicitor-General can bring to bear. If we cannot have that assurance, we may well have to vote against the motion and ask the Government to think again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are certainly not happy with the relationship between clause 1 and schedule 1. It is important that we get this right, because it is quite likely that we shall not have another opportunity in the lifetime of this Government, however long they last, to debate the educational future of our country. Therefore, it is important that we try to make the best of what is a pretty bad Bill. That is commonly agreed by every Opposition hon. Member, and I know that very few hon. Members have given it an unqualified welcome even on the Government side of the Committee. So it is important that we try to make the best of a bad job, this dog's breakfast. We need to start off on the right footing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to end on a conciliatory note, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire said. I would like to think that we could get clause 1 and schedule 1 together in harmony, that there be a degree of legal support for schedule 1 which would avoid what we think might well be difficulties if the two were pushed through in an unhappy shotgun marriage by the Minister and the Government. We hope that in our consideration of these two parts of the Bill we shall be able to have expert legal knowledge and the opportunity to see a substantially revised schedule 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that I may well be out of order, and prepared myself to sit down. We are concerned about the rush which has characterised the Government's handling of the legislation so far. They are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0031">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
desperate to get it through, without any regard to the implications of serious consideration of the legislation. An opportunity to stop and reconsider the question would be afforded if the Government were to seek to withdraw their motion and let us look again at the relationship between clause 1 and schedule 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek your guidance, Mr. Gourlay. I listened very carefully to your ruling on the nature of clause 1, which I accept absolutely. But it is a very long clause; it covers some 10 pages. If I remember rightly, on Second Reading the Secretary of State himself noted the unusual nature of this clause and the way in which it is arranged. Normally it would have been part I of the Bill and there would have been a Series of clauses in that part. As it has turned out, We have it all in one major clause, with probably five or six different principles involved. That leaves those of us on the Opposition Benches in considerable difficulty, particularly those on the Back Bench. We are pushed into the position of voting yea or nay for the whole clause, even if we accept some of the principles within it but not others. Normally we would not be in that position on a clause of this nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What you have ruled is absolutely correct within the Standing Orders, Mr. Gourlay, but is it in order for a Government to impose upon the Opposition and their own Back-Bench Members this style of clause, which limits the genuine examination of and debate on the principles involved in the Bill? That is exactly what is happening. We cannot discuss the individual principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may not reach the end of clause 1 for some considerable time on, because many amendments to it will bs tabled. You will probably then rule, Mr. Gourlay, that a stand part debate is net necessary, because the clause will have been examined in some detail throughout. In normal circumstances you would probably be quite right to do so, but in these circumstances the Opposition and indeed all Back-Bench Members would not be given the opportunity to discuss the clause in the entirety of its principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is there any way in which, Mr. Gourlay, using your powers as Chairman, through the authority of the House, you can insist that the Government restructure this part of the Bill? It would mean changing the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

When it comes to how we discuss clause 1, due regard will be taken by the Chair of the nature of the debate before we come to the Question, That clause 1 stand part of the Bill.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will be delighted to know, Mr. Gourlay, that I agree that clause 1, being the first clause of the Bill, should be debated first, and therefore I shall not seek to argue against that. But you will not be surprised to know that I am not in favour of schedule 1 being debated next. In explaining my reasons for that I hope to stay well within the bounds of order, and to persuade some Conservative hon. Members that my arguments in favour of schedule 1 being discussed after clauses 2 to 4 are acceptable. Perhaps I can even persuade the Minister, because I am really seeking to be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is in some difficulty, because it is very unusual for a Bill to be drafted as this Bill has been. For example, the proposed new section 28A in clause 1 does not refer to this Bill at all, but refers to the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. When the Bill was published it was appreciated right away that the manner in which it had been drafted was bound to present some difficulties for the Committee considering it. The special needs clause, clause 4, of the Bill, has also been drafted in that way. It refers to sections 60 to 65 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 1 lays out the detail for the appeal committee which will deal with the appeals arising not only from clause 1 but from clause 4. Clause 1 deals merely with the right of a parent to appeal against an education committee's decision not to admit a child to a particular school. Clause 4 has nothing to do with that right. That clause—the special needs clause—deals with the right of the parents to appeal to the same appeal committee as would consider the parents' right to have their child placed in another school and that same committee will consider appeals from parents who are dissatisfied as to whether their child should or should not be a recorded child. The question of a recorded child, as defined in clause 4, is totally different from the kind of appeal that the appeal committee will be considering in relation to appeals that flow from the provisions of clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I have said so far establishes that the committee to be set up under schedule 1 will deal not only with appeals flowing from clause 3 but with appeals which flow from clause 4. Those appeals are totally different in character and purpose from the appeals under clause 1, and derive from a totally different set of circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dangers must be obvious even to the Minister. Because of the numbers game and the fodder on the Government Back Benches wanting never to be confused by facts, but merely to vote, we accept that we shall have to establish our arguments and win them, but very often lose the vote. The Committee will impose the will of the majority on the minority and agree that the appeals procedure be set up. We shall then consider schedule 1, which deals with the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0032">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
details of the appeal committee, and then we shall start debating clauses 2 to 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4 deals with certain special educational needs, which many hon. Members consider to be one of the most important aspects of the Bill. Even before we start to debate clause 4, the appeals machinery will already have been established by the Committee, but the Committee will not have considered the implications of the appeals that will arise from clause 4. As I have said, (hey are totally different. They are appeals about whether a child should be a recorded child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 1 is specific. It defines the kinds of people who would be members of an appeal committee. It does not cater for the children with special educational needs, against the background of the recorded child argument. There is no provision in schedule 1 to allow someone with that kind of specialist interest to be a member of the appeal committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have got the order of consideration wrong. It would be simple to accommodate my argument. Hon. Gentlemen must see the sense in this. We should be allowed to debate clause 1, go on to debate clauses 2, 3 and 4, with particular emphasis on clause 4, and then take schedule 1, which relates not only to clause 1 but to clause 4. I hope that the Minister will accept my view, because it would not inconvenience the Committee and would make for a more coherent and more orderly debate. It would certainly make for better understanding by all members of the Committee. Ihe debate on clause 4 will be interesting and detailed. Most members of the Committee—certainly most of my hon. Friends, and particularly the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson)—will be able to bring their specialist knowledge of special educational needs children to that debate. Once it has taken place it will be sensible to go on to debate schedule 1. At that stage we can examine whether the Government have got the content of that schedule right or wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be the first to argue that if all that the Government want to do is to put through clause 1 and deal with the appeals arising under that clause, schedule 1 may Well fit in. It may or may not. I would not be prepared to go to the stake on that kind of argument, but I certainly would be prepared to go to the stake on the argument that schedule 1 does not fit the appeals that would come under clause 4, which are totality different, and are in every way much more important appeals than those which would arise under clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The appeals under clause 4 are appeals about the profound question whether a child should be a recorded child. There will be some terrible arguments between parents and the authority about whether a child should be a recorded child. The appeal procedure set out in schedule 1 does not take account of the kind of views that will be expressed by parents, who will obviously be quite emotional, because they are being told that their child has special educational needs. They are being told about
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
all the difficulties that their child has, and any member of the Committee who is a parent must know the traumatic effect that that will have on parents. It takes parents some time to come to terms with that kind of information. My own view is that schedule 1 certainly does not take account of the kind of appeal that would flow from clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister can facilitate the work of die Committee if he accepts that the two kinds of appeal that the Committee is dealing with will be entirely different in content, in nature, in background, in emotion and in every aspect. I am sure that hon. Members on the Government side who may have listened to me will also take the view that it would be more sensible and more orderly to take schedule 1 after clause 4. That would be a very simple change for the Minister to make. It would allow us to have the important debate on clause 4, and we could then consider schedule 1 and decide whether the provisions in the schedule really fit the needs established by clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not dealt with the further appeal. Here again there is a major difference, in that the appeals arising under clause 1 can go one stage further than the appeals arising under clause 4. The appeals arising under clause 1 can eventually find their way to the sheriff. The appeals arising under clause 4 cannot, according to the provisions of that clause, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The parent of a recorded child may refer to an appeal committee set up under section 28D of this Act"</p></blockquote>
Clause 4 does not say that the parent has the right of appeal to the sheriff. That is a totally different approach from that taken in clause 1. Appeals under clause 4, which are to be dealt with by the same committee—I am sorry to keep coming back to this point, but it is very important—must stop at the committee. There is no provision in clause 4 for the appeals to go further. Yet the final decisions on appeals arising under clause 4—the recorded child appeal, which is much more important than the appeals arising under clause 1—lie with the committee established under schedule 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main concern is that if the Government are to go ahead with this kind of legislation, we have a duty as a Committee to protect the parents, particularly the parents of the children with special needs who will be affected by this legislation, especially when it comes to an appeal. We have a duty to make sure that their interests are properly represented in the machinery that is set up to consider the appeals on the basis of the recorded child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have persuaded the Minister to take this simple step. It will not inconvenience die Committee; it will help us. I think that the Minister will agree that I have made a fairly persuasive case. I have not sought to delay the Committee. I have sought to make serious points, because clause 4 is a serious matter. I hope that I have persuaded the Minister that it would be sensible for schedule 1 to be considered after clauses 2 to 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

points that may help the Committee. The first is on the question of the length of clause 1—the fact that it runs to 10 pages. My right hon. Friend said on Second Reading that the drafting of the Bill was rather unusual. For reasons well known to the Committee, this is a product of the Renton committee. It will facilitate the legislation in Scotland after the passing of the Bill, and the consolidation of this into the 1980 Act will be much easier. That is why we should put up with what I agree is a measure of inconvenience at this stage in referring to the Act and the Bill throughout our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not unusual to have a clause of this length. In the Education (Scotland) Act 1969, clause 4 ran to just over 14 pages and inserted no fewer than 10 sections into what was then the consolidation Act, the Education (Scotland) Act 1962. So there is a precedent for a clause of this length.

On the question of schedule 1 and when it should be discussed, I am grateful to the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) for the points that he made. I am happy to accept his suggestion that we should alter the motion and take schedule 1 after clause 4.

There may be benefits to the Government in adopting the suggestion.

council in the business of the request of parents to have their children transferred to another school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some parts of Scotland the role of the school council has been central to the success of the exercise of parental choice in respect of the schools to which children should go. Certainly, when one considers that the local authority which is responsible for something like half of Scotland, namely, Strathclyde, has given to school councils a very big responsibility in the handling of parental requests, at this stage we should take account of the fact and recognise that it would be in the interests of the education system and of the school council movement, for want of a better expression, if school councils were given some recognition of the role which has been played in the major authority in Scotland in the sense that it covers half the people who live in Scotland and has very many under its responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I choose the expression " school councils " because we feel that, as far as Strathclyde is concerned, which operates on the basis of area schools councils, it would be preferable to see as the point of contact between parents and authorities the school council, particularly as some of the regional authorities are remote. In some instances, the devolved structure of administration of local government in respect of education and the divisions which are in operation are not altogether successful. It is fair to say that the experiences of those who have dealt with divisional offices and then gone on to the central department of the education authority can be somewhat less than helpful. Certainly it has been suggested by some individuals, in the case of some local authorities when parents have tried to request that their child be sent to a school other than the local one, that this devolved structure of administration has been cumbersome and obstructive. We have seen instances where the first letter has gone to the head office, as it were, and has been lost there or has been dealt with in a less than satisfactory manner. Subsequently the person has had to write to the divisional officer; there have been phone calls and difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The request in the first instance should be made to the school council. We recognise that the school council administratively at this time does not necessarily have a big back-up in terms of staff. We do not wish to see mini-education authorities on an area basis being built up, but, given the relatively small number of cases which school councils deal with in this area, it would be an appropriate method of dealing with the question for the school council to be the first port of call of any parents who- wish to have a child moved to another school or to go to a school other than the one which is in the catchment area where they stay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the school councils have been a qualified success. In some areas they have not been as effective as they might have been. I speak from two years' experience of membership of a school council. The hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) may echo this. I am not sure if he was on a school council when he worked as a teacher, and I am not even sure if the hon. Member for Perth and East
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
Perthshire (Mr. Walker), as a parent, was on a school council. My experience is somewhat limited. I was there in the early days when school councils were finding their feet, and some of them had difficulty in knowing exactly what was required of them. Some local authorities, because of the structure of the school councils, have been more successful in structuring the work of the councils and giving them responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall be considering later on the detailed responsibilities of school councils in respect of appeals, but we know that under the 1973 Act there is a statutory responsibility on a sub-committee of a school council in respect of attendance, and that this has been fairly successfully carried through in respect of truancy. The school council has been able to be a sensitive, effective body dealing in a relaxed manner with problems which, if they come to the the courts, are sometimes dealt with in a way which frightens the parents and the children and is not particularly helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The school council could be, in some respects, analogous to the children's panel in the sense of being a relatively informal, non-bureaucratic body which can deal with what are often complex and sensitive problems. A variety of reasons is advanced for children to be given what we shall have to consider to be special treatment. We should like to think that at the very outset the school council would be given a responsibility and that that responsibility would be in the first instance to receive requests for transfer and, in the second instance, to deal with appeals. We shall come to that later, but it is essential to recognise from the outset that we are seeking to afford the school councils a responsibility which in some areas of Scotland they have not yet received. In those areas of Scotland where they do have this power, it has been a largely successful way of operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think that the school council movement should be given a vote of confidence and that the councils should have this initial responsibility in respect of written requests from parents. But we recognise that there are two schools of thought about the Strathclyde model. I have before me a report commissioned by the Scottish Education Department entitled " Scottish School Councils: Policy-Making, Participation or Irrelevance? " It was written by three members of the university of Glasgow—Alastair Macbeth, Malcolm MacKenzie and Ian Breckenridge. I do not agree with all of it, but it is a useful document which lays out in tabular form and in a comprehensive manner their findings on school councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They are less than enthusiastic—I must be honest—about the area committees in the sense that they come down in favour of each school having its own council. They say that the advantages of area committees are that they can act as pressure groups to influence education authorities and to enable a comparison of ideas. Then the report says that they can deal with inter-school problems, such as zoning and inter-school relations, and it says that large area councils with real powers and challenging tasks may
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0035">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
also attract a higher quality of member than would a smaller, lower-level council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is always a problem in that the lower-level councils may just be something like PTAs, but I think it is quite clear that the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council does not see the school council as being a PTA. I think it would be rather an invidious role for the school councils to act as a glorified PTA, and it would be very difficult for them to do so if they were operating on a single-school basis. We envisage the school council as being an area council which will have responsibility for a reasonable number of schools within an area, and that this responsibility will enable the school council to have an overview of the needs of an area, and to deal with matters in a less bureaucratic way than the local authorities might do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not seeking to create little committees which will tyrannise over parents or restrict their rights. We would like to see the establishment of school councils at the very heart of the question of the exercise of parental choice. The experience of the children's panels and the attendance sub-committees of existing school councils suggests that there is a strong case for the relaxed, informal treatment of parental requests, in the same way as the children's panels deal with them, and in the same way as the attendance sub-committees have been able to deal with the very complex questions of truancy. We should try from the very outset to provide parents with a relaxed, informal approach rather than the often insensitive and bureaucratic approach which comes from large organisations dealing with the problems of the individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have put down four amendments. Amendment No. 1 seeks to have "education authority" deleted and " school council" included. The second one, amendment No. 2—in the event of the first one being defeated—seeks to have " school council " added as an alternative to the education authority. I would imagine that if letters were sent to the education authority they would be passed on to the appropriate member of the school council, who would then consider them. We would also hope that amendment No. 3 would be accepted, adding " school council " after the word " authority " in line 13. If we cannot have " authority " deleted and " school council" inserted instead, then we should like the words " school council" added. The effect would be that in the event of a parent making a written request, it would be sent immediately to the school council and be dealt with as expeditiously as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We remain to be convinced of the need for an extension of parental choice. As we said on Second Reading, we are fairly confident that the existing procedures, if they were applied throughout Scotland, would have the effect of providing parents with a reasonable degree of freedom in terms of the choice of their child's education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, we nevertheless feel that, if we are to have a parent's charter, it should have at its heart not the responsibilities of the bureaucrats

being underpinned, but rather the responsibilities of parents in general, with the opportunity to participate in the determination of the kind of school system in which their children will be involved. So if we have school councils operating in this area from the very outset, those people who are members of school councils and who, in some instances, in some parts of Scotland, have been casting around looking for things to do, will have tasks in hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These tasks will be of a worthwhile nature. They will therefore attract perhaps more people to the school council, because one of the difficulties hitherto has been that there has not been a great deal of competition for membership. There have been problems in some cases where parents have gone on in the misguided view that they would somehow be involved in matters of curriculm development, or dealing with overall educational matters, in which—quite correctly, I think—the schools have only a very limited role. In any profession it should be the responsibility of the professionals to a very large extent to determine the priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we hope that the limited role which schools councils have under the present legislation could be extended to cover this area. If we could give them a meaningful role which could be recognised from the outset, it would be very helpful to the school councils. It would enable them to attract more people because there would be work for them to do. That work would be capable of providing the community at large with a sense of confidence in our education system. It could start simply by the school councils being the first stage in the request procedure. That is what the amendments seek to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that the Minister will take on board that we do not seek to scupper the legislation at the outset. We consider these to be sensible, constructive amendments. We do not see them in any negative light, and I hope that I have not conveyed the impression that I am trying to ruin the parent's charter, because we do not reject the concept of a parent's charter. We have some qualifications about the manner in which the Government are going about it, and we think that if we are to have a parent's charter it is better that it should be a parent's charter which applies not only to parents of those children seeking transfers but to as many parents as possible who are involved in the education service as, one might say, consumers or clients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might result in more parents seeking to exercise that right if they felt that the body to which they would be referring their request was compassionate and one which did not have the rather forbidding aspect of a large bureaucratic organisation. I use the term " bureaucratic" in a non-perjorative sense because I recognise that the local authorities have a difficult job to do and that they do it in most instances with a great deal of sensitivity and care. The problem arises due to the sheer scale of the operation in many instances. The local authorities do not inspire confidence in many parents. If the school councils were given the responsibility of dealing with these requests from the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0036">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
outset, I think it would inspire confidence in those parents who wished to make die request, having misgivings about die education which their children were receiving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it was dealt with in a straightforward and simple manner by the local authorities, we would then be able to say to the parents that they were having a fair crack of die whip, that the case was not being dealt with by some clerk in an office but by people like themselves—other parents and other people interested in education. There would then be a fair measure of reduction in the mistrust and misgivings which many parents have at present and which certainly the school councils were intended to allay and reduce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are very pleased to put forward these amendments. If the Minister is not prepared to concede on the point of withdrawing any reference to " education authority" and simply making it " school council", we are prepared, as second best, to have " school council " added to " education authority " as another body to which written request would be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not take up any more of the Committee's time. Suffice it to say that we want to see parental requests dealt with in the most fair and -sensitive manner. We think that it is a responsibility of the school councils to carry this through, rather than the already overburdened local authorities, some of which have not been as helpful as they might have been in the past, for whatever reasons. The main reason, I suggest, is the scale of the authorities. I would not say that any authority inspired a great deal of confidence in the way in which these requests are treated. I do not single out any authority for special blame.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system in Strathclyde, which is the biggest authority in Scotland, has been relatively successful. The Strathclyde authority has considered it over the three or four years for which it has been operating and has come to the conclusion that it is the most helpful way of assisting parents. In the light of Strathclyde's experience, which is probably the most comprehensive in Scotland, we would have no hesitation in recommending school councils as the first body to become involved in the placing of children in schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendments for two specific reasons. First, involving the school councils at least starts to bring about what should be the genuine concern of those concerned with education in relation to parents, children and schools—parental involvement with their children's education rather than parental choice as being the only way in which that can be expressed. What seems to me often to be wrong with the education system is that it is divorced from the school, and the parents are often kept apart. They are not allowed to meet too often. I used quite often to' go into schools where one saw signs saying " No parent may see a teacher unless he has seen the headmaster first." There has often been a deliberate attempt in schools to prevent parents from being as involved as they
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
should be in their children's education. School councils can provide one of the ways in which many of us hope that in the future parents will be more involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present structure is not always the best, and perhaps we ought to look at that at a later stage. But at least it gives an opportunity for some parents to be involved in the ways in which the school is run. Giving the power to the school councils, as opposed to the education authorities, starts involving parents more in the whole process of the education of their children. That is really the way in which we should be looking at parental choice—trying to get parents involved, so that they make sure that the schools their kids go to are doing the sort of job that they want them to do. That is better than giving them a choice, which is perhaps quite genuine, but which gives them the ability to switch to a school which perhaps is nearer to them. They should be involved in the school, making sure that it is working properly and operating to the benefit of their children and the community as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is one that my hon. Friend made. " Education authority ", is a very vague and generalised concept. In theory it means the elected members plus those who have come in from other bodies to the education committee, because that is the legal education authority. We know that in this procedure it will not be the elected education committee that will deal with the problems of parental choice and read the written requests. Having spoken to members of education authorities, I know that one thing the elected members are never allowed to talk about in the Strathclyde region is what happens to education in the schools. They can talk about administration—who is to be the headmaster here and who is to do this—but the day-to-day running and what is taught in schools is not dealt with by people who have been elected; it is left to the professionals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about the professional administrators in the education authority who will be dealing with problems. Does this mean that every written request will have to be addressed to the director of education for the particular authority, or will there be some process laid down in the Bill—it certainly is not yet—making clear the specific area in which the education authority is operating?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Strathclyde region the director of education covers an enormous area. I cannot remember how many sub-offices he has. If the request is addressed to the director of education, his staff's first task will be to send the letter to the area sub-office. There is already a little time lag in the process. Then it goes on to the area head. I think that he is called the divisional officer. He will start to process it downwards. He will have officers who will deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the present structure of education authorities does not allow for the control of quite small areas within the sub-areas. If one takes Lanarkshire as being a sub-area—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to do so, Mr. Fraser. I should have done so considerably earlier had not my hon. Friends been forcing me to give way so that they could make their own points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
I am not sure what I was saying. If I remember rightly, I had got to the point of the sub-area in the education authority. Although there is a divisional officer in the Strathclyde region for Glasgow, one for Lanarkshire, and one for Dunbartonshire, among others, they are responsible for the whole of Glasgow, the whole of Lanarkshire, and the whole of Dunbartonshire. The distribution of their teams downwards is not on a geographical basis. It is not a question of someone being appointed for Hamilton to look after Hamilton, someone to look after Lanark, someone to look after Forth and that area, and someone to look after Cathcart or Kilmarnock. There is a division of responsibilities within those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the parental choice letter put in by the parent, the written request, would go to an officer who had responsibility for the whole of Glasgow, Ayrshire or Lanarkshire in respect of this aspect of the education authority's work. That means that there is no way in which he could have a good, sound knowledge of the local schools involved. He would therefore be forced into the situation of playing, as the Under-Secretary of State does, purely the numbers game. His involvement would tend to be on the basis of looking at the situation and the number of children in one school as opposed to another. That would be the sort of criterion upon which he would begin to make choices. He would not be in a position to judge properly the roles of specific schools and the work that was done in them. If he did, it would involve a long investigation into each case and it would take a long time to build up expertise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am somewhat concerned about the information that my hon. Friend is imparting to the Committee. It is certainly news to me. I understand precisely what he is saying, I have fears in the opposite direction—for the parents. How are the parents to know to whom to appeal by letter in such a complicated system? With this apparatus, how would, for instance, a person living on a vast housing estate know of his right of appeal? How is it imagined that such people will be notified of their rights?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As with Government Departments, if one knows, that is fine; one can make a request. But if one does not know, one will not be bothering the authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>[Mr. HARRY GOURLAY 
	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good point. It highlights the whole point which the Opposition are trying to put, that this process must be brought as close as possible to the parents in terms of their making that choice, in terms of the world they know and the world and the society in which they are operating, rather than the broader bureaucracy—and I do not condemn the bureaucracy of local authorities in any way—of the local authority, which is remote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Few parents in the large schemes in my hon. Friend's constituency and equally in mine really understand how the local authority operates. Their point of contact with education is the school. It is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0038">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
not bureaucrats sitting in some office in Glasgow, but the school itself, the staff and the headmaster, and even the headmaster can be a fairly remote figure to many people. There is a need to bring the whole thing closer to the parents, to the schools themselves. If we can do that we can bring the process to the school councils and let them take the initial letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some cases there will be a need to go on to appeal after the school council has taken its decision. That appeal may be higher up, but the fact is that, particularly to the parents whom the Government sometimes say this is about, the parents on lower incomes who they say should have the choice, it should be a matter of school councils, where they can relate directly. It may even be people who they know who will be on the school council, and who will take the decision. In some cases teachers from the schools will be involved on the school council as well. It will not be a remote bureaucracy which they feel remote from; if one talks about " us " and " them " the bureaucracy is definitely " them". They are people whom the parents never see and are not involved with; they have no concept of how to get through to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, there is point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock about getting information to the parents about this right. The middle-class parent—perhaps all of us here—would know exactly how to deal with that problem. We know the system. Middle-class parents know the system. They know how to get through to the bureaucracy if they have to. If they do not know, they will quickly find out. But the working-class parent does not know that sort of procedure. He does not know how to get through to the bureaucrats higher up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At our surgeries we often hear complaints from constituents, who, in dealing with a variety of Government and local government organisations, are able to talk only to a girl on the desk in an office, and they never seem to be able to get beyond that. Each time they go it is a different girl. They are never able to talk to anyone in a position of responsibility. That will be true in this case too. Getting through to the appropriate person will be very difficult for parents who are not acquainted with the way in which this operates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be easier for a school council to get information through to the parents in its area, through the primary and secondary schools which it covers. It would be easier for the school council to get through to the parents the rights which they have under the Bill. The parents would then be putting their letters to the school council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I finish by making a similar point to that made by my hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill). I have some reservations about the present structure of schools councils. We should start with the process of giving the schools councils the powers. If the Government accept the amendments we shall at a later stage, either by way of amendments or new clauses from the Opposition or from the Government, look at the structure of schools councils and methods by which they should operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
My complaint about school councils is not about the councils themselves but about the fact that local authorities have not yet given them the power and the right to make necessary changes in the schools over which they have some authority. Let us agree to the amendment and then look very carefully at the question of school councils. There has to be more parental involvement in them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local primary school which my children attend has one representative on the school council to represent a school of 600 to 700 children. That is not sufficient representation of the parents involved in that school, particularly as it is a school in which the headmaster flatly refuses to consider a PTA. When we come to new clauses I may look at that—the fact that headmasters can essentially block parents rights in terms of parent-teacher associations. I should like to see more parents involved on school councils. I should like to see them given greater power to change the structure—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have been listening with some interest to the hon. Gentleman's remarks. We are discussing not the composition of school councils but merely whether we should insert the words " schools council" into the clause instead of " education authority".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxtom</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much take that point, Mr. Gourlay. I think that the bulk of my remarks has been on that. I was concluding by saying that, if we are to give these powers to school councils—and I think that we should—we must look at the structure of the school council as well, but that obviously is a point to make later. 
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These amendments well merit the support of Conservative Back Benchers, if not that of the Ministers. In no way do they detract from the parental choice which is being given. Arguably, they bring parental choice genuinely closer to the people. They extend it to a much wider section of the community, because parents will know what their rights are. That starts a process of genuine parental involvement in the whole process of education, which has been sadly lacking for much too long. For those reasons I support the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I intervene briefly to use these amendments as probing amendments to ask my hon. Friend the Minister to answer two or three questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, what happens in those authorities such as Strathclyde where the school councils are already used as a vehicle for appeal and decisions on school choice? They have been used reasonably successfully. Is there anything in the Bill which will prevent Strathclyde from continuing and improving on that system? In other words, can it carry on with the system that it has now, perhaps having to superimpose the system in the Bill in the event of appeals from the school councils? Certainly, in the initial stages, can it deal with the appeals via the school councils, as it does now?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This may be a suitable stage, in consideration of a Bill of this length, for my hon. Friend to make a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
few comments on the general position of school councils and how the Government see them, particularly in the background of the report by Macbeth, MacKenzie and Breckenridge of Glasgow University. I consider that we should develop school councils. They provide a way in which the parents may have a more direct involvement in the schools. They can facilitate the parental choice which the Government are so keen to implement and which I am sure my hon. Friend is delighted to hear the Opposition wish to implement as well. That bodes well for us in proceeding through this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my hon. Friend deal with those two points? First, what is the role of those authorities that already use school councils as the vehicle of parental choice? Secondly, how do the Government see school councils developing in the future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) for the points that he made in his brief but important contribution. Before answering him I should like to tell the hon. Members for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) and for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) that I am happy to note that there is a great deal of agreement in the Committee this morning. No one seems to be objecting to the opportunity for parents to express their views and to know their rights as regards choice of schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire said that there was a need to clarify the situation. Those are my own words, but I think that that was the sense of what he said. He suggested that the question of parents making an appeal of whatever kind to local authorities regarding choice of school was unsatisfactory at the moment. That is a fundamental aspect of the Bill. There is a need to include in it the rights and duties of parents and local authorities, so that the existing unsatisfactory law may make way for legislation which will make clear to education authorities and parents exactly where they stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart gave his support to the principle of parental involvement in education. I submit that the key to parental involvement must start with parents having a choice of school that they wish their children to attend. If they are denied choice in the first instance, and if the school time of their children is unhappy and the parents are dissatisfied with the school, the degree of parental involvement in their children's education is likely suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is evidence of this in various parts of the country, to be seen when one looks at the degree of involvement of parents in education. So I am happy to welcome the agreement in principle on the need to clarify the law on the question of parental choice. The shorthand expression " parents' charter" has been used, but we are trying to clarify the law for parents and local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this House we represent first the parents and then, perhaps secondly, the local authorities. That is why I am so pleased to see that changes have
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
taken place in the speeches of Labour hon. Members this morning. So often on the Floor of the House and in other Committees one begins to believe that Labour Members are sent to represent the local authorities and statutory bodies, and worry about representing their constituents only when it comes to election time. I must admit that to judge by their numbers they must be pretty good at doing that at election time, but they conveniently forget about it during the course of a Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavam</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister realise that a school council is also a statutory body, and that we are sticking up for its right with these amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I am saying. The Labour Party has tended usually to favour the rights of statutory bodies. The school councils are as the hon. Gentleman says, a statutory body, set up by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, and they have a role to- play in this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To stay with matters on which the Committee is in agreement, I say to the hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire that I fully accept the spirit in which he has moved this amendment. I fully accept that he wishes to make sure first that the legislation does nothing to impede school councils from being involved in the question of parents' choice. Secondly, he wants to encourage them to play a large role in parental choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the first point, which was also raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll, I can confirm that there is nothing in the legislation which in any way impedes or upsets the arrangements which, for example, Strathclyde regional council has been using for some time, whereby the school councils are very much involved in parents' wishes on choice of school. We are happy to encourage the local authorities, and the legislation leaves it open to a local authority at the sifting stage, at the first stage in the process of parents expressing their choice of school, to decide how it wishes that to be carried out. As we have agreed, many of them use school councils at present, but there are other authorities which, for good reason, may decide to continue some other operation at the first sifting stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we do not wish to do is to lay down in the legislation precise and bureaucratic procedure as to how a local authority will deal with the first stage, when the parent first makes a request about a child's education. The method of handling that is left entirely to the local authority, and that is how the Bill is framed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my explanation has made clear to the hon. Gentleman that the amendment is not necessary. Not only is it unnecessary because of the spirit of the legislation, but it would be damaging to the Bill were we to accept it; it would damage it in principle and not merely damage it in the drafting sense. One of the fundamental principles of Education (Scotland) Acts is to lay down that it is for an education authority to secure adequate and efficient education for its area. It
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0040">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
would be entirely inconsistent with that principle to introduce new provisions seeking to impose on delegate bodies the authority's specific duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the intention of the amendment, that school councils should play a prominent part in dealing with placing requests, but there is nothing in the Bill to prevent an education authority from delegating this responsibility to school councils. The amendment would be a considerable restriction on the freedom of discretion which authorities at present enjoy, which I am sure the hon. Gentleman would not wish to introduce. In addition there may be applications, particularly in the case of handicapped children whose parents seek admission for their child to a normal school, where the case might be more appropriately delegated to the head-teacher or the director of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important objective is that authorities should be able to adjust procedures for handling applications to meet local needs. It would be wrong specifically to require applications to be handled in one way, regardless of local circumstances. I trust, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman will see that it is far better for the local authorities to decide how placing requests should best be dealt with in their area, and that it would be wrong to lay down provisions in these matters which are best decided locally. I hope that the fact that there is complete agreement in spirit on both sides of the Committee, and the fact that the amendment would impede the legislation in this respect, will persuade the hon. Gentleman to ask to withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
School councils have rightly been mentioned by several hon. Gentlemen, including my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll. There is no reference in the Bill to school councils, as hon. Members will be aware. Some have inquired recently about the consultative paper on the subject which I indicated a year ago I had it in mind to produce. Events have moved on since then, however, since the Glasgow university report was prepared and published. A lot of water has flowed under the bridge, and before we decide exactly how to deal further with the question of school councils and their constitution, and the way in which they should operate, we should allow the procedures that we are laying down in this legislation to gain some experience and to run for some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Glasgow survey, which was carried out a couple of years ago, was based on the previous legislation and the difficulties of school councils in establishing themselves, especially in some areas. We are now clarifying the law in a very important way regarding the role of school councils in this and in other respects. Because of that, and because of the considerable upheaval that these arrangements will mean for at least some local authorities in providing information to parents in a way that has not been done previously, or for some time, we feel that we should allow a year or so to pass before producing the consultative paper. We want the consultative paper to contain some of the experience of the legislation that we are processing in the Committee. We, think that by our allowing some time for that to
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
happen the consultative document and the discussion which follows will be more meaningful.

On making these points I am in no way critical of the work done by the team at Glasgow university. It produced an extremely helpful study. It is just an accident of liming that we have been proceeding with our own consultations on the larger question of parental choice, and framing legislation for this purpose. Therefore, we think that it would be wrong for consultation to start now on the proposals made by the university.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee might be interested in some indication of the time scale involved. Even if we manage to get this legislation through the Committee stage without too much delay, it will be 1982 before this can come into operation. If the Minister then wants to see it operating for two or three years, or some such period, before he looks at the question of the school councils, are we not talking about 1985 or 1986 before something is done?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point. I do not like to think, any more than he does, that we shall be waiting until 1985 or 1986, but I accept the tendency to see things in that sort of time scale. However, I do not believe that now is the time to put out the consultative paper, though I am not sure when the most appropriate time will be. Clearly, it will be after the Bill has completed all its stages. After that we shall have to consider how we should start consultation. Perhaps it could be done in tandem with the local authorities, when they set up the procedures required by the Bill. I would not rule out the possibility that the consultative paper might be put out next year, even though, as the hon. Gentleman rightly says, it will be mainly for the summer intake of 1982 that the provisions of the parents' charter, as it is called, will be ready to take effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disturbed by the Minister's logic in saying that we ought to put through a Bill and then have consultation about its effects. It appears to me that we ought to have the fullest consultation possible before we attempt to process this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman has misunderstood. He raises two points. The first relates to consultation taking place prior to the Bill's coming before the Committee. The consultative document on parental choice was published in February 1980 and has been available for over a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultation to which I have been referring is the consultation document on school councils following the excellent report of the Glasgow university study team. Consultation has been deferred simply because we are looking at the whole area. I hate using the word " interface ", but we are looking at the interface between parents and schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of consultation on the report produced by Glasgow university is one which we should bear in mind throughout the passing of this legislation and its implementation. I am as impatient
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart about looking at school councils. I am trying to see whether there is any prospect of, for example, having a school council for each school. I am one of those who, some years ago, were excited by the Taylor report—not the Teddy Taylor report—when it was published in England and Wales, which referred to the setting up of boards of governors for each individual school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people in Scotland, not least local authorities, throw up their hands in horror at the prospect of such a suggestion, because they feel that at present there is not the interest in schools among parents and others to produce sufficient people to provide a school councils or board of governors for each individual school. The steps that we are taking in the Bill, first to involve school councils more, and, secondly, to involve parents more in the children's education, might be the groundwork that is essential to provide much more interest in education among parents, so that we shall be able to find volunteers, should we decide that we wish to have a school council for every school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister substantiate the remark that he has just made? Is there any evidence to suggest that it has been easier to get members for school councils in Strathclyde, where they have operated on an area basis, than it has been in say, Lothian or some of the other regions, where they have been organised on the basis of a secondary school, with feeder primary schools as joint members? Is there any evidence to suggest that one local authority has been more successful than another in getting the number of parents that it requires to fill that part of the school council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The evidence is simply the number of schools and the size to which the area has to be stretched to provide a school council. Clearly, if there is an abundance of volunteers coming forward and people are available to form school councils, one can do so. In smaller areas a situation can even be arrived at in which there will be one council for each school. I would think that one of the reasons why local authorities have required the areas for school councils to be large is simply the fear that they will be unable to find sufficient people to man the school councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Glasgow university report refers to the comparative success which Lothian has enjoyed in giving school councils the responsibility for setting up parent-teacher associations. It has been a feature of the Lothian development of the school council movement that alongside it has been the PTA. I endeavoured this morning to distinguish, in functions and responsibilities, between the two types of organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, some local authorities, having had imposed upon them the statutory obligation to set up school councils, have taken the view that, if there is to be a narrow base from which members will be taken, in order to encourage interest one of the first tasks of school councils should be to encourage parental involvement. Under the Strathclyde experiment it has been a major responsibility of local
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
authorities, as we are advocating in this Bill for all of Scotland, to encourage parental interest and involvement. There is the other tack of encouraging PTA-inspired interest or getting PTAs going and then getting the parental interest. Has the Minister any evidence which is more up to date than this report to substantiate my points?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister replies, may I say that he is beginning to go rather wide of the amendment as well. I hope that he will reply to the hon. Gentleman as briefly as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. A number of Opposition Members, not least my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. McKelvey), who, as he said at the outset, is new to this Committee, certainly hope that you will allow the Minister to stray slightly, to ensure that the greatest possible amount of information is given to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no desire to preclude the hon. Gentleman from obtaining information, but I have a duty to see that the discussions in the Committee are in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Gourlay, for bringing me to order in over-elaborating my explanations. We strayed a little on to school councils, which, as you will agree, are the basis of the amendment, and I took the opportunity to reply to a matter of principle on the Government's view of school councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the substantial point of amendments Nos. 1 to 4, I hope that the hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire will accept that there is no impediment whatsoever in the Bill to school councils being involved in the decision-making process of helping parents to find the school that they wish for their children. If we were to accept the amendment as it stands, we would be imposing an impediment on the way in which the whole system operates. We are essentially leaving it to the education authorities to decide how they want to carry out the sifting process, the first application by a parent saying " I do not want my child to go to school X; I want him to go to school Y ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This can be a sensitive and delicate point, dealt with either by interview or by correspondence. It can be a big decision for parents to make, a very important decision. It puts a great deal of responsibility on parents. It makes them feel responsible for the decision that they are making about the child's education instead of taking the easy way out and leaving it to the local authority to decide which school their children should attend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am fully aware of the responsibility that is given to parents in this regard. I would want their approach to the local education authority to be as easy, simple, unbureaucratic and straightforward as possible. That is our intention. From what I heard the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends saying this morning, I believe that that is their intention as well. We are in complete agreement on this point, and therefore I suggest that the amendment be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find the Minister's reply almost totally unsatisfactory. It is yet another reply which has been written for him by the bureaucrats in St. Andrew's house. The Minister was paying lip service only to the whole idea of parental involvement in education. He is giving the game away. The so-called " parents' charter " which he calls the Bill is a lot of nonsense. By rejecting these amendments, the Minister will be rejecting the opportunity of having statutory provision for the involvement of parents and other community representatives who are members of the school councils to take part in the administration of the school-placing applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me, therefore, that at the heart of the discussion on the amendments there is an important principle at stake. Do we want, in our education system, simply an over-centralised bureaucracy? Or do we want a decentralised democracy? That is at the heart of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Minister that schools in Scotland do not belong to Ministers. Schools in Scotland do not belong to civil servants. Schools in Scotland do not belong to headmasters or directors of education. They belong 
	<i>to</i> the people. Clearly, to get the representatives of the people more involved in the running of the schools and in the admission procedure to the schools would be in the best interests of education in general, and indeed for the democratic organisation of our general affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

One of the few remarks which the Member made was that the school councils are statutory bodies. They were set up in 1973 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act. In my opinion, the setting up of the school councils was one of the few good aspects of what was a very bad Tory Act, a damaging Act as far as local government administration in Scotland is concerned and one which has helped to make a bureaucratic structure which, instead of bringing government closer to the people, has made it more remote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That part of the Act which set up the school councils actually decentralised power rather than overcentralised it. By setting up a system of school councils, we were ahead of our colleagues in England and Wales with regard to parental and community involvement in the running of our schools. Even to this day in most areas of Scotland we are ahead of our colleagues in England and Wales in this respect. You need only speak to hon. Members who represent constituencies south of the border to find that they are very surprised to hear that in some areas of Scotland we have a system of community representation on school councls, with representatives of parents, teachers—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I, as the Chairman, do not have any representatives on school councils. In other words. I am drawing the hon. Gentleman's attention to the use of normal parliamentary language.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not like using the royal " one " but I am sure that in 
	<i>Hansard</i> it will appear
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
as "one " rather than "you". I was not using. "you" referring to you, Mr. Gourlay; I was using "you" to refer to all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have previously drawn attention to the fact that there had been a lapse in the-use of parliamentary language which was designed for a particular purpose. It sometimes prevents horn Members from becoming overheated and rather angry. Therefore we had hoped, during this Committee, to revert to the normal practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Gourlay. I can see its point as far as some Members are concerned who do get a bit overheated and over-angry. In my case I wish that all members of the Committee were as moderate as I in putting forward my point of view. Would it be all right if I said " we have " rather than " you have "—that we have in Scotland a system of education administration in many areas which has a degree of parental and community involvement which is far superior to? that of our colleagues who represent English constituencies? Some of them are very surprised when I point out that it is a question not only of teacher and parental involvement but that we also get broader community involvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that on some school councils there are representatives from trade unions, from the trades council, from the churches and perhaps from business interests such as the Chamber of Commerce. So there is an input of experience into the administration of our education system which is very valuable indeed. The purpose of our amendments is to have it laid down in statute that we shall make use of that input of experience as far as the administration of the school placing system is concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 did not lay down in any great detail exactly what the composition of the school councils should be, what their structure should be or, indeed, what their functions should be. When they were first set up they were a bold experiment and some local education authorities seized on the opportunity to decentralise power from themselves, from their education committees in particular. Others were a bit reluctant to do so, and some of them more or less continued the former system of district education subcommittees which were the precursors of the school councils set up after the 1973 Act was passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it was only in 1974-75 that they were eventually set up, so in the light of the experience of the last six or seven years I think now is the time for the Committee to ask itself whether the school councils are doing a good job, and whether they are responsible enough to be given the devolved powers which we propose under amendments 1 to 4, which we are now discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The various functions which school councils have vary from one education authority to another. They can in some places deal with matters relating to attendance, staffing appointments, the school meals, service, primary-secondary school liaison, school-community liaison, the organisation of social functions, and, in at least one case, the administration of school-placing applications.

	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
My own constituency is split between two local education authorities, since part of my constituency is in Central region and part of it is in Strathclyde. Central region is a reasonably-sized area for a local education authority. It is not much bigger than some of the former counties which preceded the 1973 Act. Central region has chosen to have a school council system whereby the council is based on a secondary school and the feeder primaries to that secondary school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Strathclyde region is a different matter and here I am coming back to the point which I think is at the heart of the amendments—whether we want to decentralise power so far as the administration of our education system is concerned, or whether we want to overcentralise the whole administration. At the time of local government reorganisation I said that I thought it was a mistake to set up a huge authority like Strathclyde to administer personal social services such as education and social work. There may have been arguments so far as planning, particularly strategic planning, was concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think the hon. Gentleman is beginning to go a little wide of the amendment. I have allowed some reference to the composition and duties of school councils, but that should not be expanded as the hon. Gentleman is doing. Certainly his remarks should not extend to the education structure of any particular region.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point I am trying to make, Mr. Gourlay, with respect, is that Strathclyde is dealing with about half of Scotland's population of schoolchildren, and that authority has to administer placing requests, which is what we are discussing under clause 1. It is already doing this, quite apart from what will eventually happen if and when the House gives approval to the proposed legislation which we are discussing. Strathclyde has already taken off its own bat a decision to decentralise. Not everything is decided at its head office in Glasgow. Strathclyde operates a system of sub-regions for the administration of education and the size of the sub-regions is approximately the size of the former counties which were included in Strathclyde. The principle of decentralisation has already been accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Strathclyde has gone even further in the administration of school placing because it is not left to the director of education or the deputy director, nor the assistant director of education nor any of the area education officers in Strathclyde. In the first instance it is a matter for the schools councils. Its school councils are organised on an area basis rather than just on one secondary school and its feeder primaries. The school council is composed of various secondary schools in an area and their feeder primaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Strathclyde is most concerned about the provisions of this Bill. Despite what I said earlier about my
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
own doubts about whether Strathclyde is the ideal size for a local education authority, nevertheless I am sure that all hon. Members on this side would like to pay tribute to the tremendous efforts Strathclyde is making to provide a good education service for half of the school children in Scotland. That should be placed on record because perhaps that record is because it is a Labour-controlled education authority. Earlier I was criticising the structure of local government rather than any qualities or decisions which Strathclyde has made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the hon. Gentleman's description of the two different systems of school councils, one based upon a single secondary school plus feeder primaries, and the other based on a wider area set-up, one of the problems about the amendment might be that a school council dealing with a wider area would be able to mobilise resources more easily in the case of more than one secondary school, whereas in other areas a school council would only be able to offer resources to that single secondary school which is in its boundaries, and if there were difficulties about that it would not be able to extend the choice to the parents, whereas the education authority might be in a stronger position to do something because it would be operating in a similar way to the area council, or the school council, in Strathclyde. There is a bit of problem here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. If the hon. Member looks at the amendments closely, he will see that they are linked in two pairs. Nos 1 and 3 would devolve absolutely the power to the school council rather than the education authority, whereas Nos. 2 and 4 would leave the option open, so that it would be either the education authority or the school council. It may be that, in cases where a school council consists of only one secondary school and its feeder primaries, the education authority should have a wider role there, too. As a result of this clause there may be a bit of rivalry between schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been accusations that in some areas schools may acquire different reputations. Some schools may be looked upon as being very good and others as second-rate schools. Sometimes such a reputation is not entirely the schools own fault. If we were to think in terms of a school council where there was only one secondary school, we should possibly bring in the education authority or the neighbouring school councils as well. I would prefer the Committee to approve amendments Nos. 2 and 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
