	<p>
	<i>[Relevant documents: European Union Documents Nos. COM (99) 644, the Helsinki Report on Sport, and COM (99) 643, relating to doping in sport, and the Unnumbered Explanatory Memorandum dated 23rd November 2000, submitted by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, relating to the Declaration on Sport.]</i></p>

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Sport(Kate Hoey)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the European Scrutiny Committee for giving me the opportunity to debate all three documents this morning. I apologise for the delay in discussing, in particular, the Helsinki report and the Community support plan to combat doping. The position has been fluid, and it seemed sensible at the time—I appreciate that it might not seem as sensible now—to wait until firmer proposals were available. We asked for the debate to be put back until the autumn, with the expectation that the presidency would press for some form of Community instrument on sport. In the event, after lengthy deliberations, the presidency proposed the Nice declaration. It follows on from the Helsinki report, but in essence merely restates and reinforces the position of sport in the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government believe, and I personally feel strongly, that sport should not be subject to undue interference by the Commission or national Governments. Governments, at whatever level, do not and should not run sport, which is unique in its importance to people in all sectors of our society and in its wider social and health benefits. It has the ability to bring people together and to generate a sense of community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, sport is also an important business, or at least the professional leagues in some sports are. They are significant employers and generators of wealth, often engaged in an international market. It is inevitable that regulations that apply to commercial activity should apply in some instances to that sector of sport. However, even professional sport has a particular place in our national life and in local communities. It has special characteristics, and European rules and regulations must be applied in a way that is sensitive to the special needs of sport. There is a need to invest in young talent to ensure that the richer institutions and sports clubs support the smaller, less commercially successful ones. There is also a need to ensure that there is strong investment in grass-roots sport, which is the bedrock of all our sporting activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The Scrutiny Committee's comments on the Helsinki report ask for greater clarity on the Government's stance on sport in Europe. In particular, the Committee calls for clarity on how European treaty provisions should impact on sport. Our line on that is consistent and clear: there is no need for direct competence for sport under the European treaty. We worked hard to ensure that any form of words in the declaration on sport was consistent with our belief that there is no need for a specific legal base for community action on sport. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister backed that message.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the acknowledgement of the special nature of sport in the various declarations, but also feel that the independence of sporting associations should be respected. We accept, however, that commercial aspects of sport should be subject to Community law, applied in a way that recognises the special characteristics of the particular activity. It is not necessary or desirable to make a total exception for sport in all its commercial aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The declaration on sport, which was agreed by Heads of Government at Nice just before Christmas, reflects the common feeling that the existing framework makes sufficient provision for the interests of sport to be protected. Of course, we will be certain of that only when we have more experience of the rules being applied. The present consideration of football transfer fees is an important test case whose progress we are monitoring closely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Scrutiny Committee report on the Helsinki report pays particular attention to issues surrounding the Bosman case and freedom of movement following that ruling in 1995. The Commission's concerns about the effects of the present FIFA transfer system on competition in football are legitimate. The Commission is obliged to investigate complaints and is bound to consider whether the present transfer framework is in accordance with the EU treaty. That arose originally after a complaint was made to the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although any revised transfer system is first and foremost a matter for football, the Government are supporting the United Kingdom football authorities as negotiations continue. We want an outcome that supports the smaller clubs, encourages youth development and affords stability to the sport. The inclusion in the Nice declaration, at UK insistence, of a paragraph specifically on transfers is further evidence of the importance that the Government attach to obtaining a universally satisfactory outcome on transfers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Scrutiny Committee commented that it was awaiting the Select Committee's report on work permits. Last year the report of the Select Committee on Education and Employment on footballers' work permits called for quotas on footballers from the European economic area and non-EEA countries. As Department for Education and Employment Ministers noted in their reply, existing rules on the free movement of labour throughout the EEA must be respected. The DFEE's work permit criteria for football are based on international appearances and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0388">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
other factors designed to ensure that only top quality players may compete in domestic UK competitions. Other sports are affected by these rules, and the Committee may be interested to know that I have met with representatives of ice hockey and basketball to discuss that. They have agreed to work with DFEE Ministers on some of the issues that affect those sports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rules on the inclusion of non-EEA players are primarily a matter for sport, and colleagues in the DFEE have reported back to the Select Committee to that effect. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is kept informed of the progress of regular discussions between the DFEE and UK governing bodies, as well meeting with them ourselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the European Scrutiny Committee's comments on the community support plan to combat doping. My proposal at the Council of Europe Sports Ministers' meeting in May last year to appoint Suvi Linden, the Finnish Sports Minister, to the World Anti-Doping Agency board was agreed unanimously by all countries represented at the meeting. That helped the work on WADA to resume after some months of stagnation during discussions about membership of the board. We felt that it was important that the setting up of WADA should not be held up by infighting about who would be represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two members from the European Union to represent WADA and two members of the Council of Europe on the WADA board. I should reiterate that the EU has no direct competence in sport, and in the fight against doping in sport the EU should deal only with such issues in so far as they relate to areas of competence such as public health, research and education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom has previously rejected the proposal that one of the EU seats on the WADA board be filled by the Commission on those grounds, and on the grounds that work on WADA had been carried out on an intergovernmental, rather than a Community, basis. However, after a great deal of discussion with other European members and in the interests of cooperation, it has now been agreed that the Commission should be on the WADA board, but only under certain safeguards. Again, we have worked with other member states to ensure that those were in place and that the role of the Commission was within the existing competency of European law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commissioner will have a limited role on the WADA board on behalf of the EU. She will represent member states on issues where there is competence and will speak on other matters only if specifically mandated to do so by agreement between member states. A European liaison committee has been established to co-ordinate the views of member states and mandate any delegation. The declaration of sport and our involvement in discussions over EU representation on WADA is evidence of the UK working effectively with other member states to progress the issues outlined in the Helsinki report within the framework of the existing treaty. We will continue this work with a view to ensuring that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
special place of sport in our lives continues to be recognised and that sport retains its integrity and autonomy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have until 11.30 for questions. I gently remind hon. Members that it is helpful if only one question is asked at a time. I am prepared to allow a little leeway to the Opposition Front Bench. I shall call members of the Committee first, and then non-members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Greenway
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ryedale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --> </div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you for your comments, Mr. Gale. I welcome the Minister's introductory statement, which we shall delve into in a little more detail during our short debate. We particularly welcome the Minister's confirmation that the EU and its institutions have no direct competence in sport and that the Government will resist any proposals to alter that arrangement. I agree that when other competences of the Community and its institutions impact on sport, that can lead to problems—as with football transfer fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall ask the Minister a couple of direct questions and expand on them later. Does she acknowledge that, prior to the Nice summit, briefings from Downing street suggested that the Prime Minister, Chancellor SchrÖder of Germany and other EU Heads of Government favoured a special derogation for sport with respect to EU employment and competition law, as a means of resolving the transfer fees dispute? Will she confirm that, although the reference to transfer fees in annexe 4 of the treaty document is welcome, it provides no specific derogation on transfer fees? It offers support through the continuation of dialogue and encouragement for the Community's institutions regarding the specific requirements of sport, but compliance with Community law remains an important principle to be observed in any agreed solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current dispute has, sadly, embittered relations between UEFA and FIFA over the past 48 hours, and the Minister will share my anxiety about that. Does she accept that the Government have an important role to play and that political dialogue as well as dialogue between the governing bodies of sport and the Commission is necessary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. No special derogation was requested. We asked only for the special nature of sport to be recognised. There seems to be deadlock over the transfer issue. Several players are involved: UEFA, FIFA, the Commission and the players' unions. If sporting authorities want to be seen as responsible for everyone in and affected by the sport, they must speak with one voice. In this country, our football authorities do speak with one voice and they have made their position clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Discussions are going on and compromises will have to be made. The bottom line for our football authorities is that whatever transfer system is finally agreed, it must allow money to pass through to the lower end of the game, and it must protect the assets invested in players so that clubs do not lose them. Despite the existence of a contract, some clubs sometimes sell a player who does not want to move.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0389">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
The issue is complicated because the rights of individual sportsmen must be balanced against the overall good of the sport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is first and foremost for the football authorities to get their act together, but we all know that FIFA took a long time to respond to the sensible requests put to it. The Commission was asked to examine a particular legal case, but FIFA responded very late in the day. Unfortunately, hype and media can be exploited to put across individual bodies' cases. In this country, the football authorities and the Government have been clear in their approach, and all hon. Members are likely to share our desire to maintain the best elements of the transfer system. We shall continue to work closely with all interested parties to secure that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always a pleasure to welcome my parliamentary neighbour to the Chair, Mr. Gale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Doping in sport is reprehensible, but many of the compounds used for that purpose are legal and ethical in other contexts. Members of the Committee may be taking cold cures that would break the rules if they were used by sportsmen during a sporting event. That is why it is left to sporting associations to regulate such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can my hon. Friend assure me that nothing in the regulations will encourage the European Union and its Commissioners to try to proscribe the use of compounds? They have no right to proscribe them, because they are legal in other contexts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: WADA's responsibilities will be more about the co-ordination of regulatory measures and the sharing of information, such as how countries can learn from each other how the anti-doping system works, the testing methods used and so on. Although WADA is a European Union-based agency, we will not fight doping in sport by seeing it only as a European Union issue. We must take a wider view; that is why the Council of Europe is so important. Many of the problems involving doping and drugs in sport exist outside the European Union. We should not get the idea that members of the European Union, by agreeing one way of doing something, will somehow affect the rest of the world; that is why WADA—an international body—was set up. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that sport itself must take the lead. It is not a simple matter of producing lists that will affect all sports, because all sports are different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jack
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fylde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The confusing pile of documents sent to members of the Committee emanates from the European Scrutiny Committee. Its commentary on the matter in paragraph 6.9 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>The Treaty contains no specific provisions on sport, but in order to ensure that Community law such as competition law and the principles of the internal market are respected, accompanying "co-ordination or interpretation measures" might prove useful, the Commission suggests.</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
As there is a relationship in the documents between policy on sport and, for example, competition law, can the Minister tell me whether there are any plans to investigate the stranglehold on formula one motor racing in the Community, as exhibited by FISA and Mr. Bernie Ecclestone?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter for the European Commission legal paraphernalia, if I may so describe it. The Commission is looking at competition problems, especially those relating to the motor racing industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that I may understand with greater clarity, will the Minister say how the Community proposes to develop its uncertain position on sport? How exactly will it pursue the questions asked about FISA's monopolistic practices in formula one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what the hon. Gentleman wants me to say. Clearly, whether a particular practice within a sport or the way in which a sport organises its commercial functions is contrary to the Commission's regulations, is a matter for the Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Greenway</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The best way forward for the Minister, for me and for the Committee would be to return to the transfer issue during the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the hon. Lady's comment—if I understood her correctly—that the Government believe that the European Commission is not the right body to deal with the doping issue. The Minister appeared to say that the representatives of the new institutions on WADA will be restricted to considering only those matters that impinge on Community law and competence. I shall be grateful if the hon. Lady will confirm that my understanding of what she said is correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the hon. Lady also confirm that it remains the Government's position that there should be no funding of WADA through European Union institutions, because of the lack of Euro-competence? Will she therefore reaffirm her support for United Kingdom anti-doping programmes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Helsinki report refers to the different anti-doping legislation of member states as a barrier to free movement. Does the Minister share my scepticism about that and does she agree that it can hardly be a barrier to free movement of athletes, for example, when they represent their country of birth—they can represent only their own country in national teams—and do not, as in professional football, swap from one country to another?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is getting a little difficult; the hon. Member and I are agreeing on practically everything. I confirm what he has just said. I also repeat that we will accept Commission involvement in WADA only where there is clearly a legal competency—which is very restricted at the moment. I see no reason why that would change. Any funding of WADA by the Commission must have a sound legal base and should never be at the expense of diverting funds from other priority areas. The funding of WADA is primarily a matter for member states. If the costs of WADA were
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0390">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
divided between all the countries of the world—accepting that some are not as well off as others—each country would need to pay only a tiny amount. If we cannot collectively find that money to fight doping in sport, that says something about our attitude to sport. I do not believe that we will take that attitude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Minister and the Opposition spokesman are agreeing, I shall take the opportunity of the Whip's absence to introduce a controversial matter. The fifth framework programme on research is meant to encourage medical research and research into high-energy physics to encourage EU industries to be competitive in those areas. Is my hon. Friend happy that the report suggests that some of the resources for that programme be diverted into such areas as doping and doping detection? Does she think that that is an appropriate use of the fifth framework programme? Does she not think that we should encourage sport rather than the European Union to undertake that research?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right; sport has its role to play. Sporting bodies in this country already pay indirectly for anti-doping measures. The priority given to anti-doping measures within EU funding must be considered in the research to which my hon. Friend referred. The research that is undertaken must be broadly accepted by all member states. Provided the funding is within the framework of research, development and education, I see no reason why EU money should not be used for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bob Russell
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Colchester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Community support plan to combat doping in sport states that the differences in anti-doping legislation between member states may constitute a barrier to the free movement of professional and amateur sports people. Is the Minister aware of any evidence to support that statement in regard to UK sports and sports people?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I have not seen any such evidence, but someone obviously thinks that it exists. I will make it my business to find out what the evidence is. I would be interested in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In her opening remarks, the Minister questioned, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway), the competency of the Commission to act in this area. Paragraph 10 of her Department's explanatory memorandum on the Helsinki report on sport says that
	<br><blockquote><p>There is currently no direct Community competence in sport.</p></blockquote>
The communication from the Commission on doping matters, COM (99) 643, which is in the document before the Committee, states in paragraph 5:
	<br><blockquote><p>Article 152</p></blockquote>
would
	<br><blockquote><p>provide a basis for increased coordination of policies on doping in sport.</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister explain the apparent paradox between her Department's assertion that there is no competency and the Commission's assertion that article 152 gives it comfort in this area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one is suggesting that there is no legal base for co-operation on aspects of anti-doping. That is different from the Commission making decisions on how the fight against doping will be fought. The two are not contradictory. Article 152 is, first and foremost, about public health, which is different from anti-doping. It could be argued that the health of people who take drugs might be affected in the long term, but the fight against drugs in sport is not, fundamentally, a public health issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister challenges article 152 in this context, will she tell the Committee whether, on the grounds of competency, the Government propose to challenge article 152 as being the legal base? Will she clarify the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not challenging article 152. We are saying that the Commission has a legal base on specific public health aspects of anti-doping, but not on the whole range of measures covering testing procedures, international standards, co-operation and persuading international bodies to sign up to agreed testing procedures. Those are not public health issues. The public health issues are along the lines suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) and include research into the many different food supplements and how to clarify what they contain. Many of the problems concerning drugs in sport have arisen from such matters and they are public health issues because anyone can go into a chemist and buy food supplements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Greenway</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could help the Minister in response to the point that I and the hon. Member for Colchester made earlier. Paragraph 3 on page 5 of the introduction to the document on anti-doping refers to a three-pronged approach. I am happy to lend my copy of the document to the Minister because the papers are complex and repetitive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a question on another matter, on which I suspect the Minister and I will not be in agreement. During her opening comments she referred to work permits for overseas players and referred specifically to ice hockey. I understand that only seven British-born players play in the highest ice hockey league in this country. Is she aware of the concern of the Institute of Professional Sport that current work permit arrangements—they are the responsibility not of the Minister but of the Department for Education and Employment—are a movable feast? It is very difficult to monitor overseas players in all sports in this country without clear guidelines from that Department on what is permitted under the rules. In that regard, will she clarify the Government's view on quotas? Is she aware that the Football Association is increasingly coming round to the view that quotas may be the only solution?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, does the hon. Lady agree that players who come to this country from outside the European Union should be of a high standard, and that while we have a work permit system, only players who are likely to play a full complement of matches should be allowed into the country? We should not bring in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0391">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
overseas players to the extent of denying our own young and talented players the opportunity to participate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of the Institute of Professional Sport and have met its representatives to discuss the matter. It works closely with ice hockey, which is in an especially difficult position. I share the hon. Gentleman's worries about that. Given that it is an increasingly popular sport involving substantial amounts of money at professional level, it is sad if young players in this country do not have the opportunity to develop their talent and involvement. Despite the rule that a certain number of British players must be on the bench, the vast majority of people in professional ice hockey teams are from other countries. Difficulties have arisen over people from Canada, for example, who come here, play for a certain number of years and then manage to secure British citizenship)—although I am not an expert on how they do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are serious about developing ice hockey and creating a pathway from the bottom to the top, we must ensure that it is played in this country. No public money should go into the game unless there is a clearly defined method of developing home-grown talent. I am considering a case in Northern Ireland—where I come from originally—in which the new ice hockey team set up in Belfast, which is entering the league, contains not a single British player. The hon. Gentleman will be pleased to know that the permit system for ice hockey players is to be reviewed and that a meeting will soon take place between DFEE officials and the governing body. I shall keep a close eye on that, although, as he says, it is the responsibility of the DFEE.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On football, the DFEE has invited the FA to produce proposals on quotas. As the hon. Gentleman said, the FA is changing its views on that matter. The Department may be willing to accept a non-EEA quota with a quality threshold. Initially, however, quotas must be a matter for sport's governing bodies, because the position varies widely between sports.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have no desire to stifle discussion by curtailing question time, but there is a danger that it will consist entirely of exchanges between the Front Benches, with occasional interventions from the Back Benches, instead of a series of crisp questions and answers. I sense that members of the Committee wish shortly to move on to the debate. That will not curtail the amount of available time, but it will allow a little more flexibility from the Chair's point of view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister turn to the annex attached to the conclusions of the last Nice European Council, which contains a series of paragraphs about amateur sport and sport for all? What progress is being made in that respect, and are there any plans objectively to monitor member states' achievements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: European Union Sports Ministers meet regularly and discuss just such matters. My European work as a Home Office Minister involved competency and tended to be formally structured. I have found that Sports Ministers have excellent working relationships because there is no competency for sport and we can work in a more informal manner. We shall continue to monitor that, regardless of what is happening at Commission level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We obtained huge changes to the declaration, which was initially filled with gobbledegook that the Commission had thoughtlessly produced without considering the views of the amateur sports clubs affected. I must take a position on the matter, and I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman takes a similar view. I always consider, "How will this affect Joe Bloggs' boxing club, judo club or darts club?" That is where the EU Sports Ministers obtain their mandates. We shall keep a close eye on the matter because we want sport to develop throughout the European Union, and we want everyone to have a chance to participate. However, each country has its own way of doing things, so the process will not be entirely harmonious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In her opening statement, my hon. Friend said that UK rules on foreign footballers were intended to ensure that only high-quality players came to play in Britain. I can assure her that the rules are not working. As a regular supporter of smaller football clubs such as Margate—where we shared a terrace, Mr. Gale—and Ramsgate, can my hon. Friend assure the Committee that during negotiations on the transfer system both the European Union and the Government will adopt the fundamental principle that, whatever system is put in place, money will still flow down to the smaller clubs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an absolute commitment. The Commission has recently stated that it wants money to flow down to the lowest levels of the game, such as the Unibond league.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the hope of being clearer in my probing about formula one, may I ask the Minister to turn to paragraph 14 of the Nice Council declaration. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>In the view of the European Council, single ownership or financial control of more than one sports club entering the same competition in the same sport may jeopardise fair competition.</p></blockquote>
Is the Commission looking to that agenda in terms of formula one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the EC Competition Authority is currently considering a complaint about FISA, the international governing body of motor sport, and we await its statement. Paragraph 14 is the section of the declaration that allows such discussion because it clearly relates to single ownership and monopoly interests, which are the essence of the complaint about FISA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the Minister would explain a sentence in paragraph 15 of the declaration. On the subject of television broadcasting rights, it states:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0392">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>The European Council thinks that moves to encourage the mutualisation of part of the revenue from such sales, at the appropriate levels, are beneficial to the principle of solidarity between all levels and areas of sport.</p></blockquote>
What does that mean?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure you, Mr. Gale, that you would have found the first draft, or even the second draft, even worse. This is something that we are keen to see happen. As is already the case in Britain, it should be agreed that a percentage of the money that has entered sports such as rugby, cricket, football and tennis as a consequence of television rights ought to go to the grass roots. Rugby, cricket and tennis do that already, and more recently football has come on board by establishing that 5 per cent, of the money received from television will go to the grass roots. No other country in Europe is doing that, and when I discussed it at the Council of Europe, Ministers to whom I spoke were amazed that we were able to secure that money. However, it must be said that much of the lead has come from the governing bodies themselves. They recognise that, if one is to become and remain successful, one must nourish the grass roots.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since no more Members wish to ask questions, we will proceed to the debate on the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.10am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Sport (Kate Hoey)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. COM (99) 643, a Commission Communication entitled 'Community Support Plan to Combat Doping in Sport', European Union Document No. COM (99) 644, the Helsinki Report on Sport, and the unnumbered Explanatory Memorandum dated 23rd November 2000, submitted by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, relating to the Declaration on Sport; considers that the special nature and role of sport should be recognised in applying Community rules to sporting activity; and supports the Government's intention to ensure that Europe is effectively represented in the deliberations of the World Anti-Doping Agency.</p></blockquote>
The motion is fairly clear and brings together the various points that we have discussed. In a sense, it signifies support for the way in which we are handling sport in Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.11am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Greenway
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ryedale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --> </div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A wide range of debates takes place in the various forums in this place, but is always good to be able to debate sport. Just before Christmas, when I first got an inkling that we would have this debate, I began to wonder what on earth we would talk about. However, the timing has in fact proved extremely helpful, because it enables us to exchange views on the vexed matter of football transfer fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the situation in respect of transfer fees is extremely serious. I have to make the political point that, rightly or wrongly, many people in football were led to understand that something had been done about the matter at the Nice summit, and that all would be well in the long run. Had the agreement been concluded between FIFA, UEFA and the European Commission—at that juncture, it appeared to be within reach—the question of whether
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
the footballing world had misunderstood, or been misled about, events at Nice would have been academic. However, that question is not academic now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scale of concern about this matter was exemplified by an interview on Radio 5 Live on Monday evening with the Leeds United chairman, Peter Ridsdale. If the Minister did not hear it, I am sure that she can obtain a transcript. He said that, although it was his understanding that the Prime Minister and Chancellor SchrÖder had sorted out the matter at Nice, it was now clear that that was not the case. That is relevant to this debate, as I pointed out in my first question. Although we welcome an annexe to the Nice treaty relating specifically to sport, and although we particularly welcome the Minister's reassurance that the Government and the official Opposition remain as one in resisting any attempt by Community institutions to obtain any competence in sport, the fact remains that the Commission's view of the impact of European economic and employment law on our football transfer fee system is likely, if not resolved to the satisfaction of everyone in football, to cause devastation to professional football in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister shares entirely our concern about this matter. During the latest behind-the-scenes manoeuvring at the Commission, Commissioner Monti, who will take the final decision in this matter, proposed not even to discuss that decision with the full Commission prior to its adoption. That worries me. If the whole Commission were to discuss it, our own two Commissioners would be able to have an input, at least, into the final outcome. Moreover, sell-on clauses to reward training clubs, which were in the original document, now appear to be lost. I cannot produce any written evidence of that, but that is the advice that Members of the European Parliament have given me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, there is alarm at Commissioner Reding's recent comments about treating the functioning of the existing domestic system in parallel with international arrangements. That is important, because I understand that one of the fail-safes propagated by the Commission is concerned only with international transfers and not with domestic ones. The Minister would be the first to accept that the knock-on effect on domestic transfers would be very real, as we have seen from the outcome of the Bosman case. I do not want to create a rift between us on the matter, because it is abundantly clear that we agree on the need to support the football authorities in this country. She is right to say that the Premier League, the Football League and the FA speak as one. I also agree that we need to bring FIFA on side, and that it is vital to protect the interests of smaller clubs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, a clear conflict of aspiration has been revealed in the Commission. The Minister's entire speech was about the Commission's concern for and interest in the grass roots and the need to ensure that they receive investment. However, if the Commission has its way on football transfers, it will achieve the opposite; the grass-roots clubs will be devastated. That encourages me to believe that, in the end, common sense will prevail. I emphasise, however, that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0393">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
matter will not be resolved without further political input. I think that the FA agrees with me, and I am sure that the Minister is in contact with it. I appeal to the Minister to encourage the Prime Minister to turn his mind to the matter once again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does it concern the hon. Gentleman as much as it concerns me that the final decision on the matter will be taken by Commissioner Monti? He is an academic and tends to take purist decisions, based on academic principles. His record shows that he does not bend too much towards common sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Greenway</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I take as read everything that he said about Commissioner Monti, but it is useful to have that contribution on the record. I drew attention to the suggestion that Commissioner Monti alone would take the final decision, which is one reason why I strongly believe that further political involvement is needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Prime Minister and Chancellor Schröder could not sort out the matter at Nice because there was an formal process in the Commission that none of the member states could stop. However, everyone made it clear at that meeting, and at many meetings behind the scenes, that the issue was important and that the solution had to protect the interests of football as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned a treaty change. Even if a change had gone through, it would not have come into effect for two years and would not have stopped the Commission continuing with its proposal. I agree with the hon. Gentleman; common sense will prevail, but more political input may be needed. We are prepared to take that risk if necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Greenway</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that confirmation. Following my visit to the Commission in late October, my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition made it clear that we would support a derogation, but I acknowledge the difficulties—particularly the problem of whether derogation would infringe employment law within member states. Germany, for example, has experienced some difficulties in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today's debate is opportune. Any notion that the Nice summit would help to resolve the matter has been shot to pieces by what has happened in the past 48 hours. The clear rift between FIFA and UEFA has revealed sharp differences of approach to the problem. It is no secret that other member countries of FIFA—in south America, the far east and Africa—view the opportunity for their people to play in European leagues as valuable because it can enhance the quality and reputation of their national teams. If a player such as Kanu, who plays for the club supported by the Minister and me, leaves Arsenal on three months' notice, he is likely to move on to play for Real Madrid, Manchester United or another top club, so he will
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
continue to take part in European competitions. FIFA members can have different attitudes and approaches from UEFA members—hence the split.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for acknowledging the need for political input. Clubs at the lower end must not suffer from a lack of proper resources, which is damaging for the training and encouragement of young players. Players must not be allowed to walk out, willy-nilly, after just one year, as proposed by FIFA. The Minister knows that UEFA prefers three years. The one-year option would be a disaster for association football in this country. The Commission's objectives could be completely undermined and we could end up with precisely the reverse of what is required. Smaller communities and clubs such as Halifax, Carlisle United—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bob Russell
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Colchester) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: York City?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Greenway</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even York City—let us make no bones about it. Clubs at the bottom end, and the communities that support them, will be the losers if the problems are not resolved to everyone's satisfaction. We should continue to work together and avoid making it a partisan matter, although it is essential to press the Prime Minister to do whatever he can to help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall amplify some of the issues that were raised earlier. On work permits for overseas players, I welcome the Minister's reply and her acknowledgement that there is a problem. She announced a review of work permits in respect of ice hockey, but should not the DFEE review the work permit system across a whole range of sports? The hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) succinctly explained that the present system is not working. We agree, and it is particularly injurious for the future of young players—of rugby and basketball, as well as football. It is difficult to create the best league in the world without the talent. It is a vicious circle. Unless our younger players are given opportunities, we will always have to import talent from overseas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have nothing against overseas players coming here. On the contrary, I have on many occasions defended their involvement, particularly in the Premier league. They have enriched our league so that it can now stand shoulder to shoulder with the Bundesliga, Serie A in Italy and the Spanish league. Three English teams are in the second phase of the European Champions league, which would not have been likely five years ago. There are some benefits, but equally there are disadvantages. I encourage the Minister to continue to take a healthy interest in this matter so that we can have a clear and transparent system of work permits that is open to challenge by professional sporting bodies if they believe that a wrong decision has been taken. They do not feel that they can do that at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Minister's comments about the work of WADA. I have one question. About this time last year, she issued a press release welcoming a UK Sport report in nandrolone and commented that Professor James had produced a valuable report. However, she added that there would be a further Government
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0394">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
report in due course. When is that likely to be published and do the Government intend to publish any more information on this matter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) asked about economic support for sport, particularly sponsorship. The Minister will be aware that the Bill to ban tobacco advertising, which is to receive its Second Reading next Tuesday, has an impact on the sponsorship of sport by tobacco companies. We all watched the Embassy darts championships at the weekend. I am not clear who will sponsor those championships in years to come and neither are the darts authorities. We generally accept that the ban is now a 
	<i> fait accompli.</i> The Government have decided to take this action and I simply encourage the Minister to continue to help the sports that are affected to find alternative sponsors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is growing anxiety that the next target for an advertising ban will be alcohol. A similar ban on the sponsorship of sporting events by the drinks industry would be an absolute disaster for many sports in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman happy that unhealthy substances such as tobacco and alcohol should be associated with a healthy pastime?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Greenway</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to get into a debate about whether such advertising encourages further uptake of these products, but they are legal products. The drinks industry in this country is huge and makes a welcome contribution to football in particular. We cannot have it both ways. We cannot say that we are concerned about the transfer fee system and getting money down to the grass roots of sports through broadcasting rights and then say that we are happy to see a ban on sponsorship of sport by the drinks industry. That would have a devastating effect on the sports that we are trying to protect. We must be consistent in our arguments. As we would expect, the Minister has regular contact with her counterparts in other EU Governments. I raise the matter today to encourage her to keep a wary eye on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards broadcasting rights in themselves, which are referred to in the documents, I would simply encourage the Minister and her European counterparts not to go down the road of the Commission in legislating specific levies, quotas or taxes from sporting rights sales to be put into sport. We should continue to do what we have been doing in this country extremely successfully through the Central Council for Physical Recreation; a voluntary agreement on sporting rights sales to encourage more and more money from broadcasting to be put down to the grass roots. What has been happening in cricket and tennis is excellent. Football now has seen the light and at long last we are going to see that money trickle down through the Football Foundation to the grass roots. We reflect on what we have been able to achieve in this country and would encourage other European Union member states and European institutions to follow our example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Grogan
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Selby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --> </div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to draw attention to the Helsinki report on sport, where the Community does have a legal framework in terms of broadcasting. The "Television without frontiers" directive is referred to in paragraph 6.11 of the management memorandum on the Helsinki report, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>On the other hand, measures which are taken which are in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity are strengthening the legal framework, such as the decision to provide for Member States to ensure that the general public has access to major sporting events, in the "Television without Frontiers" Directive.</p></blockquote>
That encourages member states—indeed, it demands of them—to recognise each other's listed sporting events which must be made available to the general public, broadly on terrestrial television. The Minister was involved in the review group that the Government set up in our early days in office which greatly expanded the list of events in this country that must be available, or must be offered, to terrestrial television.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to focus on one event, the football World cup, to illustrate how important that is. In this country, much more so than the rest of Europe, all football World cup finals matches are listed and must be available to terrestrial television. This is not true in the rest of Europe. Now, for the first time, FIFA is guaranteeing only that the final, the semi-finals and matches involving host nations must be available to terrestrial television viewers. In the context of the United Kingdom, where would that leave Wales? The last time Wales qualified for the World cup was in 1958. Without the protection of our list, Wales could be faced with the prospect of just the final and the semifinals being available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Jamaica competed in the last World cup. Without going into Norman Tebbit's cricket test, a great deal of our population took great delight in those matches which would not have been available if FIFA had had its way. The protection is absolutely crucial. The Helsinki report refers to the fact that during the last World cup, there were nearly 600 million television viewers worldwide per match, on average; a total of 37 billion television viewers worldwide. Those figures do an awful lot; not just for those at the top of the sport, but in terms of inspiring people to take up football and other sports at all levels. When FIFA announced that it was going to offer television rights on an exclusive basis to satellite broadcasters—with the exception of a very few matches such as the final—it said:
	<br><blockquote><p>The 2002 FIFA World Cup will be more widely available to broadcasters than ever before.</p></blockquote>
That is crucial, and is repeated twice. FIFA is concerned about broadcasters, not fans. It recognises that World Cup football transcends all other football games. It consolidates audiences like no other sport, with breathtaking viewing figures that add up to billions. It is watched by men, women, children and grandparents. It appeals to people from every walk of life. It can empty the streets of traffic and can fill major cities with jubilant fans. During the 1998 World cup, restaurants along Queensway in Bayswater, the area of

west London where I have a flat, had televisions so that people could watch the World cup. That would not be possible if the matches were broadcast only on satellite and cable television.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I bring that to the Committee's attention because of the "Television without frontiers" directive. Obviously, the directive impinges on competition, but it is essential. In Spain, World cup rights have been sold to a satellite company called Via Digital; in Germany, only 24 of the 62 matches will be available on terrestrial television. In Italy, France and Britain, negotiations have not been concluded, but it is an Anglo-German contest, like so many things in sport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Mr. Kirsch has bought the television rights from FIFA for £1 billion and, like most contests of that nature, it will probably go to extra time and penalties. The BBC and ITV got together and told Mr. Kirsch that they were prepared to pay him $50 million. However, he wants $250 million for the British rights, which is about 20 times what it cost last time. His agents, Prisma, are trying to persuade the Commission to rule the BBC and ITV joint negotiations out of order. According to the 
	<i>Daily Mail,</i> the Commission has said that it is in order for the BBC and ITV to negotiate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that those negotiations will be successful; if they are not, the matter will go to the Independent Television Commission for arbitration. The ITC would have to decide, for the first time, whether rights to a major sporting event such as the World cup could be sold to Sky, for example. It will have to decide whether the BBC and ITV had made a reasonable offer on the criteria of previous fees for the event, the time of live coverage—the next World cup is to be held in Japan and Korea, which means that live broadcasts in this country will be in the middle of the night—and the period for which the rights were offered. The ITC will have to take an important decision, which will affect many of our constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is important throughout Europe. TV Denmark, a broadcaster that has been set up in this country and which broadcasts by satellite to Denmark, has bought the rights to the away games of the Danish national football team—all its competitive matches are listed—and is trying to broadcast them by satellite to Denmark. The "Television without frontiers" directive comes into play in that case because the television company is registered in Britain. The ITC ruled against TV Denmark, saying that it was not right to try to get round the European directive in that way. The High Court backed the ITC but the Appeal Court backed TV Denmark. The case will go to the House of Lords later this year. Members of the Committee and the Government should watch the outcome of the case and decide how robust the directive is, because the enjoyment of so many people in this country watching events such as the World cup depends upon it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bob Russell
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Colchester) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) on putting his case so powerfully. We are told to ensure that the general public have access to major sporting events via television, but "access" depends upon someone having the facility or the money to purchase major sporting events. I urge the Minister to consider that in her deliberations in the United Kingdom and with her European Union colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious that, unless major sporting events are readily available, as the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) said, much interest in sport will be lost. It may be in the short-term interest of some major sporting events and organisations to reap the money that is coming in, but if that money is not invested, or if televised sporting events are not more widely available, the next generation might not be interested and yet more sports could be added to those that are currently described as minority sports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who look to a wider European ideal, and who sometimes feel that Europe is too often treated as a political football, sincerely believe that Europe has scored an own goal in respect of the Bosman ruling and associated transfer matters. In terms of that wider ideal, we find such decisions a turn-off. In her deliberations with Ministers and others, I hope that the Minister will pass on the message that the man on the terrace does not take too kindly to having his sport mucked about with in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not realise that the hon. Member for Ryedale, who expressed support for York City, is in fact an Arsenal supporter. Those of us who are proud to support our so-called small town teams—I am proudly wearing a Colchester United tie—know that they could not survive without the opportunity to sell certain players. In that regard, the Bosman ruling and other such rulings are a cause for concern. According to yesterday's 
	<i>Metro,</i> Peter Ridsdale, the chairman of Leeds United,
	<br><blockquote><p>warned of 'potential disaster' for small clubs if the row between UEFA and FIFA means the current transfer system cannot be saved.</p></blockquote>
Mr. Ridsdale said:
	<br><blockquote><p>I don't believe there should be any changes to the transfer system anyway.</p></blockquote>
According to the 
	<i>Metro,</i> he fears that
	<br><blockquote><p>many clubs will lose out on vital revenue if they cannot rely on being able to sell players as they do under the current set-up.</p></blockquote>
Mr. Ridsdale concludes by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>I think it's potentially a disaster for the sport.</p></blockquote>
A few months ago, my local team managed to sell a player, Lomana Tresor Lua Lua—a good old Essex name—to Newcastle United for £2.25 million. Although the money generated by that transfer does not guarantee Colchester United's survival for the next few years, its financial circumstances are certainly a lot better now than they were. If some of the Europe-related fears that we hear about are realised, many small clubs—I am thinking of, say, Ramsgate and Margate—will not get that revenue because the game will not generate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0396">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
I hope that the Minister will speak to her ministerial, European and sporting colleagues, and persuade the Prime Minister to renegotiate with the German Chancellor. The ordinary football supporter does not want the game as we know it to be destroyed, but it is being destroyed by television and the mass importation of overseas players. In my view—and here is my only area of disagreement with the hon. Member for Ryedale—excessive purchasing of overseas players has been to the detriment of the British game, and we are reaping the whirlwind through our poor performance at international level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the various statements that were made today, particularly in relation to doping. There must be a pan-European, worldwide approach, and I am grateful for the Minister's confirmation that, as far as she is aware, the UK's strict rules and regulations on doping have presented no difficulties for our sportsmen and women, or for those who visit this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ryedale mentioned darts, and I would like the Minister to find out how many European Union countries recognise it as a sport. Although it is arguably the most popular sport in this country, it is not—unlike such mass crowd-pullers as korfball—recognised as such. More than 100 activities are recognised as a sport, but darts is not—although any broadcaster, newspaper or darts player will say that it is. Now that we are in the third millennium, we should do away with the snobbishness of the 20th century and recognise darts as a sport. It would be interesting to know how Britain's attitude to darts compares with that of our European colleagues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should talk to the Minister. She was at the darts final at the weekend—so she, as Sports Minister, recognises it as a sport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Russell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no problems with the Minister. Without wishing to betray any secrets, she and I are involved in discussions on the subject. Nevertheless, I wanted to take this opportunity to put my views on the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, until now I had assumed that the European Group on Ethics was an organisation formed by someone with a lisp to promote my county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point concerns school sports and education. The Minister will be aware that, at best only 25 per cent, of young people at school participate in physical education within school curriculum time. It is an area in which the Government are failing, as successive Governments have failed. We must all take some responsibility for that, my party included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am talking about not only the recognised sports that we want to encourage, but fitness and well-being. The situation cannot be left as it is. A consequence of our unhealthy nation is that young people are less fit than our generation. The first thing that the Army does when it recruits a young man or woman is to check whether they are fit enough to undertake the training. It is at school, within the curriculum, that the whole ethos of physical education is nurtured and encouraged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
I urge the Minister to find out—through European directives or discussions that she has outside the UK—why other countries do better than us in terms of physical education at school. As a start, let us establish a target of ensuring that every young child participates in physical education for a minimum of two hours a week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Darvill
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Upminster)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the motion and welcome the debate, although I found all the pages difficult to marshal. A few pages seemed to be missing, but, having read through them, I found that they were all there. Overall, the process took longer than it would have done had the material been better organised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I broadly congratulate the Government on their approach, which strikes the right balance at both EU and UK level. I especially welcome the announcements over the past year regarding sports co-ordinators, who will play a positive role in local communities. That goes some way towards addressing the worries expressed by the hon. Member for Colchester (Mr. Russell).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to take up the point made by the hon. Member for Colchester about the wider EU issue of subsidiarity. In many ways, the nature and structure of sport is a good example of the way in which the concept of subsidiarity should be treated. The European organisations have grown over many years and are tailored to specific sports, some of which are more important in some countries than others, and reflect the nature of sport in specific regions of those countries. Such voluntary organisations are largely democratic and play an important role in those communities. If we interfere with them at international or EU level, we do so at our peril. Co-operation at international and EU level might benefit sports, but we must be careful when we move down that path. The Government were right to rein back the initial proposals in the documents and have achieved a balance that is probably beneficial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The papers demonstrate the importance of sports and the striking statistic is that there are more than 700,000 sports clubs in the EU with 2 million teachers, coaches and volunteers involved daily. European-wide regulations would have to be carefully drafted because they could cause many difficulties, so I welcome the Government's approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On football transfers, it has been clearly demonstrated that special consideration is necessary and I urge the Government to do whatever they can to provide that. If football transfers were subject to ordinary competition or employment law, it could upset the whole structure of the sport. More money is coming into sports generally and the transfer system is one way of encouraging that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I used to play a lot of football but now play more tennis and, through the Lawn Tennis Association, funding is coming down to the grass roots for the extension of facilities. That enables local communities to extend facilities to more people and I am sure that such an approach in as many sports as possible would be beneficial. It would certainly have a beneficial

	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
economic effect for business and local traders who sell sports goods and we would all benefit from the development of voluntary activities, clubs and social life. It is an important aspect of life and I support the Government's approach and the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jack
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fylde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --> </div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to begin with an observation on the documents before the Committee. The documentation from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport is covered by a letter dated 10 January. It was known before Christmas that this debate would take place and I received a letter dated 13 December from the Chief Whip's Office advising that some documents were already available from the Vote Office for hon. Members to study. However, we had to wait until after 10 January to see the full range of papers. This is not the first time that the Committee has had very little opportunity after receiving papers to probe the matters in them. I make a plea through you, Mr. Gale, that Departments make more timely provision of such documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second matter to which the hon. Member for Upminster (Mr. Darvill) referred was the difficulty of seeing through the documents. Our debate would have been better if we could have received with the documents the sort of steering brief that is available to Ministers and which gives a general overview. What we have here are bits and pieces from the Select Committee on European Scrutiny and various European Union documents. We do not know, for example, how many times the various European committees have sat, what they considered and, more importantly in the context of the motion before the Committee, we do not have a clear idea of their future work programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Standing Committee is part of the Community's parliamentary scrutiny process. The motion asks us to "take note" of a series of documents. It states the importance and special nature of sport and refers to the Government's view on doping. Those are not especially controversial comments, but the debate opens a window on the need to improve the way that we scrutinise not only this issue, but other European matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In presenting the views of Parliament and our constituents to the Minister before she has further discussions, this Committee acts as a longstop. I would have welcomed the opportunity to examine the forthcoming attractions column, just as I would have liked an overview and 
	<i>résumé</i> of what has happened, because it would have put the debate in context. Hon. Members have spoken with considerable authority, and useful cameo contributions to the big picture were made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale on football and Opposition Members on television. However, the debate lacks an overview to enable us to improve our scrutiny and to guide Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As you will have gathered, Mr. Gale, I have a special interest in formula one motor racing, which is the pinnacle of motor sport. It is highly competitive, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
sits on top of an enormous amount of activity that percolates down to the humblest man or woman—we must not forget that there are some good lady drivers. I was interested in the commentary on the trickle-down effect of financing to help young people enter what is a highly commercialised and expensive sport. Notwithstanding the Minister's important observations about competition in formula one, which is being investigated, I would have welcomed a commitment from Ministers in the papers to open up to greater transparency who controls motor sport in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a number of occasions, I have picked up the 
	<i>Financial Times</i> to find that Mr. Ecclestone, who has plenty of money to be a political benefactor when it suits him, has bought and sold rights willy-nilly in connection with formula one. I do not know who owns or runs formula one. Ministers meeting on a co-operative basis could do sports fans, in this area at least, a great service by shedding some light on that. I say that because an important theme apparent in contributions to the debate and in the papers is the importance to Europeans of the various sports in which they are interested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our own way, we all support something. Sport generates enormous passion, huge interest and big business. It is important from the individual level to that of commerce and the state. It is too important to fall in the hands of a limited number of people, who for obvious financial reasons take a closed and total grip. As in the case of formula one, where there have been suggestions that its availability to view will be restricted to a closed shop, digital television system owned solely by that sport, there is a risk of denying the people of Europe the enjoyment of something that they are currently able to access at a reasonable cost. I understand that in certain cases people must pay to watch sport, but I am glad that there are still some opportunities to view on terrestrial television, which is as it should be because there should be a proper balance. I shall not trespass further into formula one, but there is a case for greater scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the documents demonstrate an element of co-operation on the problem of doping. If I had one wish on that matter, it would be that Europe should encourage greater consistency in world discussions on dope testing. We have seen British athletes protesting their innocence and their national sporting body declaring them innocent, but it is a matter for concern if some international body then disagrees with what should be a scientific decision. Some of those excellent people devote their lives to sporting activities and inconsistency in dope testing may deprive such talented people of their livelihood. By all means, come down hard on those who cheat, because that is wrong and there is no disagreement about it, but consistency is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to competency, and I am glad that both Front Benches agree that there are concerns about the Commission's competency in this area. The Commission is a centralising organisation and exists by attracting things unto it to control, almost like a black hole. It is unable to stop doing that, so
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0398">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
subsidiarity cannot nourish. The documents reveal attempts by the Commission to justify various activities in the context of health by choosing what it deems to be an appropriate treaty base. This is one area in which there should be co-operation with use of the Council structure, if necessary, but there is no need to extend the Commission's competency to areas other than those such as competition, which is a proper and legitimate area for examination. The same applies to employment, as the discussion on Bosman illustrated, and we must guard against creeping competency by the Commission in what should be matters of democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Access to sport should be available to everyone in the land. Anything we can do to open it up and make it available to everyone is to be applauded. If the co-operative measures in the papers would contribute to that, they would have my support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Kate Hoey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank hon. Members for a good general debate. I have taken on board all their comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the criticism—perhaps that is too strong a word—of the documents, I agree that documents sometimes come from Europe in a form that is not designed for easy reading; they would certainly not win a plain English award. My Department followed the guidance on what to provide to the Committee. At the moment there is no future work programme, but we shall keep the Committee informed of any proposals that emerge during the Swedish presidency—there will be a meeting of sports directors next Friday. I am happy to return to the Committee at any time to discuss sport because I am very keen, as is the hon. Member for Ryedale, that it should be discussed in the House as much as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ryedale referred to the nandrolone report, which should arrive within a week. The United Kingdom's sports review group is following up that report and the Government will produce their response immediately afterwards. The hon. Gentleman will be the first person to see it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the support from both sides of the Committee for what the Government have been doing to support the football authorities in their opposition to the way in which the Commission wants to interfere with the transfer system. We recognise that this issue concerns all hon. Members, particularly those whose constituencies are represented by smaller clubs. We shall continue to work closely with the football authorities and to use political muscle at whatever level is necessary to ensure a satisfactory outcome. I welcome the support of Committee members in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also welcome hon. Members' support for our position on subsidiarity, and for the view that the Commission should become involved only where competency is clearly necessary. There is a general feeling among hon. Members that sport itself, particularly at grass-roots level, knows what is needed. First and foremost, decisions on how to run sport must be taken by the sporting bodies concerned. In answer to the question from the hon. Member for Ryedale,
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
that is why we would not support a Commission levy on sport throughout Europe. The matter is not one for the Commission, which is why we in this country are working with the governing bodies of sport to ensure that more of the money from television reaches the lower levels of sport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ryedale asked about work permits, and I am happy to discuss a review of work permits with the Department for Education and Employment. There are real problems in this regard. In respect of sports in which the top people are predominately from outside this country—I am thinking in particular of ice hockey—we must ensure that our young people have the opportunity to develop and to share in the success. We must get the balance right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet that, in terms of why a particular person was or was not allowed entry, some transfer decisions have given cause for concern. I draw his attention to an appeals committee set up by the DFEE, on which football is represented. In fact, it includes former football managers, which might help in respect of appeals. In only one case has it not approved of a DFEE recommendation. A mechanism exists, therefore, but I would like to consider how to make it better and more transparent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had an interesting contribution from my hon. Friend the Member for Selby—I shall have the pleasure of visiting his constituency fairly soon—who has a good knowledge of broadcasting. The European Union has approved our listed events, and we are committed to maximising the amount of sport on terrestrial television. As the hon. Member for Colchester (Mr. Russell) said, there is no doubt that sport itself benefits from coverage on terrestrial television. With regard to darts, to which reference was made, Sunday's BBC2 coverage of the Embassy world championships drew a huge audience—far more than Sky's coverage of the other world championships. There is no doubt that many people who turn on the television to watch something else start watching darts and become interested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always said that sport itself must take responsibility for looking to the longer term. Sporting bodies must decide to whom they should sell their rights, and they must be aware of the long-term repercussions of selling themselves short. What happened to the Rugby Football Union is a classic example in that regard, and it has learned the lesson. Governments can do only so much. Sporting bodies that are determined to secure a good future for their sport must take into account what happens at the very bottom, as well as the very top. One cannot be divorced from the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to broadcasting, Sports Ministers work closely on such matters within the European structure. I shall take up the point that the right hon. Member for Fylde made about the complicated position of motor racing. That has not yet been discussed, and it would be helpful to know what other countries think about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0399">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
In response to the hon. Member for Colchester, I do not know how many countries recognise darts as a sport, but I shall find out. My personal view is that it is a sport, and the English Sports Council has also recognised it as such. As the hon. Gentleman knows, sports councils, not Governments, recognise sports. I made it clear through my attendance at the world championships that I believe that darts is a sport. It is important that the four home countries' sports councils take the same view about a sport so, although the English Sports Council supports darts, there is work to be done in other parts of the UK. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will continue to contribute to that work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many citizens are not interested in what happens in Europe unless it affects them directly. The way in which sport impinges on people's lives in this country means that it is important that when the European Union gets involved, it helps and works with sport and does not try to take it over. That is the philosophy that the Government will continue to work strongly to support and that I, as Sports Minister, will promote in the various forums in which I take part.
