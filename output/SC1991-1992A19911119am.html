	<section>

	<div class='bill'>Local Government Finance Bill</div> <!-- bill -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I have one or two of the usual announcements to make. There are financial resolutions relating to the Bill and copies are available in the Room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the fact that my colleague, Mr. Leadbitter, will help to chair the Committee. It will be hard work for us all, but I hope that good nature will break through occasionally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will not be our intention normally to accept manuscript or starred amendments, but if amendments are starred in the morning we shall, subject to our judgment, relieve them of that star for the afternoon sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall repeat what I have said about major amendments, or groups of amendments, at the outset of several big Committees in which I and several other members of the Committee have taken part. The purpose of the Committee stage is to discuss the Bill in detail. For that to be done properly, time must be given to allow hon. Members to consider the amendments tabled and to provide those outside the Committee who may be interested in the Bill with an opportunity to study it. Therefore, if major amendments, or major groups of amendments, are tabled, I hope that they will normally appear on the amendment paper. In the past, I have said that that should be done a full week before the amendments are debated. As the Bill is being debated in rather unusual circumstances, I hope that the spirit of that request will be maintained, as it has been in the past by hon. Members. Of course, I do not seek to make a hard and fast rule, but I hope that the Committee will accept the spirit that prompts my remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities (Mr. Michael Portillo)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. In some ways the Committee stage represents a constitutional novelty because it has been guillotined from the outset. Therefore, there is no need for a sittings motion and consequently no opportunity for a Minister to put on record such important matters as welcoming you to the Chair, Sir Michael, and to say how much we look forward to considering the Bill under your guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate you, Sir Michael, on being selected to chair the Committee, because of the constitutional interest that surrounds the Committee stage. I hope that we shall have a good, well-organised and thorough debate and that we shall acquit ourselves with credit in giving the Bill the detailed consideration that it requires. I feel confident that under your guidance, Sir Michael, and that of Mr. Leadbitter we shall do the best possible job in the circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. There appear to be no amendments on the selection list to the clauses relating to Scotland which we are due to debate during the next few days.
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Amendments have been tabled to Scottish clauses, but they have been included with the measures relating to England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is considerable anger in Scotland, particularly among Members of Parliament, about the fact that there is no separate Scottish Bill. The poll tax was introduced in Scotland by a special Bill a year before the Bill for England and Wales. The Bill before us contains a part relating specifically to Scotland but our amendments to the clauses in it will not be taken separately. Furthermore, as the clause stand part debates on the Scottish part of the Bill will be held at the end of our proceedings, it is unlikely that we shall have much time to debate such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether you can separate the Scottish clauses from the other clauses, Sir Michael, so that we can discuss clause 1 followed by clause 70, clause 2 followed by clause 71 and so on. We could then at least have the chance to have proper clause stand part debates on Scotland. If that cannot be done, perhaps we will be allowed to move our amendments to Scottish clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have allowed the hon. Member to make his point because we are discussing serious matters. However, clause stand part debates will be taken separately. It is just a matter of how much self-control the Committee has and the way in which it allows debates to be spaced so that there is adequate time for clause stand part debates. To that extent, I appreciate the hon. Member's point and I shall consider the matter. I make no promises, but there will be separate debates on clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Blonkett 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. I welcome you to the Chair. I wish to draw to your attention the absence from the Committee of the Secretary of State for the Environment—an absence compounded by his inability to be present during the debate on the timetable motion which was passed in the early hours of last Wednesday morning. As a result, we must now discuss the Bill within an unacceptable timetable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, the Secretary of State is not here to answer the questions that will be asked about one of the most major measures that has been introduced in recent years. The Bill is comparable with the poll tax legislation, and it will affect the lives of millions of people and the services that they receive. I should like your guidance, Sir Michael, on whether this action by a Secretary of State is unprecedented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As Chairman, that is not a matter for me. The constitution of the Committee is dealt with by another Committee. I accept that I am also a member of that Committee, but that has nothing to do with the present circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member be brief? Will members of the Committee bear in mind that I detest lengthy points of order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have never heard a lengthy point of order from me yet, Sir Michael. I shall be brief. I refer to the point of order made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) about the Scottish clauses. You called for members of the Committee to have self-control, Sir Michael. However, that request requires
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Conservative Members to use their self-control. It is not good enough that measures relating to Scotland should have to depend on the self-control of Conservative Members who may wish to waste time to prevent us from making fair points about the Bill's effect on Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, that is a matter not for me but for members of the Committee. Let us now proceed with the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->

	<section>

	<div class='title'>COUNCIL TAX IN RESPECT OF DWELLINGS</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 10, at beginning insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'() This section has effect for the purposes of introducing a property poll tax'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 5 in page 1, line 12, leave out 'council' and insert 'property poll'. 
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On behalf of Opposition Members, I welcome you to the Chair, Sir Michael. I endorse the Minister's remarks—we shall certainly need your wise guidance and, if I may say so, good humour. From our joint experience of other Committees, I know that the Minister and I will do well to repose our confidence in you for such qualities, Sir Michael.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure is one of considerable political sensitivity. Undoubtedly, it is the most major piece of legislation that will be discussed during this significant parliamentary Session. We are aware that the Bill is of substantial interest to those outside the House because of its political and electoral significance. We understand also the difficult circumstances in which the Committee has been placed by virtue of the passing of a draconian guillotine motion. 
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) raised with you on a point of order, Sir Michael, the problems with which that measure confronts us in respect of Scottish business. I hope that you will give early consideration to the problem which my hon. Friend rightly raised and about which Opposition Members feel strongly—the need to debate amendments to Scottish clauses which, according to the timetable motion, must be debated at a certain point. I hope that you will consider my request as soon as possible, for the benefit of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to face timetable difficulties, to which you adverted questions well, Sir Michael. Members of the Committee will also have difficulties in preparing amendments and consulting people. We have to face those difficulties, as my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) pointed out, without the assistance and presence of the Secretary of State. That is remarkable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all agree that the Bill is of prime political significance and we all understand that the Secretary of State was the prime mover, behind the saga of the Bill. I would be prepared to lay money on my belief that the Secretary of State invented the term "council tax". The right hon. Gentleman will claim whatever political credit accrues—I suspect that it will be in short supply—for introducing the measure. He moved the Second Reading motion, yet we are left to face the difficulties which he created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
It was remarkable also that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside pointed out, the guillotine motion tabled in the name of the Secretary of State was not moved by him and the debate was not even graced by his presence. As far as I could detect, he did not appear in the Chamber. Even more remarkably, his name was not on the Division list. Because it is hard to believe that he had other engagements between 10.30 p.m. and 1.45 a.m. that night, we can only conclude that he went home to bed. That demonstrates what the Secretary of State thinks of the motion and of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are entitled to ask whether that unhappy sequence of events illustrates a defect in the motion, in the Bill or in the Secretary of State. I conclude that it is likely to be a little of each.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Sir Michael. I shall put the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) out of his evident misery by concluding my remarks on the subject. The sequence of events is wholly regrettable and virtually unprecedented. It shows what the clause and the Bill have in store for us—not a sustained, long-term, well-thought-out programme of legislation and implementation but characteristic, short-term, electoral thinking and a special example of Heseltinian gimmickry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has one achievement to his credit—the description of the various methods of local government taxation with which the Government have flirted. A sustained effort was made, under "earlier management"—to put it delicately—to call the poll tax the community charge. The great achievement of the Secretary of State was to cut through all the cant and hypocrisy and to demystify the subject by calling the tax by the name by which it was known—the poll tax. It was a remarkable moment when the Secretary of State—I hesitate to mention the Minister, as I shall deal with him later—sat under a billboard at a press conference and described the Bill as a measure to get rid of the poll tax. I think that a little cheer for that glimmer of honesty was raised in many parts of the country when people heard that admission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Significantly, on that occasion, the Secretary of State never quite reached the point of describing the poll tax as the Tory tax, although he had memorably so described it earlier, when he was anxious to get rid of it. At least he advanced and called it the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our debate, it will be interesting to watch and even to take the odd little note from time to time as Conservative Members get up and are forced to describe what was done in their name and, in most cases, with their avid support. It will be interesting to see whether every one of them follows the example of the Secretary of State in describing the hated predecessor of the proposed measure as the poll tax. We shall welcome every convert; when each reference is made to the poll tax we shall raise a silent, but real little cheer.

10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall particularly watch out for some of the luminaries of the campaign in support of the poll tax. For example, we shall watch with special interest for the moment that the dread words "poll tax" pass the lips of the hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Janman). There will be a special moment when the Minister of State, the last defender of the poll tax, uses that phrase to describe the measure. He has already sold the pass because, if I recall correctly, he was with the Secretary of State when he consented to sit under the billboard which I mentioned already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As someone once memorably asked, what is in a name? We have the answer in the extreme lengths to which the Conservative party went to try to dissociate itself from the term "poll tax". One cannot blame it for that because the poll tax was redolent with history's judgment of what is regarded universally as a repressive and unacceptable measure. We need look back only to the peasants' revolt of the 14th century and to the perhaps less noticed, but equally unsuccessful, attempt in 1641 to introduce a poll tax. We know now from the most recent attempt to introduce a poll tax—which exists still and which will continue to apply for at least another year or two—that the term "poll tax" is reviled on the lips of virtually everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings us to the council tax, the new poll tax, the new label attached to the Government's latest efforts to disentangle themselves from their difficulties. As I suggested earlier, the term "council tax" seems to have the fingerprints of the Secretary of State on it. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, we can ascribe to him the responsibility for dreaming up that fanciful title. The term is unusual for a tax. It describes not what is being taxed— income tax, property tax or value added tax—but the government agency that is, in principle, levying the tax. That is virtually without precedent, and I should be interested to learn if hon. Members can think of other examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude that the measure is an attempt by the Secretary of State to lay any complaints about the tax at the doors of the authorities that are forced to levy it. That is why it is called the council tax. It is part of that great, sustained, all-embracing and comprehensive effort by the Government throughout their lifetime to denigrate local government. It is designed to put councils in the dock; if people have a complaint about the council tax, they must take it to the council. The Government are trying to say that the tax has nothing to do with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That attempt is part of the Government's long-standing and, I am glad to say, unsuccessful effort regarding the poll tax. In the latter days of the poll tax, when the true magnitude of the disaster became apparent, the Government always tried to say that it was nothing to do with them and that their hands were clean because the poll tax was levied and collected by local authorities. It seems that the same stupid attempt is being made again and, in some senses, with even less justification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It goes without saying that the council tax is a Government creation, otherwise the Committee would not be debating the Bill. There would be no council tax were it not for the feverish imaginations of the Ministers and officials who dreamed it up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
The tax is inaccurately described as a council tax. Even according to its justification, it is not set and determined by local authorities. That is because, amid the structure of local government finance, the council tax—or whatever other form of revenue is raised by local government—is very much a residual factor. It is the one thing that is not, at least in principle, set and decided elsewhere. It is a balancing act. It is the element that responds to the decisions of others. The amount of revenue raised by the council tax is determined by decisions about revenue support grant and the uniform business rate. Even that element is beyond the control of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the powers taken on an earlier occasion and reaffirmed in the Bill, even that residual element, even the figure put to it—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Let me conclude my point because I see that the hon. Member for Battersea is wearing a puzzled expression. He sometimes has difficulty following such points, so it may help him if I conclude and then he can decide whether he has understood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In accordance with the powers confirmed in the Bill to cap all local authorities, the mere threat—let alone exercise—of those powers means that every budget, every residual element, every balancing item and every poll tax or council tax bill will be decided by central Government. That is why I made the point earlier that every council tax bill will have on it the fingerprints of the Secretary of State, either because he has set the budget and applied the cap or because, by threatening to apply the cap, he has compelled the budget to be set in a way that he approves. Either way, every budget and bill will be the Secretary of State's budget and bill. That is why calling this tax the council tax, in a vain attempt to pin the blame on local authorities, is not only vain, but stupid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was right to say that I was puzzled. His argument seemed to be that the quality of services and their cost to the local community had nothing to do with local councils. Was he saying that if there were a Labour Government, he would accept the entire responsibility for the quality and cost of services in the Labour-controlled borough of Lambeth?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That question was rather confused, if I may say so. I shall answer it because it revealed that the hon. Gentleman was confused, We are saying that—indeed, it is one of the major thrusts of our attack on the Government's record on local government affairs—the death knell has been sounded for local government democracy and autonomy. I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on picking up that point so rapidly. He is usually a little slower than that. I am glad that he understands what his Government have done and that he understands the nub of our attack.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that the latter part of the hon. Gentleman's question was somewhat confused. It is precisely to avoid central Government being responsible for all the acts of local government that Labour Members want a system that restores local democracy. That is why we oppose so much of what is being done. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman did not seem to grasp that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talked about giving local councils more discretion over the way in which they raise the money. Am I right to suppose that he was suggesting that revenue support grant should be cut so that local councils have more control over the money that they spend?

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to pursue briefly the process of educating Conservative Members because I can make a couple of points. First, we do not propose to cut revenue support grant, but we do propose to double the tax base under the control of local authorities by restoring to their control the setting of the business rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we intend to make it possible, in accordance with the principles of local democracy, for a local authority to say to its electorate that it proposes to provide services at the following level and to levy local taxes to finance those services. If, annually, the electorate approve of those plans and of the immediate record of that authority, they will reelect the authority, which will pursue that course. That is what local democracy means, and I understand perfectly well why it is a difficult concept for Conservative Members to grasp.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is astonishing that a Minister of the Crown, who is allegedly well prepared, with all the advice and documentation that is available to him, should come to a major Committee of this sort and profess ignorance— perhaps he really is ignorant—of what I should hope was one of his most fundamental pieces of reading. If he has not yet read our "Fair Rates" proposals, I urge him to do so. He will find the answer to his question set out clearly in that document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that we want annual elections but not for full councils, as the Minister will see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was attempting to discuss what the new tax should be called. The Government have decided to call it the council tax. The amendment proposes calling it the property poll tax. Let me explain why we believe that to be an appropriate name for the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
It is appropriate to retain the phrase "poll tax" in the name of the tax because that is what it is. It retains that essential element of the poll tax—the element of a personal or head tax—which will determine, in every household, what size its bill will be. Because of the insistence on retaining that element of head tax, we have the structure of the personal discount system, the need to track people from one address to another, the need to decide who lives in what household, what their status is as individuals and what daily changes take place—all of which means that the local authorities must keep their lists, undertake canvassing or refer to the electoral register. All those problems flow from the Government's insistence on keeping the head tax or poll tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: We support a proper rebate scheme which will be directed at those who need help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman takes me—by a fortuitous accident, I am sure—to my next point, the Government have got into this mess because they insist on retaining a poll tax element and they confuse it with a separate, but more sensible proposition, which is that if there is concern about the ability of some people to pay, such as an old lady living alone, a rebate scheme would be preferable for discounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the whole sorry mess has occurred because the Secretary of State for the Environment wished to return to a straight property tax?

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The Government have created another mess because they, or at least the Secretary of State, do not have the courage of their convictions.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are absolutely right, Sir Michael. The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill, is well taken and I am sure that there will be ample opportunities to explore it later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart reinforced my point. The reason for retaining the poll tax element in the Bill is not the Secretary of State's lingering affection for it but his inability to implement any departure from it without throwing a sop to its more purblind supporters. The poll tax element has been retained to buy off the otherwise implacable hostility of the Thatcherites in the Conservative party. If the amendment were accepted, half the Conservative members of the Committee would be pleased and would wish to demonstrate their allegiance to principles of earlier times, whereas the other half would be horrified at being saddled with evidence that the new tax retains elements of the poll tax. That shows the confusion in the Conservative party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment describes the new tax as a property poll tax. I have explained why we have used the phrase "poll tax". However the tax will be a property tax as well as a poll tax. I look forward to hearing from the hon. Member for Thurrock and from the few Scottish Conservative members of the Committee recantations of their great attacks on the principles of the property tax. They swore that such a tax would be unacceptable, unfair and could not conceivably work. They attacked my right hon. and hon. Friends up and down the country, especially in Scotland, for doing precisely what the Government are doing—supporting the reintroduction of a property tax. All those who excoriated a property tax must eat their words. We shall enjoy watching them make a meal of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the tax is not just any property tax. It is not familiar; it is entirely new. We shall consider some of its deficiencies later. It has one peculiar feature—it is a property tax that is also a poll tax, and it is a poll tax with special significance for the way in which the property tax will be levied. The usual definition of "property" for the purposes of a property tax has been abandoned in the Bill. It is not a tax on property in the sense established by the Geral Rate Act 1967 but a tax on dwellings. The personal relevance of a dwelling house to an individual shows the origins of the measure. Again, the dread influence of the poll tax is apparent. We shall tax not simply property but people in their homes. There will be a head tax on individuals, but part of their liability will be defined by their home. That is why we believe that it is accurate to describe the measure as a property poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
That description is appropriate because of a further characteristic of the Bill. As with the poll tax, the property poll tax attempts to establish something approximating to a flat rate tax. That is why the tax is based not on a proper range of property values but on what Ministers revealingly call a dampened range of property values. The purpose of that, which we shall debate at length, is to achieve the familiar principle of the poll tax: the notion that fairness is unimportant and that the rich should be absolved from paying their fair share. The Minister found the idea difficult to grasp on Second Reading, but every penny that the rich do not pay has to be paid by someone else. That someone else is die rest of us—those on average or lower incomes who live in properties of average or lower value. The property poll tax retains all the unfair characteristics that so marked out the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The label is appropriate. The amendment is not entirely lighthearted. Property poll tax is the right description: it is a poll tax, it is a property tax, and it is a property poll tax because the one influences the other. As I said on Second Reading, the measure is best described as both a roof tax and a head tax. It is a combination that produces the worst of all worlds. It is a tax on the roof over one's head and a tax on every head under one's roof.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not expect that those powerful arguments will prevail over Conservative Members. That would be to expect too much by way of honesty and integrity. Whatever the outcome of the debate on the amendment, and however the tax may be described in the Bill, the Secretary of State was right to stay away to save his reputation. He might have been tempted, as he did once before, to describe a Conservative local government tax as being in danger of being called the Tory tax. Whatever the Bill calls the tax, it will be known as the Tory tax. That would be just.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall now cast aside my dreary civil service brief and turn to the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not think that the hon. Member for Dagenham proved his case. His opening point appeared to be that taxes should not be clearly named for the purpose for which they are intended. It is as though the frankness of calling a council tax—a tax that raises money for local councils—a council tax is an affront to him. I can understand the hon. Gentleman's view—the Labour party's position for the past few years has been that, whatever local authorities do to increase the burden on their residents there should always be some excuse for it. There should be no limit to what authorities spend. There should be no capping. Rather than authorities being held accountable for their actions, there should always be some excuse, some quirk in the way that the grant has been distributed, to explain them—anything to avoid placing responsibility for the level of local authority spending and taxation where it rightly rests, which is on the organisation that set those levels: the local council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise in a spirit of genuine inquiry. I asked earlier whether any hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it no more extraordinary that council tax is called council tax than that national insurance contributions are called national insurance contributions. The name does not describe what those contributions fall on—people's income and employers' pay. The purpose of national insurance contributions is to provide national insurance; the purpose of council tax is to provide council services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leyton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) would probably make the best fist of answering that question, because in the borough that he represents—Wandsworth—the community charge is currently set at zero. Why is it set at zero, whereas in neighbouring authorities run by the Labour party it is set at hundreds of pounds? The reason is that in well-managed boroughs such as Wandsworth and other Conservative-controlled authorities it is possible—capping or no capping—to set very different levels of taxation because they provide levels of service with very different degrees of efficiency and at much different levels of value for money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council tax, which is properly named, has two elements: the property and the personal elements. It starts from the need to raise much less money than the rates used to raise or than was raised by the community charge during its first year. It is organised in bands on property. That is done, first, to make simpler the administration of the tax. The Labour party claims that it aspires to simplicity of administration, but always opposes it in its particular. Secondly, it is organised in bands so that there can be a compression of the tax rates. That is absolutely appropriate. People will have been dismayed to hear Labour spokesmen and Labour Back-Bench Members proclaiming their view that people's incomes are somehow directly related to the price of the house which they inhabit, but that is not so. I shall return to that subject in a moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not recognise it. I am not sure what the hon. Gentleman's argument is. It seems to be almost exactly what I have just said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will read the sentence again because it sounded to me to be exactly what I just said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The document says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No property tax can be directly related to the ability to pay"—</p></blockquote>
We recognise that. It went on to say that, however, there will be a rough correlation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. That is entirely in line with what I have just said. I have just said, and 
	<i>Hansard</i> will bear me out, that it cannot be directly related to people's income. That is why we propose to introduce banding. I do not understand why die Labour party so opposes banding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is apparent to everyone who has just heard that exchange that the Minister was extremely selective in recalling what my hon. Friend read to him. In a spirit of great fairness, my hon. Friend conceded die point, which die Government had made in their White Paper, mat mere is no direct relation in every case to the ability to pay. But according to the Government's 1983 White Paper there would be a rough correlation, and when mat correlation did not apply hardship could be reduced by rebates. That was the Government's position in 1983. Is that still so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government's view is clear. Under the council tax, people in more expensive properties will pay more than those in cheaper properties. But we do not believe that for example, someone, who lives in a £240,000 house in the south-east is ipso facto six times better off than a person who lives in a £40,000 house elsewhere. That would be an absurd proposition, and the only people in modern-day politics who make it are those in the Labour party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We argue that there should be a compression of the bands so that, yes, the person in the £240,000 house should pay more, but not without limit—not as under the rates without limit, not as under Labour's proposals without limit. The ratio between the highest and lowest properties should be 3:1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party puts itself in an absurd position in asserting that someone in a £240,000 house in six times better off than someone in a £40,000 house. Moreover, it entirely ignores all the money spent on local authority services, which comes, in the first place, from central taxes. That has always been an important feature of any system in our country—it is even more so today—and it continues into the council tax. The proportion of local authority spending that is to be raised by the council tax is only IS per cent, in England, and is as low as 11 per cent, in Scotland. All the other money comes from taxes that are relative to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0024">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
people's income or their spending. This money comes from income tax, corporation tax and value added tax, which is paid by those who spend most on goods that attract VAT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party's fear that somewhere someone may lurk in an expensive house who could pay more through local tax—albeit that such people pay much more than they used to in central taxes—drives it to to want to screw every last penny from the local tax system out of people who live in more expensive properties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made an interesting point which goes to the nub of what I said about his difficulty in disengaging from the poll tax. I understood him to say mat 85 per cent, of local government expenditure in England is financed from other forms of taxation, that by and large these are progressive, and that therefore we need not worry about lack of progress with the 15 per cent. Was that not precisely his argument and that of every other Minister who defended the poll tax? They said that we need not worry that the poll tax was unfair, that it was a flat-rate tax that absolved the rich from their true obligations because the remainder of local government finance came through progressive taxation. Is the Minister now making the same defence of this indefensible proposition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It sounds as though the Opposition spokesman, whose party has adopted 70 different policies on local government finance, believes that the most insulting and wounding accusation that he can toss at me is that I have been consistent over the years. I plead guilty, but I understand why, to the Labour party, that seems extremely shocking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin M. Brandon-Bravo (Nottingham, South)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can illustrate briefly the point made by my hon. Friend the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, there is a fairly substantial area of what are now considered up-market and highly valued properties. Thirty-five years ago, however, the area had a pit in the middle, and it was only because of its closure, the clearing of the site and the subsequent building that values have increased substantially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The vast majority of the area's residents lived there 35 years ago and bought their houses—people on modest incomes who would live in modestly-priced homes but who now, because the pit has gone, find themselves sitting on a great asset. However, as for their incomes having gone up, most happen to be pensioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is extraordinary that even the example provided by my hon. Friend from a mining area—an area that should be at the very centre of the Labour party's thinking on these matters—has not influenced the Labour party's demand that the property tax element be directed to the value of a property no matter what the circumstances, and without any dampening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party's argument about discounts is of the same sort. We are discussing local authority services-social services, education and services at district level—and it is difficult to argue to single people living alone that their contribution to local authority services should be similar to that from larger households.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
This was the classic debate about the rates and one of the main flaws of rates. I believe that it caused the Leader of the Opposition to describe rates as the most unfair of all taxes, because single people living alone paid as much as larger households. These are people starting out in life before marrying, widows and older pensioners who have lost their partner. They would be denied discounts by the Labour Party because of the possibility that among them may lurk someone who could contribute as much as a larger household. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) gave a brave example but her argument was flawed. The Labour party says that someone may not need the discount in terms of income and use that as a conclusive argument against giving discounts to single people. I believe that the fairnes of this tax rests upon the ability to require less from single people than from larger households.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should accept that we have made it clear that people will be entitled to relief according to their income and not their status. Therefore, the single person in Westminster who owns, or occupies, a property worth £320,000 or more will, under the Minister's proposals, pay £273 less £70, thereby paying just over £200. Such a person is in a far better position to pay that money than the person on the bottom band who will have to pay £91. Therefore the compression, together with the discount, results in the person living in a house valued at more than £320,000 paying only £2 a week more than a person living in a property valued at substantially less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not only unfair but it will ensure that the person living in the lower value property will pay the discount and the reduction for someone else—probably a millionaire who ought to be serving on this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's use of the word "probably" is a pretty good give away. People who live in more expensive properties are probably millionaires, according to the hon. Gentleman. What sort of world is the hon. Gentleman living in? Will he please go to virtually any constituency in the south-east and meet the people who live in properties worth £200,000 or £300,000? Will he knock at their doors and announce that he believes that they are probably millionaires and find out what sort of raspberry he will receive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make a futher attempt to get our point across to the Government. We are saying that a person being single is irrelevant. What matters is his income. Whether I am desperately poor or fantastically rich should be irrelevant in deciding what I should pay in the sense of giving a discount. No discount should be given because a person is single. We are saying that if a person's income is too low to pay the property tax he should be entitled to a rebate relevant to his income. That could mean that he paid nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to come to that point later. The Government are proposing a rebate scheme. Under the community charge and the rates scheme there was a rebate scheme. The proposed rebate scheme here will be 100 per cent, at income support levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Maryhill is saying that the rebate scheme proposed by the Labour party will be more far-reaching and more generous, I have news for the people she is seeking to help, such as retired couples. It appears from the Bill published by the hon. Member for Brightside that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0025">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
the Labour party will consider all single retired people and all pensioner couples. Therefore, the social security system will intrude on all of their lives because, presumably, the Labour party is talking about a rebate system that goes further up the income scale. The Labour party is talking about pauperising an entire section of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the hon. Member for Brightside, who probably does not appear on doorsteps as often as I, that the proposal for more people to be brought into the social security system would be deeply resented by pensioner couples and those Irving alone. They would say, 'For goodness sake why not have a simple system that limits the contribution that we make to this tax to a fair level by compression of the bands and by giving single people the discount to which they are truly entitled." Most people will say that that is the more simple and fair system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rebates are not part of the social security scheme. We do not intend to pauperise people. Perhaps the Minister would respond to the comment that the Prime Minister made at the beginning of this year that a tax, like the council tax, that involves a rebate or discount for 50 per cent, of the population is a deeply flawed measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We propose discounts for about a third of the population, and they can be extremely simply administered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Minister has ever listened to the argument advanced by his ministerial colleagues at the Department of Social Security and by the Chancellor of the Exchequer about why they did not increase child benefit, year in year out, why they reduced housing benefit and why they have made other changes to the social security system. They argued simply that they wished to target those most in need rather than give a benefit to everyone, whatever their income. That has been their argument for the past 12 years; why are they suddenly changing it now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been no change. We have always pursued a balance. Child benefit is paid to people irrespective of their need simply on the basis that they have children, and other benefits are income related such as family credit. We have always maintained a balance between the two. That is precisely what we are proposing to do here. We are maintaining a balance between discounts that are given on the basis of status and a social security rebate system that is given according to income.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to take the Minister back a little, but he referred, if I heard him correctly, to people living in properties in London and the south-east worth £200,000 and attempted to call in aid their situation to justify the flattening of the bands. The right hon. Member for Brent, North (Sir R. Boyson) is unfortunately not a member of the Committee but he could explain to the Minister that it is exactly that category of person who is gravely disadvantaged by the flattening of the bands at the top of the scale. Does he not understand that his proposal virtually creates the equivalent of a flat-rate tax for people living in such properties?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my right hon. Friend the Member for Brent, North (Sir R. Boyson) were here I would probably tell him that the rates bill in his constituency on a three-bedroomed semi-detached house was typically £1,550 two years ago. The council tax this year on that property for two people would have been £517 and the saving to his constituents would have been £1,033. If that couple had lived in a four-bedroomed detached house, one built in the 1950s perhaps, their rates bill would have been £1,826. Their council tax bill this year would have been £706 and the reduction for them would therefore have been £1,120. I think that my right hon. Friend the Member for Brent, North would agree what a tremendous improvement the council tax is on the old rates bills that his constituents had to pay. In fact, he said on Second Reading that the council tax was a vastly superior tax to the rates or the return to the rates that is being advocated by the Labour party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister recall the celebrated comment that a Tory Back Bench Member made to a constituent who wrote to him to complain about the poll tax: "Well, when your husband dies you'll only have to pay half the bill"? Is that being carried forward here with the personal discount? Will he assure us that Tory Members will not tell constituents, "Well, when your husband dies, you'll be eligible for a personal discount"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the Committee that we are subject to a guillotine. We are going very wide with some of these matters. That is inevitable at a first sitting but I remind hon. Members that many of the matters that have been raised will be discussed in greater detail during consideration of other parts of the Bill and that it is important to restrict ourselves more strictly to the amendment before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The corollary of what the hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) has just said is that the Labour party is telling people that even if there were a bereavement in a family, there should be no discount for the single person left. That would be a shocking revelation to a number of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is it not appropriate to call the council tax a poll tax? It is not appropriate to call it a poll tax because there will be 100 per cent, rebates for people at the income support level. It is not appropriate to call it a poll tax because students will be exempt from paying the council tax. It is not appropriate to call it a poll tax because we are making arrangements with the Ministry of Defence whereby the Ministry will make payments in lieu so that soldiers, sailors and airmen will not have to make individual contributions in the local authority area in which they live. It is not appropriate to call it a poll tax because third and fourth adults in each household will be ignored. It is not appropriate to call it a poll tax because for multiple occupancy households—for example, bedsits— the bill will be sent to the landlord and there will be no individual liability.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to pick up two points made by the Minister and to ask him for clarification. He said, first, that students will not have to pay and, secondly, that in the case of multiple occupancy, the bill will be sent to the owner or landlord. Can the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0026">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
Minister explain what measures the Goverment will take to ensure that the owner will not pass on a proportion of the bill to the students in a multiple occupancy house, in the case of a mixed hereditament between students and those in work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the house in multiple occupation is entirely occupied by students, it will be exempt. If there is a mixture of students and others, either the full council tax will be paid or there will be a discount if there is only one person who is not a student. The arrangements made between landlords and tenants about rent is entirely a matter for them. Students will, of course, be able to arrange to live in property where they will be exempt. If they live in student-only households, the question will not arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellotti</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to clarify the point as it will save time later. When the community charge—I am trying to find favour by using that phrase—was brought in, there were many examples in all our constituencies of landlords who did not reduce their tenants' rent as a result of its introduction. Therefore, landlords and owners have a track record in such circumstances. Have the Government any proposals to save the same thing happening in reverse?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This matter will arise during our subsequent consideration of the Bill. The amendment deals with a narrow definition and the details that the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) has raised will be discussed later. I hope that the Minister will restrain himself and keep to the narrow point of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall restrain myself, Sir Michael.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the community charge was a personal liability paid by all students, the situation will be transparent at the moment of change. The situation is not the same as when we changed from the rates to the community charge because the rates were wrapped up in the rent and therefore it was not clear what had happened in the transition. The situation will be straightforward because students will have been paying their own community charge until the change and the comparison will be a clean one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am amazed at the ineptness of the Labour attack on the tax. After what I have said about how the tax will operate, no one could possibly believe that it will bear any resemblance to the community charge. On the other hand, no one could believe that the tax has any of the features-such as bills without limit and no discount for single people—which brought the rates into disrepute and to which the Labour party wishes to return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Labour party is interested in winning a general election and that there are some marginal seats in the London area. We shall give Labour absolute hell at election time. We shall tell people in every marginal seat in London and the south-east that, whatever, their income, they would have to pay without limit and, even if they were living on their own, would have to contribute as much as larger households if Labour were returned to power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may be interested to hear of my experience yesterday morning at National Power's station in Tilbury. I spent five or 10 minutes talking about these matters with a security guard on the gate, who said, "I have been a Labour man all my life and you are making a big mistake in scrapping the community charge." It
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
turned out that he was better off under the community charge than he had been under the rates and that he would be even better off under the council tax. When I made it clear to him that the Labour party wishes to bring back the rates and return to a system, under which, even before revaluation, he was paying £1,000 a year for himself and his wife—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are now getting into a general debate on the principles of the tax that is set out in the Bill and of previous taxes. This is a narrow, albeit important, amendment and I want hon. Members to return to it, otherwise the Committee will not get through its business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir Michael. The conversation recorded by my hon. Friend will be repeated often in the months ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour attack has been extraordinarily inconsistent. The amendment seems to imply that we are introducing a tax of considerable complexity. By proposing to call it a property poll tax, the Opposition are trying to make people think of registers, despite all our denials that they would be necessary. However, they themselves have come up with four different valuations under the so-called fair rates proposals and a complex system of rebates for groups of people, which would be highly intrusive. They may be arguing in the amendment that we shall track people day by day and discover whether they live alone or with others, but the proposals of the hon. Member for Brightside in his Bill have exactly the same difficulties, such as special arrangements for single retired people who live alone. Does not that take us into the area of having to track people day by day to find out whether they live alone, which the hon. Member for Dagenham accused us of doing?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After 70 different policy proposals from the Labour party, the speech of the hon. Member for Dagenham revealed that only three principles have survived unscathed over the years: people in high-value properties should be stung without mercy and without limit; there should be no discounts for widows or young single people setting out in life; and there should be no transitional relief to help people whose bills are higher under the new tax than under the previous one. I urge the Committee to reject the amendment on the grounds that it is inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council tax is the right name for this tax. It adequately and appropriately describes the tax's function, which is to raise money for local authority services. No amount of huff and puff from the Labour party will disguise the fact that the amounts that people will pay under the council tax will be closely related to the efficiency of their local authority and the value for money that that authority can provide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard from the Minister some evidence of his expected sensitivity to any attempt to describe the proposal according to its proper constituent elements. I cannot profess to be entirely surprised that he resisted the notion that the proposal should be called the property poll tax. Clearly, he does not want to be reminded that that is what his tax is, nor does he want people to be alerted to that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We made some small gains during the debate. It was very instructive to hear the Minister so vehemently describe the short-term electoral considerations which now animate the Government's every action. He seemed not at all concerned
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0027">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
about the administrative efficiency of the new tax or any of the arguments about what it comprised. However, he was most excited at the notion of going out to electioneer on the subject. In particular, he described the efforts that the Government would make in marginal seats in London and the south-east.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What was particularly instructive was the Minister's frank admission, which he virtually gloried in, that when electioneering he would—I should be careful of my terminology here—misrepresent the position that he was attempting to describe. He said that he would tell people living alone that they would receive no help from a Labour Government under our "Fair Rates" proposals. 
	<i>Hansard</i> will confirm that he seriously proposed to perpetrate that mis-statement of our position when trying to gather a few votes in marginal seats. I hope that, on reflection, perhaps after he has read 
	<i>Hansard,</i> the hon. Gentleman will realise that if he encouraged his hon. Friends to behave in that way, that would be shameful and it might get him and his party into considerable trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other small gain was that we did, as I predicted, hear dropping from the Minister's lips the dread phrase "the poll tax". It is true that he subsequently reverted to describing the tax as the community charge, but he at least deigned to discuss whether the council tax should be described as a poll tax. The hon. Gentleman rejected that idea because it is clear that he at last has been converted to the notion that the poll tax is an electoral liability, not to say a disaster. I suspect that that is probably true of all erstwhile diers in the last ditch in support of the poll tax. They too have decided that they must abandon it once and for all. We shall be interested to hear whether the Minister's lead is followed by some of his hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand why the Minister does not want to use the terms poll tax or property poll tax, but he did not explain how he could get away from the fact that this tax is indeed a head tax which not only counts numbers but applies variably according to personal status. That is the essence of a poll tax. We know where the term poll tax comes from and I am sure that the Minister does as well. Poll is an old word for head: die poll tax is a head tax applied to individuals. That is precisely the element that is retained in the Government's proposal, to such a degree that some of the complexities of the poll tax are exacerbated by the new tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Bellotti) tempted the Minister to discuss students. The Minister's response confirmed many of our worst fears. Under the Government's proposals, if two students share a flat, that flat is exempt and they pay nothing, but, bearing in mind the daily basis of liability, if one student gives up his or her course for whatever reason, hey presto, not only does that student become liable, but both students have a changed status and become liable: they no longer live in an exempt property and they have to pay 75 per cent, of the council tax on that property. That is extraordinary. It is a good instance of how the tax applies to individuals, depending on their number and status, rather than to property. This tax is undeniably a poll tax and it should properly be described as such.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may well be so. We shall look forward to hearing the Minister further elaborate points that arise from ex cathedra statements made by Ministers outside the Committee.

If the hon. Gentleman's understanding is right, I counsel him not to be too optimistic on behalf of that single student, because I cannot imagine a bill for 75 per cent. of the council tax arriving and one student saying to his former student colleague, "That's for you, because you're no longer a student. You now have to pay all that bill, even though I share all other expenses."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps we can now return to the amendment. I am afraid that I did not jump in early enough on me original intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: By all means, Sir Michael.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other weakness in the Minister's position was that he seemed unable to understand the concept of a property tax with an effective system of rebates to take account of the means and ability to pay of those liable to that property tax. I suspect that we shall have to face that problem throughout the Committee's proceedings. I know that this is a matter of faith for most Conservative Members: they will persist in misunderstanding the proposal throughout our proceedings, but it is depressing to have that demonstrated so early and to realise that we shall meet a blank wall of incomprehension. We cannot persuade Conservative Members—or so they will pretend—that our proposals are infinitely more sensible and practicable than their own confused system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the Minister understands very well why the council tax is both a property tax and a poll tax. I suspect that he is unwilling to face up to that for obvious reasons, but that is no reason for us not to do our job of bringing home to a wider public that that is what now faces them. Because the Minister did not deal properly with our arguments I shall press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I begin, may I clarify the point of order raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton)? Will he be free to move and discuss amendment No. 13 in the debate on this group of amendments even though it will not be voted on until the guillotine falls tomorrow night?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the exception of amendment No. 13, this group of amendments is designed to probe the Government's concept of the tax. We have already established that the Government have had to swallow their reservations about a property tax. They have had to dress it up with a head tax element. That has proved unnecessary. The political pressures to which the Government thought that they must respond by preserving some element of the poll tax have melted away. As the main supporters of the poll tax departed the scene, all the acolytes packed up their tents and stole away. The political pressure to retain the poll tax no longer exists. But the Government were too craven to test that theory. Consequently, they are lumbered with a property poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To retain the poll tax the Government have confused otherwise straightforward proposals. For example the complex discout system arises because of the retention of the head tax element. The 
	<i>Local Government Chronicle</i> stated in a leading article that the discount system was the source of most of the difficulties and that it would be better if it was abandoned sooner rather than later. The Government's insistence on the discount principle means that we are burdened with all the paraphernalia of tracking people, of changes in status, of many lists, canvasses, and references to electoral registers. The aim is to keep the poll tax alive—I believe that that is now a lost cause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government do not have the courage of their convictions. They did not dare propose a straightforward property tax, accompanied by a proper 100 per cent, rebate system, which should have been applied from the outset. The Government dare not accept the principle of a property tax linked to the ability to pay because the Opposition have supported that for many years. It is the basis of our "Fair Rates" proposal. They know that if they were to adopt that principle, the Opposition would attack them for conceding that they had continually made mistakes during the past five or six years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would flush out one of the small but important complexities of the Bill. The Government's confusion has led to the abandonment of the definition of property used under the rating system. The Bill refers to dwellings instead of property. At first sight, that is an unimportant change. However, it illuminates a shift from a property tax, mitigated by a proper rebate system, to a property poll tax. The continued reference to dwellings rather than property gives the game away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill describes a head tax, for which liability is partly defined and limited by the head's relationship with his or her home. The proposed tax is no longer a tax on hereditaments; it is a tax on people in their homes. I merely point out that that change has occurred. I believe it to be significant because it highlights the Government's difficulties and confusion and their inability to disentangle themselves from the hated poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's predicament reminds me of the tale told by Uncle Remus about the Tar Baby. I read it when I was a child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0029">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a New Zealand story.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is an American story. Brer Fox or Brer Rabbit met the Tar Baby and told it to get out of the way. The Tar Baby was inanimate and therefore did not move. Brer Fox pushed it but discovered that his left hand was stuck to the Tar Baby. He then struggled to get free and put his right hand on the Tar Baby, but that got stuck as well. Then he decided that he would kick the Tar Baby away, but his leg got stuck too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This, it seems to me, is an exact metaphor for what the Government are now doing with the poll tax. They are desperate to get rid of it, and would love to get it out of the way, but each time they try to do so, they find that they get stuck more and more firmly to its principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to the Minister's explanation of why we are no longer talking about property, and why the odd reference to dwellings occurs in the Bill. We shall listen with particular relish to what the Minister has to say because we know of his earlier fervent support for the poll tax. We suspect that, rather than wanting to get rid of the Tar Baby, the Minister is happily engaged in a very close embrace with it. He wants to be stuck to it. How does the shift from property to dwellings explain the Minister's current posture? Are we right in thinking that we have yet more evidence that the poll tax lives on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to confine my remarks to amendment No. 13. It relates to clause 70, and I hope that we shall vote upon the amendment when we consider that clause. The amendment would get rid of the council tax altogether, and replace it with a fair rates tax system which closely resembles the old rating system. The fair rates tax system would be introduced on 1 April 1993, and in the first instance it would be the old rating system, but it would be amended thereafter; that is the only way the system could be introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am having to speak on a Scottish matter in the middle of yet another debate. That in no way implies criticism of you, Sir Michael; the timetable motion has already caused you some difficulties, and it has brought us to this situation. We should have had a separate Scottish Bill, and we should certainly have had separate debates about Scotland in Committee. After all, the whole shambolic, unfair mess of the poll tax was started in Scotland by the Government when they got in a panic. Scotland has suffered the consequences of that idiotic decision longer than the rest of the country, and it has had profound effects on Scottish local government, which now faces a crisis because of the poll tax. We therefore think that such facts should be debated separately in Committee. With the Tory party in total disarray in Scotland at the moment, it might have been good politics, from its point of view, to have shown just a little more humility and diplomacy in the way that it handled Scottish matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before any Conservative Member jumps up and talks about the discredited rating system, he should remember that the poll tax legislation was in place in only one part of the United Kingdom when the general election was fought: in Scotland. We fought that election on the same proposal as the amendment. The result of the election was that the Tory party lost 11 seats in Scotland, we won nine or 10 more seats, and other parties won seats as well, including that of the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has clearly said that if we accept amendment No. 13, we should have one year of the old rating system using old valuations, which would be subject to a revaluation from year two onwards. Council estates in my constituency had rates around the £400 mark two years ago. Under the old rating system, and with current local government spending, council tenants would be paying £612, which would put them, under our proposals, in band F or G. That is monstrous. At the very worst, council houses will be in band B under our proposals. So much for the information, but my constituents do not want it—[

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) rightly using unparliamentary language about that suggestion. First, the hon. Gentleman has ignored the £4.5 billion that the Government have put into local government since that time. Secondly, we shall not be using any form of banding system for taxation in Scotland. Rather, we propose to have individual valuations and rebates in operation there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rating system was not discredited in Scotland as it was in England. The Scottish electorate did not believe that the rating system was at all descredited. In the last general election, the Scottish people voted clearly for the Labour party, which supported the rating system, and against the Tory party, which sought to put the poll tax in its place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, has difficulties both with this amendment and the Bill. He has been one of the most fervent supporters of the poll tax—up to the time when the Government decided that they would propose a different approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the Opposition's view—it will not, of course, be confirmed for some 30 years—that die Secretary of State for Scotland and the Under-Secretary argued strongly in various ministerial contexts to retain the poll tax in whatever form it could be preserved. They lost the battle; they simply won the compromise, which is the mess now facing us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The poll tax was born in panic in Scotland: it is now dying in Committee in equal panic. The former Prime Minister, the right hon. Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher) and the former Secretary of State for Scotland, the right hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) were faced with a Scottish Tory party conference in 1985 which was baying for blood after the shambles that the Government had created through the revaluation. That crashed around their ears and then they panicked. Both said that the rates had to go. Then they considered every other alternative under the sun—for the benefit of the Liberal Democrats, that included a local income tax—but they lacked the courage to say that they were wrong to have ruled out the rating system. Instead they decided to provide a crazy scheme, the product of the hare-brained mind of the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), which led to the poll tax. It is totally wrong to believe that the poll tax was thought through sensibly and logically. It happened as I have described it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I should tell my hon. Friends that I have never been one of those who believed that Scotland was used as a guinea pig for the poll tax. It was the other way round. The people of Scotland should apologise to the people of England because the poll tax was started by Scottish Tories and then imposed on England.

I served on the Committee that scrutinised the poll tax in 1987. There was a timetable motion then. The tax was debated at length. Almost every single prophecy made by the Opposition then has come true. We said that die poll tax would be uncollectable; that many people simply would not pay it; and that it would be an administrative nightmare with which local authorities would be unable to cope. If we made one mistake, it was that we were far to moderate. The situation now is far worse man we predicted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have created bitter hardship for many of the poorest people in Scotland and they have imposed an administrative nightmare on local government officials. There will be massive cuts in services in Scotland this year because of non-collection of poll tax, and that will cause enormous problems for local government officials and the people whom they serve. Despite all that, have we had one word of apology from any Minister for the act of desperation that the Government imposed on the people of Scotland? There has not been even the slightest sign of humility or an admission that they might have been wrong. We have not heard from any Minister the reason for abandoning the poll tax. There has been no explanation, and even now in Scotland Ministers try to blame the chaos of the poll tax on local government or anyone else who might be able to bear a little of the burden. But the blame is entirely the Government's. They should have foreseen all that went wrong, and they are facing further electoral defeat in Scotland as a result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, I do not speak on poll tax from the same standpoint as some of my colleagues. When he tries to place 100 per cent. of the blame on the Government, does he accept that across the country there are significant variations in the ability of councils to collect poll tax? Some councils have collected 95 per cent., so it is a little harsh for him to say that the fault lies only with the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Research shows that in Scotland the collection rate corresponds almost exactly to levels of poverty, unemployment and social distress. Despite the claims of Conservative Members, research shows that in Strathclyde 85 per cent, of those who have not paid the poll tax are receiving rebates and are the poorest in society. They are not deliberate non-payers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may care to remind the hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. During the first 12 months of the poll tax in Scotland, there were more than one million movements on the register, which no local authority could keep track of. As a result they lost track of people and asked for sums such as 30p from people who had died on 2 April instead of dying conveniently on 31 March. The Government created the absurd, chaotic mess and they must bear responsibility for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be proved totally wrong by my constituency, where there is a high level of non-collection. The hon. Member for Eastwood will bear me out when I say that I have consistently attacked those who tried to organise non-payment campaigns. Almost before the English legislation had been enacted, I wrote an article for the 
	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> stating that non-payment was a dangerous diversion from the major arguments on the poll tax. The Tories are still trying to use the hon. Gentleman's argument, but they are wrong to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not a fact that the Government have a novel way of getting rid of non-collection in Tory areas such as Wandsworth? They have paid the tax for them, and local authorities in Scotland, the north-east, the north-west and Wales have had to meet the bill through a huge subsidy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Non-collection is a problem among poor people who have been unable to afford the 20 per cent.—often elderly widows on basic pensions who have made a choice between paying their electricity bills, so keeping their houses warm, and paying the poll tax. Those are the choices that the Government have forced upon the poor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Another problem for local authorities in metropolitan areas such as mine is non-collection of the uniform business rate because of the difficulties that small businesses are experiencing. The proportion of the UBR not being paid in my area is significantly higher than the proportion of poll tax not being paid. This is due entirely to Government policies' effects on local businesses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right again. The Government and die Tory party have got themselves into a mess. Having panicked themselves into the poll tax and then been panicked out of it because they faced electoral defeat, they do not have the courage to say again, "We were wrong. The only way to solve the problem is to return to the rating system, the only system that will operate fairly and squarely as die best form of local tax."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell die Committee what die amount of non-payment of rates was in his area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The non-collection in Strathclyde region, which is all I can comment on, was 0*5 per cent. I have a vision that when we return to a rating system in Scotland, die hon. Member for Stirling will lead die non-payment campaign among Scottish ratepayers, and sheriff officers will arrive to poind his goods at his big house up near Callender. There, standing shoulder to shoulder with him, objecting to die whole issue of warrant sales, will be Tommy Sheridan and die Anti-poll Tax Federation. Perhaps that is slightly unlikely, but one never knows. One of die great beauties of die rates was that they were a difficult tax to avoid so they were paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the collection rate is arrived at over a three-year term, not necessarily in each financial year. But eventually, 99·5 per cent, of Scottish domestic rates were collected. This differs enormously from poll tax collection.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0031">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
Our problem is that instead of reverting to a simple system, we are faced with this hybrid of a tax, cobbled together because Ministers have argued and fought about which tax to introduce. It is not based on principles, logic or criteria for local taxation; it comes simply because some Ministers say that we must keep the poll tax and others say that we must return to a property tax, so we get something that tries to marry the two, which is impossible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Tory party's opposition to the rating system is not all that long standing. I know that they argued in the 1974 manifesto for abolition of the system. But at the 1983 general election, they did not stand on the abolition of rates and, in the period immediately afterwards, having inquired into the rating system and published Green Papers, they published White Papers for Scotland and for England and Wales. The English document, from which I have quoted, states that rates
	<br><blockquote><p>"do have advantages. They are highly perceptible to ratepayers and they promote accountability. They are well understood, cheap to collect and very difficult to evade. They act as an incentive to the most efficient use of property. No property tax can be directly related to the ability to pay".</p></blockquote>
The Government suggested that there would be a rough correlation and stated that rebates reduce hardship. That was their defence of the rating system and the reason why they said at the time that they intended to keep rates as the local government tax for the foreseeable future. I have tried to find a better defence of the rating system than the Government's but I have not managed to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why on earth do not the Government have the courage to return to a system that is fair within rough correlations? I am not arguing that everyone lives in a house corresponding to his means; such difficulties can be taken care of by a proper rebate system. Rates are easy to collect, as most people cannot avoid the fact that they live in houses; whereas under the Bill, the Government must keep track of people's movements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system can be returned to simply and easily in Scotland because our valuation rolls are almost up to date. Yesterday, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) and I met the assessor in Scotland, who assured us that he has the valuation rolls. Since 1989, when he stopped using the rolls, 50,000 new houses have been built in the Strathclyde region and another 30,000 houses have been altered in some way or another. But, given that Strathclyde region has 1 million houses, a large proportion of new valuations would not be necessary. The assessor believes that he can quickly bring his valuation rolls into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assessor told us that, even under the new tax, he will attempt to carry out individual valuations, not by driving down streets and just looking at properties, but by inspecting each house and valuing it properly. He reckons that he will survey one in three houses under the new tax system. It would not take him long to carry out full valuations of all properties in Scotland on that basis. The fair rates system is fair; it is easy to collect, difficult to avoid and it has stood this country in good stead for a long time. There is no reason why we should not return to such a system and to a tax that will return to local government the power to decide a fair amount of its financing without having to worry about administrative costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I was elected to Parliament in 1987, the first Standing Committee of which I was a member considered the Bill that introduced the poll tax to England
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
and Wales. That was an enlightening experience; it rapidly taught me about this place. The right hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) was a member of that Committee. He assured me vigorously time after time that the poll tax was fair and just. He said that the system was wonderful, and that I was doing my constituents a disservice by arguing against it. He argued that they would soon learn what a wonderful system it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invited the right hon. Gentleman to visit Maryhill, and to tell my constituents about the wonders of the poll tax— an invitation he has not taken up. I then spoke at a public meeting in Cirencester, whose residents were horrified to learn that Mr. Vestey, the local butchermeat millionaire, would be paying the same amount of poll tax as the dustman, the milkman and the lady who serves in the bacon shop. If anyone at that meeting had said, "Ah, but Mr. Vestey pays national taxes," I assure the Committee that the audience would not have been amused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government were warned that the poll tax would be difficult and expensive to collect. It was not only Labour Members of the Committee who told them that; people with the appropriate expertise advised them about it, as did local government accountants. Members of the Raring and Valuation Association warned the Government about it. Everyone who knew anything at all about such a system told them what deep waters they would get into. Yet the Government went ahead with the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now here we go again with a tax that is neither fair nor reasonable, and which will take no account of the difficulties about which the Government have been warned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In proposing today our fair system of taxation, I emphasise that one reason why the rates were paid as thoroughly as they were, with very little default, was that people did not resent paying a bill that was fair. People are more likely to pay up when they recognise that a tax is fair. They are more likely to pay if they know that they can afford to. As Jim McFadden, the president of COSLA, pointed out a few days ago, some people may dodge what they know they ought to pay, but buildings do not move. It is distinctly more difficult to evade responsibilities when premises are taxed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1983, the Government admitted that there was a rough correlation between a person's income and the standard of housing that he enjoyed. That is being said by Labour Members today, and if we were to ask people in the street, they would readily agree that, generally, people live in a house that bears a rough correlation to their income. They would wonder why we were even bothering to ask, because it would seem to be common sense. Since there are exceptions, we need a system of rebates, which is the best method that anyone has yet devised to ensure that people pay according to their ability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard earlier about people living in miner's houses, the value of which had increased way beyond what would have been expected when they were built. If the people living in those houses have relatively low incomes, they would obviously be entitled to some degree of rebate depending on their incomes and responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What could be simpler than a fair rates system whereby the council decides what income it needs to draw from its local electorate. If the council is wise and expects to be reelected, it will decide how much is acceptable to that local electorate. It knows the total value of all the rateable
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0032">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
properties in its area, so that it need only do a simple division sum to give the rate poundage on every pound's worth of property. And, because we know that there are exceptions, people whose incomes are such that they cannot afford to pay their full share would simply pay a reduced amount under the rebate scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead of taking the simple path, which everyone understands and realises would ensure that bills were fair, the Government are imposing the property poll tax and the nonsense of a 25 per cent, discount for all single people, regardless of their circumstances. The Minister definitely did claim at an earlier stage this morning that Labour would give no help to single people, no matter how young or old, and regardless of their circumstances. That is an attempt to mislead the public and we are nailing it this morning. Clearly, we must take account of people's circumstances and needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend think it strange that while the social security system deliberately punishes single adults under 25, the Government now claim to be espousing them as a group who need help?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. My hon. Friend has made a valuable point. There are many single people in Britain who have been hounded by the Government. The Government refuse to help single people whose incomes are very low—less than £3.40 an hour, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not being single, but one's financial circumstances that matter. Obviously, there are single people with a very low standard of living: young mothers bringing up children on their own, pensioners who depend on the state pension, or who perhaps have a very tiny work pension in addition, and students. There are also single people who are very well off indeed, who enjoy high salaries and a company car and who have no responsibilities for others. Yet, regardless of those disparities, all of them will receive the 25 per cent, discount. It is obviously nonsensical that, regardless of whether they have champagne or beer incomes, they will all receive 25 per cent, discounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is wrong with the alternative concept—a rebate system which actually looks at a person's real income and responsibilities and decides that in the circumstances he could be entitled to a great deal more than a 25 per cent, discount? A person could be so badly off that he was entitled not to pay any rates at all. On the other hand, some people have incomes that are so high that there is no reason why the rest of us should pay a discount for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Lady say that instead of rebates currently reaching some 25 per cent, of the population she is thinking of 35 per cent, of the population? How far up the scale will she consider going?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman walked into that one. When the Labour party gets into power we will start by restoring employment and getting people back into jobs. People's incomes should be the guiding factor. The Government's proposal is so crude that everyone will recognise that it is extremely unfair and totally irrelevant to their needs. Conservative Members must have some constituents who are extremely badly off. What will they say when they read their local papers and discover how little interest their Members have in the needs of those who are much worse off than themselves?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first thing that strikes me about this group of amendments is that the amendments relating to the English and Welsh clauses propose a system of taxation which, although described as a new scheme of local taxation, is in fact reconstructed rates. Amendment No. 2 refers to a scheme based on
	<br><blockquote><p>"the occupation of property, namely lands, houses, mines and sporting rights."</p></blockquote>
We have got used to some confusion between Opposition Front Bench spokesmen generally and Opposition Front Bench spokesmen on Scotland. The Committee is owed an explanation of the difference between the formulation for England and Wales, which I have just quoted, and the new fair rates tax proposed in the Scottish amendment. If there is a difference, we are entitled to know what it is. If there is not and the policy is the same, why is completely different language used? The Opposition amendments for England and Wales make no mention at all of fair rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This leads me on to die broader question not simply of nomenclature but of what is being proposed. I hope that by the end of the debate we shall be clear about what the Opposition propose—if, by chance, they came to power at the general election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hoped, as this is the first time the Minister has spoken about the council tax, that he would take the opportunity to explain why he has abandoned his support of the poll tax; why he now supports this tax; and whether he will apologise to the people of Scotland for the fact that the poll tax was imposed on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I stress, as this will apply through much of our debates, that we must not return to the basic principle of whether we have one tax or another. That comes in a Second Reading debate. We are discussing specific amendments in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Sir Michael. It is interesting that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) does not want to discuss these amendments. He wants to discuss anything but them. I am discussing the amendments before us and I am asking a perfectly reasonable question about why there is a difference between the amendments applying to England and Wales and the one applying to Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister accept that there is difference between the system of local government taxation in Scotland and England? There always has been a different system and there is also a difference in the way the tax is collected. I cannot understand why the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, who represents the Scottish Office as the Minister responsible for local government finance, does not understand that there is a difference. If the two systems were the same, why have a part in the Bill for England and Wales and another for Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We seem to be making a little progress. The hon. Member for Cahthcart has confirmed that the two Labour systems will be different. The Committee is entitled to know what the differences are. The essence of the council tax is to have the same systems north and south of the border.

We look forward to further elucidation from the hon. Gentleman, but he has confirmed that there will be different systems, under a Labour Government, north and south of the border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can we be clear about the timetable for the implementation of the Opposition's detailed proposals if a Labour Government came to power? We know what would happen in the financial year 1992–93: we all accept that the commmunity charge would continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because if a Labour Government came to power during that financial year they would hardly change the system in the middle of a financial year. People would be horrified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall tell the Minister why the poll tax will have to continue for 12 months more than it should. Last year, when Opposition Members offered the Government the opportunity to get rid of the poll tax by returning to the rating system in 1992, the Government refused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And we were right to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a Labour Government came to power they would continue with the community charge system for 1992–93, but what would happen in 1993–94? I understood the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) to say that a Labour Government would simply reintroduce the old domestic rating system in that year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, if Ministers are in order in pursuing this line of argument, Sir Michael, may I advise them to read what we say? It is clear that from 1 April 1993 we shall introduce our fair rates proposals, which offer the only direct and certain way of achieving a fair system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that the Under-Secretary reveals himself as a member of the group of unreconstructed supporters of the poll tax. I deduced that from his refusal to use that term. Unlike his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment and his hon. Friend the Minister of State he continues to refer to the existing tax as the community charge. Is that the terminology that he insists on using?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can answer that easily. We are in a Standing Committee and I am referring to the term used in the legislation that the Bill will replace. I thought that the term was technically correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are clear that for 1993–94 the Labour party proposes to bring in a new fair rates tax in Scotland, not a tax based on existing valuations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that people understand what the Labour party intends to introduce. Will the Minister confirm that I heard the hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We look forward to the results of the meetings that will doubtless be held after this morning's sitting by the hon. Members for Cathcart and for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) to enable them to sort out their respective positions. If the hon. Member for Dagenham is saying that he can introduce a fair rating system based on four different types of valuation by 1993–94 when
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
valuations in England were not made in 1990–93 he will have problems—[

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take the Minister back to his comment that it was right not to abolish the poll tax in 1992? Will the Minister confirm that he received representations and also had the opportunity to get rid of the poll tax—not only in Scotland but in England and Wales—in 1992? Will he explain why he thought it was right not to do that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Labour party north and south of the border, and in Wales as I remember, refused to consult with the Government on these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to confirm to the hon. Member for Cathcart that there is no way in which we would have returned to the wholly discredited domestic rating system, nor are we proposing to do so. Criticisms of the rating system by Opposition Members are legion. They were quoted by my hon. Friends on Second Reading. The Leader of the Opposition, on 20 May 1980, described the rates as the most unjust of taxes. That was some time ago and it would be useful to know the precise date on which the Leader of the Opposition changed his mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Leader of the Opposition may have said that, but the quote I read out about the Government's defence of the rating system was from three years later—so I do not see where that takes us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course there were advantages to the rating system, notably the ease of payment, but we are discussing Opposition amendments. I am trying to establish what they mean and what the Labour party's policy is. The Opposition has constantly criticised the rating system and, frankly, it was the most unfair of all taxes, as the right hon. Members for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) and for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman) and other hon. Members have confirmed. We shall certainly not go back to the most unfair of all taxes, which was unrelated to the ability to pay, which took no account of the number of people living in a property, and which was based on a little understood valuation system. The Government have no wish to return to that discredited system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dagenham asked me to describe the new tax. It is a combined property and personal tax which contains 50 per cent, of each element. People find a rough and ready justice in that proposal, which has come in for little real opposition. When I was in Kincardine and Deeside no one asked me about our proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The valuation suggested by the Opposition in these amendments is based on an amalgam of four factors, as I understand it. I am open to correction by the hon. Member for Cathcart, who will doubtless put one interpretation on the Labour party's position, or by the hon. Member for Dagenham, who will doubtless give a different interpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The four factors are: capital value, rental value, repair costs, and insurance values. It would help the Committee's deliberations if we were told what the formula would be as between those different valuations, and what emphasis
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0034">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
would be placed on one method as against another. Until we know that, how can we know how the tax would work in practice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dagenham asked me about the basis of the justification for the new tax in relation to my past support for the community charge. I believe that he described me as unreconstructed. Perhaps that is better than being a tourist attraction, to cite another recent description.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ancient monument!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The compliments are pouring in from all sides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council tax remedies all the deficiencies of rates. The valuation is straightforward, on capital values. People understand that; it is easily understood. Everybody understands the basis of capital valuations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This sudden conversion to capital values is astonishing. I recall the time when the Labour party in Scotland proposed the use of capital valuations. A poster appeared all over Scotland; it depicted as vultures, on the roof of a house in Scotland, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), myself and someone else. Does the conversion to capital values represent the vultures coming home to roost?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Plainly, the poster got under the Opposition Member's skin. The hon. Gentleman has still not forgotten it. What really upset the hon. Gentleman was not the posters or what the Conservative party said, but the criticisms that he received from his own colleagues, especially from that great, powerful and influential figure the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway) and others, who pointed out the dangers and difficulties of what was proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government propose not a roof tax but a combined property and personal tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I heard the Minister state with apparent confidence a short while ago—I believe that he was about to repeat it—that the tax is a combined property and personal tax. We have never argued that it was exclusively a roof tax; we have always been happy to concede that it was partly a roof tax and partly a head tax. Can he explain the difference, except in the terms of the dignity of the language, between his assertion that it is a personal tax combined with a property tax and our description of exactly the same phenomenon as a combination of a head tax with a roof tax? What is the difference between a property tax and a roof tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A property tax can be based on a number of factors. As I understand the Labour party's new proposals, they do not constitute a roof tax because they would be based on four different methods of valuation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>rose</i>——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I have given way several times to Opposition Members. I have been very generous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has mentioned a couple of times the rather strange elements within the valuation exercise proposed by the Labour party. Before my hon. Friend moves on from this topic, will he comment
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
on the Labour Party's plans for a revaluation every year? In my view, that offers an encouragement to dereliction, to the non-maintenance of properties. We know that when local authorities offer certain improvements for council properties, provided that people will pay the extra rent, people do not want to pay that extra rent—and they certainly did not want the extra valuations that they had under die old rating system. An annual valuation would encourage the near destruction of properties because people would be discouraged from maintaining and improving them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point about the practical effects of a yearly revaluation process. One of the great advantages of the council tax is that, because of the banding system, it will not require constant revaluation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the point that Opposition Members made about the single adult discount and ability to pay. The discount is not an alternative to the rebate system, which will deal with the ability to pay. The system will go up to a 100 per cent, rebate. The 25 per cent, reduction will ensure that single adults will no longer be penalised. Single adults are bound to use services less than households with two or more adults. It was widely perceived as an injustice under the rating system that single adults paid precisely the same as a household containing two or more adults. That is why we have allowed for that problem with the 25 per cent, single person discount. All my evidence reveals that that proposal is widely appreciated by the people of this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had some, but not much, elucidation of how the amendments would work in practice. We look forward to clarification of the differences between north and south.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council tax is a commonsense tax and a fair tax. I urge the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That was the speech of a man who was not speaking with any conviction. The fact is that the Minister, in his heart of hearts, still wants the poll tax. His whole argument was based on pushing the property tax element of the new tax to one side and making it all about the personal element-in other words, the poll tax element. What I cannot understand, and it is true of all the Scottish Ministers at the moment, is why none of them had any principles when it came to a choice between their stand on the poll tax and their ministerial cars. The ministerial cars won in every case.

The Minister is trying to bribe me by suggesting that he will not give me a lift from the airport again in his ministerial car. By May or June next year, the boot will be on the other foot and I promise him that, whatever stand of principle he takes, if he is at the airport looking lonely and lost, I will give him a lift in my ministerial car.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's speech was clearly that of a man who still believes in the poll tax and I understand why.
