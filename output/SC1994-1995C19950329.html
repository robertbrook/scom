	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. May I profer apologies on behalf of my hon. Friend the Minister of State, who is taking part in a debate on the Floor of the House? He very much regrets not being with us this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will recall that, early in our proceedings, the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North (Mr. O'Brien), raised the recent case of Peter Welch at the European Court of Human Rights. He asked whether that judgment might affect the Bill. My hon. Friend the Minister subsequently indicated that the Government were considering the Welch judgment and might, in due course, seek my agreement to amend the Bill, if it was thought desirable in the light of that judgment. I confirm that the Government have concluded their consideration of that judgment and have sought my agreement to make a small number of amendments to the Bill. I have agreed. I raise the matter now to let hon. Members know that further amendments will be tabled on Report to deal with that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir John. It was not a point of order, but it was very informative. I call the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Exeter (Sir J. Hannam) for his helpful intervention. I apologise on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael), the shadow Minister, who is also engaged in debate on the Floor of the House—the same debate as the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that the Bill will come back to the Floor of the House for consideration on Friday. I should be grateful if the hon. Member for Exeter would confirm that explanatory notes will be provided for all the amendments that he will table then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir John Hannam</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly try to ensure that notes on the amendments reach members of the Committee before we get to that stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we last met, I said that we were somewhat surprised that Opposition Members had not been consulted about new clause 2 and the associated amendments. We were a little puzzled because several of my hon. Friends are sponsors of this important Bill. I asked the Minister to furnish an explanatory note and he sent an extremely
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0382">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
helpful note to all members of the Committee. I understand that the Minister apologised for that oversight, but that he wanted to consult first and provide an explanatory note nearer the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall pose the hon. Member for Exeter a couple of questions. I assume that new clause 2 is the result of representations, perhaps from countries with overseas jurisdictions, which were worried about how legislation was working in relation to the proceeds of crime as a result of terrorist activity, sometimes emanating from their own countries. It would help to know whether my assumption was correct and to know the jurisdictions involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make the assumption because the proposal clearly has the Government's full support. The hon. Member for Exeter is doing the Government a service in tabling the new clause and the amendments. They obviously considered that the hon. Gentleman's Bill was a convenient vehicle by which to implement such measures. It would be interesting to know, therefore, what consultation the Government have had about the matter. I appreciate that the Minister of State is not in Committee to represent the Government, but in his absence, it would be helpful to know more about the background to the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would cover terrorist activity in an overseas jurisdiction and the money, property or instruments that were used in that activity, It would add flexibility to our legislation, so that before waiting for proceedings to take place in that overseas jurisdiction, an application could be made to the High Court to keep such property. I should be grateful for confirmation of that. The fact that an application could be made to the High Court is a safeguard, although proceedings may not have started in the other country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, the Minister said that the provisions will provide more flexible powers for enforcing external forfeiture orders. Clearly, flexibility is important because of modern communications. Unfortunately, terrorist activity can flourish between countries more easily than it did previously. We all have an interest in ensuring that terrorism, wherever it takes place, is dealt with as swiftly and properly as possible. There need to be safeguards within such flexibility, however. I should like more information from the hon. Member for Exeter about the new clause and confirmation that it will operate in the way in which I have outlined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir John Hannam</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has raised some interesting and important matters, which I shall certainly try to deal with in the absence of my Friend the Minister. When the Government were drafting the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989, the problem came to light of the restraints that might apply to the seizure of proceeds from terrorism and of goods and facilities that might be used in terrorism—the seizure would be held up during the necessary proceedings in another country. The difficulty related to the length of time that would be needed to secure the necessary overseas order before proceedings could be started here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
Amendments to prevention of terrorism legislation were necessary to enable domestic restraint orders to be obtained at an early stage, when proceedings were beginning in a jurisdiction abroad. The proposal arose from discussions with and representations from other countries, especially India. While the external restraint order was being secured there, something would have to be done here to enable proceeds from terrorism and items that could be used in terrorism to be seized.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure will add flexibility to the powers in our courts to restrain assets in this country on behalf of other jurisdictions; the powers are not directly for our benefit, but to enable other countries to ensure that action is taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 4 to the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 198 enables enforcement in this country of external orders for the forfeiture of terrorist funds, and the Criminal Justice Act 1990 enables external orders generally to be enforced here. The relationship between the two pieces of legislation is obvious, but it became apparent during work on the terrorism legislation that there was some doubt as to whether the power to restrain assets conferred by section 9 of the 1990 Act was effective. The amendment will rectify that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green said, an application can be made to the High Court before proceedings have begun in overseas jurisdictions, which is important, in that it prevents dissipation of assets. The main problem in all proceeds of crime proceedings is the speed with which one can take action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that an application can be made to the High Court. Does he mean that, if the process is to be used, an application will have to be made to the High Court on every occasion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir John Hannam</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady also mentioned consultations, which were not considered essential, as the Temporary Provisions Act provides that orders must be brought before Parliament, where the matter could be discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have dealt with the points that the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green raised, which were important. I also hope that the Committee accepts that it is desirable that the difficulties that were described in the Minister's letter, which was sent to all hon. Members, should be dealt with expeditiously. It seems right that the opportunity presented by the Bill should be used to remedy the matter and I ask the Committee to accept the new clause and amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

May I say that the Committee's proceedings have lasted far longer than they should have done, not because of interest in this important Bill, but because of other considerations of Conservative Members? Some Conservative Members' contributions have had more to do with delaying other important private Member's Bills than their enthusiasm for this Bill. The Opposition have supported the Bill and the hon. Member for Exeter.
