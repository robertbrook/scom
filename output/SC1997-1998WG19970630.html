	<section>

	<div class='title'></div> <!-- title -->

	<p>11 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the first question, may I thank Flintshire county council for agreeing to host the first meeting of the Welsh Grand Committee to be held in north Wales. I would particularly like to thank the chief executive of the council and his staff, as well as the Welsh office, for the thorough and efficient arrangements they have made for today's sitting. Hon. Members will be aware that the chairman of the council has kindly offered to provide lunch for members of the Committee. I therefore propose to suspend the Committee informally for 45 minutes for that purpose at about 1 o'clock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Committee will bear with me, I shall now make a brief statement about the use of the Welsh language during these proceedings. This is the first meeting of the Welsh Grand Committee at which simultaneous interpretation facilities will be available for the translation into English of speeches made in Welsh, but not from English into Welsh. The arrangements governing the use of Welsh in the Committee were set out in the third report of the Procedure Committee of the Session 1995–96, which was approved by the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful if I remind hon. Members of the main points of the Procedure Committee's report. They were that hon. Members proposing to speak Welsh should give the Chairman notice in English of their intention to do so—at the latest, when they are called to speak or to ask a question—that they should restrict themselves to one language in the course of any one speech, question or intervention and that points of order should be raised in English only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also ask hon. Members not to touch their microphones because they are being operated centrally by 
	<i>Hansard.</i> Do not rest papers on them because that will cut into the system. If hon. Members wish to receive a translation, they should use channel 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now come to questions for oral answer by the Secretary of State for Wales. As the Standing Order allows only 30 minutes for questions, may I appeal to right hon. and hon. Members for brief supplementary questions and for brief replies?

	<div class='title'>Class Sizes</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>1. 
	<div class='member'>Mr Edwards</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what progress he has made towards ensuring class sizes below 30 for five, six and seven-year-olds. [4317]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Peter Hain)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bore da, or good morning, Mr. Jones. May I welcome you to the Chair of this important Committee on this historic occasion? I am sure that you will discharge your duties with your customary elegance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have taken the first step by introducing the Education (Schools) Bill, which will phase out the assisted places scheme and release resources to fund the reduction in class sizes. Consultation will start shortly with Welsh local authorities on the implementation of the policy for class-size reduction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edwards</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that answer. May I assure him that in my constituency in Monmouthshire there is considerable support for the Government's commitment to reduce class sizes to below 30 for all five, six and seven-year-olds? In many of the schools that I have visited in the past few months, there is a high level of expectation that the policy can be implemented in the first term of a Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his question. He can rest assured that we will get class sizes down just as soon as we can. It is vital that standards be driven up. The smaller the classes, the greater the opportunity for all our pupils to enjoy the very best standards and the excellence that schools in Wales have to offer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> (
	<i>Translation</i>): To what extent does the hon. Gentleman accept that the question of class sizes should be considered in the context of the need for a full schools policy for Wales that has been adapted and tailored to the requirements of Wales? To what extent will the White Paper reflect the considerable difference between conditions in Wales and in England and provide an opportunity to put Welsh policies in order? To what extent will the proposed Assembly have powers to enable us to design policies suited to Wales's needs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes two important points. First we need a distinct education policy to meet Welsh needs and circumstances. For that reason the Government have proposed the first ever Welsh education White Paper, which will present relevant policy specifically for Welsh needs. Also, the establishment of a Welsh Assembly will help us to develop an education system that will produce the highest possible standards for Wales. This is why I am wearing my "Yes for Wales" sticker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Welsh Office's decision to abolish the ill-fated nursery voucher scheme has received universal acclaim in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend speaks for everyone in the schools system in Wales—parents, teachers and everyone else. The nursery voucher system was a bureaucratic monstrosity that withdrew money from the activity of providing high standards in the classroom and transformed it into a nightmare of form-filling. We have now abolished that scheme—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1105">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Wales was the first part of Britain to do so—and that has established our determination that a distinctive education policy for Wales, developed by people elected in Wales, should be presented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Women</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>2. 
	<div class='member'>Ms Julie Morgan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what measures he proposes to promote the interests of women in Wales. [4318]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Ron Davies)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I, Mr. Jones, repeat the welcome extended to you earlier by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have announced that a new women's unit has been established to promote women's issues across Government, and I will take responsibility for women's issues in Wales. I have already met the four Welsh Members who are women. I intend to maintain regular contact with voluntary and other groups in Wales that are concerned with women's issues and I wish to see more women appointed to public bodies in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morgan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my right hon. Friend for his answer. As one of only seven women ever elected as a Member of Parliament for a Welsh constituency, I should like him to confirm that the White Paper on the Assembly will cover provisions to encourage full democratic representation from the whole population of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that it would not be proper at this stage to divulge details of the White Paper, but we believe that if the Welsh Assembly is to be successful it must be representative of all shades of opinion, of men and women, and of the different culture and geography in Wales. As a party politician and member of the Labour party I would intend our rules on selection of candidates to ensure proper representation of women. I hope that that objective of mine and of my party is shared by members of other political parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Betty Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> (
	<i>Translation</i>): I welcome my right hon. Friend's reply about the working party involving the four women Members of Parliament from Wales. Will my right hon. Friend comment on the possibility of establishing, with reference to that working party, a clear agenda and a clear path to the Secretary of State's office? Will he comment on the format of the working group with regard to the requirements of women in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did mention meetings with the hon. Lady and her hon. Friends. I intend to continue those meetings with hon. Members who are women. I hope to arrange early meetings with Welsh Office officials, to take the matter forward. I hope that we can have meetings regularly. Their purpose will be to discuss the development of women's perspective across the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reiterate what my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Neath (Mr. Hain), said about being in Mold under your chairmanship, Mr. Jones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank my hon. Friend for his reply, but must point out that it is not adequate. I represent the area covered by Dyfed-Powys health authority. We held a meeting about the problems that the authority faces in the current financial year. None of the trusts has been able to sign a contract for service this year and the chief executive has just declared that, soon, emergency-only treatment will be provided for patients of non-fundholder GPs. Morriston and many other Welsh trusts and health authorities also face problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that the previous Government's legacy is one of inadequate resourcing for the health service; that it is most inadequate this year, and for future years; and that we must find more money for the health service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am well aware of the problems faced by Dyfed-Powys health authority and by one or two trusts in that authority's area. However, I know that both the authority and the trusts are making serious efforts to tackle their financial problems. Last year, not all the available money was spent, mainly because projects did not proceed as quickly as they should have. We will try to ensure that that money is carried over into the current year. We wish to ensure that the financial settlement of the problems of health authorities or trusts is undertaken in the context of a well-managed service. We do not want to find ourselves always having to put money into areas whose problems are not being tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wish also to examine the whole Welsh Office budget to see whether there is room for new priorities. We are greatly concerned about education—which my fellow Under-Secretary mentioned—and about ensuring that the health service runs effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure my hon. Friend that we shall do everything possible to avoid a crisis and ensure that we move forward with a well-provided and well-managed health service for the Welsh people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of my party, I welcome you, Mr. Jones, as Chairman of the Welsh Grand Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will follow up the question from the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr about the Dyfed-Powys health authority, which is also causing great concern in Powys, the most rural county in Wales. We
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1106">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
in Powys believe that there is a strong case for altering the formula by which the health authority is funded, to take account of sparsity of population. I understand that the Welsh Office is now reviewing the position. I sincerely hope that the health authority's threats to our community hospitals will not continue but that the Welsh Office resolves the matter of NHS provision in Wales by reforming the health authority's funding formula.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is my hope that future questions, and answers from Ministers, will now be more brief than they have been so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raised two issues. A review of the funding formula for the NHS in Wales is taking place. I hope that will tackle some of the problems that have been mentioned. Regarding the proposals made by Dyfed-Powys health authority, it withdrew its proposal to close a large number of community hospitals. I understand that it is now undertaking a new review—that the proposals originally envisaged are now dead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ann Clwyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend not agree that we have a responsibility to reduce inequalities in the health service that were ignored by the previous Government and so became wider rather than smaller? Does he agree that people who live in areas such as the Cynon valley have less chance of living longer than those who live in wealthier parts of Wales? We have promised that by the year 2000 the United Kingdom will have reached the World Health Organisation's target of reducing health inequality by 25 per cent. Does my hon. Friend think that we have any chance of reaching that target?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure my hon. Friend that that is one of the fundamental matters that we intend to tackle. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales has already announced a series of targets that we are setting ourselves to help the people in Wales. In the Welsh Office we are looking again at the issue of people's health and the inequalities that exist. In three or four years' time I want to be able to point to the improvements that we have made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Llew Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend comment on the situation in my constituency, which has some of the worst health problems in the United Kingdom, including the highest rates of heart and respiratory disease and cancer? Does he accept that although we need more public expenditure to attack bad health, we also need jobs, decent wages and decent pensions? How do the Government intend to respond to the obvious links between deprivation and bad health?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have already said, we intend to tackle that problem as a matter of priority. We certainly hope that when the Welsh Assembly is created, its directly elected members will focus fully on the budget available in Wales to tackle those problems. By creating a new economic powerhouse, we will provide the jobs that are badly needed in
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
constituencies such as Blaenau Gwent. I can aassure my hon. Friend that that will be one of our priority targets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State for providing the briefing to hon. Members before our meeting. The briefing shows that the European finance priority funding applies only to the route between Euston and Crewe; the route between Crewe and Holyhead is provided for only under the conventional Trans-European Network. As the previous Government refused to upgrade the north Wales line to priority status, will the Secretary of State give a commitment today that, in negotiations with Mr. Kinnock, he or his hon.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that services from south Wales currently go to Crewe, not to north Wales, and that they do not go via Wrexham? One has to change trains.

Is the Minister aware of the great concern in north Wales that inadequate money was available for the North Wales health authority to enable it to keep its commitment to build community hospitals at Porthmadog in my constituency, and indeed in Holywell? Is the Minister also aware that the cancer provision in Bangor was threatened, although it may now be safe? Is he aware that, as other hon. Members have said, this is part of a problem throughout Wales?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough to shift financial resources in the coming financial year from one pocket to another in Wales. Additional financial resources are needed for north Wales and for the whole of Wales if we are to have the services we need and if those who need to be in hospital this winter are not to be denied hospital beds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

We shall want to review the North Wales health authority's provision across north Wales to ensure that it makes sense.

Not everybody in Wales needs a heart transplant—I am thinking particularly of Scott Gibbs and Neil Jenkins, who have plenty of heart already. But those who need heart transplants and who may not be able to go to Harefield should have the right to have the operation in Wales. Does my hon.

The Minister no doubt noticed at the entrance to the building several members of the public who seemed to be suffering from severe toothache; I do not know whether it was caused by root damage or something else. On a serious note, there is a great problem in Wales: not enough NHS dentistry is available and, in rural areas, the problem is acute—even the previous Government acknowledge that in the last 18 months to two years.

There is an unprecedented level of grant of up to £50,000; some £2.3 million of the money has already been used; there are 49 new dentists in post and there are offers for more.

I intend to make my speeches as brief as possible, Mr. Jones. However, as this morning's debate is slightly unusual in that we are dealing with the Government's whole programme, my remarks may take more time than they would usually take. I shall, none the less, attempt to be as brief as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I start by repeating the thanks given at the start of our proceedings to the chairman and chief executive and, indeed, the whole of Flintshire county council for facilitating our visit here. It is very much appreciated and it is appropriate to put that on the record. I shall be writing to the chairman and chief executive of Flintshire county council to thank them personally for their assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The meeting this morning is historic in many ways, not least because we have a new Chairman in you, Mr. Jones, and I congratulate you on your appointment. The way in which you have conducted the Committee so far has put us very much at ease and there is a spirit of tolerance and good humour, much of which we owe to you. We have made an excellent start to our proceedings and our congratulations go to you, Mr. Jones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be appropriate to place on record again the Committee's thanks to your predecessor, Mr. Roy Hughes, the former Member of Parliament for Newport, East, who was a distinguished Chairman of the Welsh Grand Committee for many years. I am sure that it would be appreciated if the Committee were to write to him to give him our views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Committee is historic because it is our first meeting in north Wales. It is only the third occasion that the Welsh Grand Committee has sat in Wales and I know that my colleages from north Wales were always anxious for sittings to be held here. I am delighted to say that it is part of the inclusive approach of the new Government who want to ensure that government is brought to all parts of Wales. It is, therefore, appropriate to have an early meeting of the Welsh Grand Committee in north Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is historic because we have new procedures. I have introduced a system of issuing briefings to members of the Welsh Grand Committee, which I hope they have found helpful. I shall be willing to receive any suggestions on improvements to try to ensure that any future briefings are as comprehensive as possible to make for reasonable, rational and informed debates in the Committee. This will be the first time that Welsh has been spoken in our proceedings. There may be teething problems, but I shall listen to representations from colleagues on ways of changing our standing orders to facilitate the use of the Welsh language in our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the debate this morning is to explore Government policy; the briefing sets the background. I am not inviting colleagues to jump up now with a shopping list of changes. I take my hon. Friend's point, which he has already raised with me. If colleagues make representations to me, I shall try to incorporate them in the briefing notes that are sent out.

Our Committee is historic for yet another reason. It is the first time for the best part of a century that there have been no Conservative members of the Welsh Grand Committee. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I have one or two comments to make about that, by my hon. Friend obviously wants to say something, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter of some regret that on the other side of the world, an elected body—Committee—is being replaced in Hong Kong by an unelected, appointed quango. It is a matter of celebration that here in Wales every member of the Committee can speak with the authority of being democratically elected. Part of our attack is to get rid of the quangostan—the unelected bodies—of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, that is one of the points that I was going to raise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to talk about the non-Conservative representation in the Committee because it is worth reminding observers of our proceedings that there is only one way in which someone can qualify to sit in a Welsh Grand Committee as of right: to be elected by the people of Wales. This Committee consists of 40 Members of Parliament, all of whom are elected directly by the people of Wales. There is no automatic right or any other way of being elected to the Committee. In previous years, it has been the practice for the Government of the day—largely to facilitate the questioning of Ministers—to appoint additional members of the Committee. That has usually happened when Secretaries of State, Ministers of State, Whips or Parliamentary Private Secretaries have represented English constituencies. It has been the practice to include additional members, but let me make it absolutely clear: the purpose of doing so was to facilitate the questioning of the Government of the day by the Committee, not to confer any right of permanent political representation on people who have failed to win seats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can improve our proceedings by approaching the matter in a more constructive and consensual way. It does present a difficulty that the Committee does not contain a representative of the official Opposition. When we have an official Opposition in Parliament, it is right that someone should be present to put the Opposition's view. I know that there is argument about the numbers and the nature of such representation, but, in a spirit of co-operation, I wrote to the Leader of the Opposition, who was then shadow Secretary of State for Wales, to invite his views on how best we could incorporate Conservative representation in this Committee. I wrote to him about a month ago to make him that offer; I regret that he has not seen fit to reply. If there is any suggestion that a Conservative
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Member of Parliament who is not present should be, only one person is responsible for that: the Leader of the Opposition, who has not taken up my offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman's decision not to appoint a shadow Secretary of State for Wales is a deliberate signal that the Conservative party wants to turn its back on us. If that is the case, so be it; that will not deflect me from my intention to ensure that this Committee acts as a proper, enlightened, rational forum for discussing matters affecting the Welsh nation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Looking ahead to the next few sittings of the Welsh Grand Committee, if the Conservative party were to approach the Government through the usual channels to propose that the right hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram), who is the member of the shadow Cabinet with overall responsibility for constitutional affairs, although not a shadow Secretary of State for Wales, should attend the Committee—in other words, if we were offered the pianist, not the page turner, who is outside today gnashing his teeth because he cannot get in—would the Government find that acceptable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman to whom my hon.

However, if he is appointed as the official Conservative party spokesman, and if I receive a representation from the Conservative party that it wants him to attend, I shall consider it. I do not want to make any further comment on that matter, other than to say that the offer has been made, and it is now for the Conservative party to respond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I will give way to my hon. Friend, but I want to leave this point and move on to other matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Lady makes her intervention, may I ask members of the Committee to make their interventions very brief—so far they have been very long?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ann Clwyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for giving way. May I express the sense of frustration felt by Welsh Members of the House of Commons during the past 18 years that time after time, hon. Members representing Welsh constituencies were unable to question Ministers because Tory Members of Parliament were constantly used to block Welsh Question Time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As one who suffered many times at the hands of that system, I well understand my hon. Friend's point. I also felt that the way in which the previous Government blocked the holding of Welsh Grand Committees—preventing meetings such as this from taking place—was a poor reflection on their commitment to democracy here in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1111">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
I want to move on, and to turn to my two objectives for our meetings, which I am sure that you, Mr. Jones, will help us to achieve. First, I want to ensure that we take every opportunity to remove confrontation from our meetings. Obviously, there will be matters of political difference between us, but I hope that those political differences can be explored in a rational, calm and logical way, not on the basis of confrontation for confrontation's sake. I will do all that I can to use our proceedings to assist in that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I want to use the Welsh Grand Committee to develop a new, meaningful and democratic relationship with the people, and I therefore hope that we will take every opportunity presented by our sittings to take Government back to the people. Of course, that will be a precursor to the day when we have our own proper democratic Government in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it would be appropriate briefly to explain the rationale of the distribution of responsibilities that I have made within my Department. As Secretary of State, I thought it appropriate to take responsibility for the overall strategic direction of the Welsh Office on all matters relating to finance—because the allocation of financial resources must follow the established priorities—and for constitutional matters—because we have a heavy programme of work preparing the White Paper and the legislation that will help to obtain our objective: a better governed Wales. I have also taken responsibility for those matters which reflect the external image of Wales. Those issues include equal representation, cleaning up the quango system to ensure that appointments are made on a proper basis, heritage, the Welsh language and matters related to the European summit and the World cup—not least because that assures me a seat at the final. Those are my responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to take advantage of the opportunity presented by the fact that seven or eight Departments are represented within the Welsh Office—for example, those dealing with environment, the economic development portfolio, health and education. Within the Welsh Office, there is an opportunity to produce a better, more integrated and holistic approach to the delivery of public services. Instead of following the old pattern of having a Minister for this and a Minister for that, without a proper relationship between those responsibilities, I have asked my hon. Friends the Under-Secretaries to take responsibility for two projects, rather than for particular divisions within the Welsh Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, I want there to be better integration between education and training and the promotion of economic development. I am sure that most members of the Committee will understand the rationale for that. Therefore, I have asked my hon. Friend the Member for Neath to take responsibility for promoting economic prosperity. All matters directly related to that, such as transport, infrastructure, investment, relations with Europe, economic
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
development plans, education and training, have been brought together into one portfolio, for which my hon. Friend has responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have asked my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend to balance those responsibilities by looking at the quality of life. I have asked him to take responsibility for matters relating to local government, which are important for the environment, housing, community development and, especially, health. He is considering how best to pull together the Welsh Office divisions dealing with those matters to produce a long-term strategic view of how the quality of life in Wales can be improved. Those two appointments have been made—one to promote economic prosperity, the other to promote the quality of life. I am indebted to both my colleagues for the enormous volume of work that they have done in the first couple of months in Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now deal with the question that is exercising one or two of my colleagues: devolution and the constitutional change that we are promoting. Under our proposals, the functions that the Welsh Office discharges will come under local, directly democratic control. The Assembly will be responsible for almost all aspects of public life for which the Welsh Office is currently responsible: health, education, housing, sport, the arts, culture, heritage and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Assembly will have a duty to work in partnership with the local authorities of Wales. For example, I am anxious that a proper relationship should develop between the Welsh Office and local authorities, so that the interrelationship between local authorities' social services departments and the provision of housing is properly integrated, with the work being done by health authorities. Hitherto, there has been a division because one group of people has responsibility for health, another has responsibility for housing and yet another has responsibility for social services; I want to pull them together. Under our proposals, all those matters will be the responsibility of the Assembly so that it can determine how best to develop a more coherent approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the concern expressed by some local councillors in Wales, will the Secretary of State give an assurance that there will be no centralisation of local government functions to the Assembly? On the contrary, we are talking about the decentralisation of power from London—from the Welsh Office and the quangos.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am happy to give that assurance. We shall obviously explore the matter further once the White Paper is published, but a statutory duty will be placed on the Assembly to further the interests of independent local government. Furthermore—the hon. Gentleman may not particularly want to hear this—local government is a creature of statute and of primary legislation; it is established by Acts of Parliament. The Welsh Assembly will not have the power independently to vary that relationship, so it will not be able to do what the hon. Gentleman suggests. I therefore hope that he welcomes my answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1112">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
The Assembly will be able to articulate the needs, hopes and aspirations of the people of Wales. It will provide a single and positive voice in fashioning the quality of life that the people of Wales deserve. For the first time, Wales will have a clear, authoritative voice, which can come only from a democratic and directly elected all-Wales Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Assembly will be truly representative of the diversity of Wales—rural and urban areas, the public and private sectors, employers and workers, north and south, the successful and the not successful and, of course, both cultures. It will serve all the people of Wales, and its membership must reflect that fact. Its internal procedures should also encourage a consensual, inclusive approach rather than fostering confrontation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be for the Assembly to ensure that the encouraging economic developments in south-east and north-east Wales extend to the rest of the country. Although we in the Welsh Office will be actively promoting wider economic development, it will be for the Assembly to determine the balance between supporting inward investment and improving the competitiveness of our indigenous companies, especially the small and medium-sized firms upon which our economic future will depend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Assembly will also have to take up the challenge of improving standards in our schools, dealing with skills needs and ensuring the provision of places for high-quality education and training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Assembly must, of course, be empowered to do the job. It will have the power to restructure the quangos of Wales and to make appointments to their boards. It will also have responsibility for setting their strategic direction and their operational priorities. It will also monitor their performance and, when necessary, hold them to account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Assembly will work in partnership, particularly with the business sector, and there will be no disruption of the internal market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the Government's detailed proposals will be published in a White Paper next month. That will give us plenty of time to hold a full debate before the referendum. I look forward to that debate. I am confident that our proposals will reflect the aspirations of the people of Wales. What brought this Government to power and what will drive our policies forward is our vision of a better future, with a new style of government—government for the 21st century, not the 19th. It is a vision of government as it should be—in tune with and responsive to the needs of the people of Wales, and accountable for its actions. It is a vision in which our common role is to make Wales a better place in which to live. The establishing of a Welsh Assembly will begin to turn that vision into a reality, which will remain the absolute and highest priority of the present Welsh Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
Since almost the first day we were appointed, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales and I have put a great deal of effort into putting across the message that the Government have made a fresh start in their dealings with local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend used to say that all the functions exercised by the Welsh Office should be transferred to the Welsh Assembly. Will that still be so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a detailed and technical matter, which will be dealt with in the White Paper. However, for technical reasons, a very small number of my present responsibilities cannot be transferred to the Assembly. In answer to my hon. Friend, the overwhelming majority of them will be transferred, but not all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was talking about the relationship of the Assembly with local government. It is proper for me now to say that we want strong and respected local councils, democratically elected by local people, delivering the high-quality services that people want and expect. Marginalising local government, which occurred under the previous Administration, is not the way to achieve that. Our relationship with local councils will be very different. I am delighted to say that the response thus far from local government could not have been more positive. I have met the full coordinating committee of the Welsh Local Government Association and agreed with them a framework that will form the basis of the new relationship. I shall meet all local authority leaders twice a year and the ministerial team will have further meetings to discuss aspects of policy covered by their portfolios. My officials will continue to meet their counterparts from the WLGA to discuss more detailed issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am under no illusion—and neither, I am sure, is local government—that we shall always see eye to eye on everything; it would be an exception in Welsh political life were that to happen. However, where there are differences of opinion, we shall discuss them constructively, with each side understanding, if not accepting, the other's point of view. We share common objectives for the people of Wales and I hope that any disagreements are therefore likely to be about means, not ends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our manifesto we promised to introduce a comprehensive system to improve the quality and efficiency of local services in Wales, based on the idea of best value. That cannot be achieved overnight; we have to deal with a long-standing legacy. However, a good start has been made on that objective and in the new spirit of co-operation to which I am committed, we shall be working closely with local government to achieve it. As a first step, we propose to extend the moratorium on compulsory competitive tendering. I have created the management space within local authorities for them to think more broadly about the way in which they can improve and reduce the cost of delivering services, in line with best value principles. That early announcement was welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1113">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
However, I have emphasised that it makes sense for councils to complete the tendering process if it has reached a relatively advanced stage. More generally, I have made it clear that councils should acknowledge the potential benefits of competition, particularly the value of voluntary tendering. There cannot be a return to the old days when councils sought to protect even inefficient and ineffective in-house teams from fair competition. Councils must be flexible in their provision of high-quality and efficient services; that responsibility applies to the Welsh Office as it does to local government. Councils should not turn their backs on services provided by the voluntary or private sectors that offer better value for money without thinking about the opportunities that they present. However, in-house teams should be given every opportunity to compete on even terms—something which, during much of the past 18 years, they have unfortunately not been allowed to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had some discussion about education and I wish to make clear our belief that better education can help to transform society in Wales. It is central to our vision of a world-beating, job-creating economy and a better quality of life for everyone. That is why education is the Government's principal priority; it is of the greatest importance to all of us. We want to raise standards for all pupils at all schools in Wales and give them the best possible start in life. That means paying attention not only to the fundamentals of literacy and numeracy but also to the development of the whole child. We must provide our young people with the skills they need to obtain jobs and to be successful in work. We must also ensure that they become well rounded adults who are able to achieve personal fulfilment and contribute to society throughout their lives. We want to go forward in the closest possible partnership with teachers; their professionalism and commitment deserve far greater recognition than they have had of late.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our manifesto commitment to raising educational standards was overwhelmingly endorsed by the people of Wales. We shall take that commitment forward in the education White Paper which we shall publish next month; that will be the first White Paper concerned solely with education in Wales. That fact says much about the position of education at the heart of the Government's agenda and about the objective of the new regime in the Welsh Office to develop educational policies in Wales that are tailored to Welsh needs and aspirations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that education should be a priority and I am sure that it will be, but I am concerned that no reference was made in the background briefing paper nor by the right hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even before the publication of the White Paper on education we have acted to honour our pledge to abandon the nursery voucher scheme, which was and is irrelevant to the needs of parents. Vouchers were not intended to create a wholly unnecessary bureaucracy for schools, local authorities and other providers. Nursery vouchers for state schools will end from September.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may well be. I happen to believe, however, that, if one gives an election manifesto commitment, one has an obligation to deliver on it—whether or not policies are popular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Conwy (Mrs. Williams) has made. I am discussing ways in which we may resolve at least some of that problem's more difficult elements. I hope that, in the next couple of weeks, my hon. Friend the Member for Conwy will understand why, at this stage, I am reluctant to go into too much detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further education provision in Wales has expanded greatly in recent years and the number of students has grown substantially. There are over 190,000 student enrolments, with more planned. It is essential that our further education institutions continue to demonstrate their flexibility and adaptability in responding to the needs of students and employers. I am concerned, however, about the plethora of provision that we currently have, as between local authorities and between schools, sixth-form colleges, training enterprise councils and technical colleges. My hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain) is well advanced in delivering our election commitment to create an education and training action group that will pool together those providers to ensure proper planning and the effective use of resources. If the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) has any representations to make, I invite him to make them to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1114">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

my hon. Friend, who will thank me for making that offer on his behalf. If he makes those representations, I will ensure their proper consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Welsh gross domestic product is still only 83 per cent. of the UK average. That is one of the most appalling difficulties that we face in the Welsh Office. We have to ensure that prosperity is spread more equitably throughout Wales and that we improve the overall performance of the Welsh economy. To achieve that success, we need a more coherent approach to economic development—an approach that not only recognises the continuing importance of inward investment but that pays due heed to growing indigenous Welsh business, and to the links between education and economic development and between social and economic regeneration in the local community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh Office will shortly be issuing an economic strategy document, which will summarise the key economic issues that face Wales and suggest proposals for the way forward. In the light of responses to that consultation, I intend to publish at the turn of the year a document setting out our vision of how we can create a prosperous, world-class economy in Wales. That will provide the Assembly with a target to meet.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have made their priorities clear on the national health service, which we want to return to its roots. It must be a service of quality, available to all on the basis of need, not geography, ability to pay or the status of general practitioners. Units must not be managed in isolation from their partners. The principles that underlie our priorities are absolutely clear—public service, local accountability, openness, partnership and equity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The challenge in Wales is abundantly clear and transparently important. Life expectancy is lower for the people of Wales than in England and the effects of long-term limiting illness more than 30 per cent. higher. For the major causes of death—cancer, heart disease and stroke—we also fare badly by comparison with England. Welsh NHS costs are consequently higher. It is important that we tackle these inequalities at their roots—among individuals in our families and local communities and through associated mechanisms such as education and housing.

Providing efficient and effective health services and dealing with illness are important elements at the heart of our policies. But improving the health of the population over time also lies at the heart of the Government's approach. That cannot be achieved overnight or by the national health service alone. It requires the commitment and co-operation of all agencies including local government, voluntary and charitable organisations, professional and academic bodies, the private sector and individuals themselves. I cannot stress too highly my belief that individuals have to shoulder a crucial responsibility.

	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
Not enough has been invested over the past decade in our health service or other public services. Too many schools and hospitals need improvement, renewal or replacement. The Labour party has long pioneered the concept of public-private partnership and it is right that we should use private capital, where we can, to fund investment that might otherwise have to wait for many years. But it is also important for public services to be run as public services. We should not allow the provision of clinical services or education, for example, to become the instruments of private profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee will know that we have been considering how the PFI operates in the public sector. The outcome of the Bates review was announced on 23 June. My colleagues in the Department of Health and in the Scottish Office have already made announcements about establishing priorities in relation to the projects with private sector partners that are already well down the track. In Wales, we have examined such projects closely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By far the most advanced project is the new hospital at Chepstow, in which my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards) had a close interest. The project has the full support of local GPs, the health authority and the Glan Hafren NHS trust. I am keen that it should go ahead as quickly as possible and I expect it to do so as soon as the relevant private finance Bill is enacted. Likewise, the proposal to build a new day surgery and endoscopy unit at Nevill Hall NHS trust is at a similar stage in the process and should go ahead when the Bill is enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trusts have already engaged the private sector in three other significant schemes and proposals have been developed. They are at Velindre, where there is an urgent need to replace worn out radiotherapy machines; at Baglan where the Glan-y-Mor trust has recently selected three consortiums to prepare detailed proposals for that badly needed hospital; and, finally, at Bronllys and Newtown in Powys, where estate rationalisation will go some way towards helping with the financial problems in the Dyfed-Powys area health authority. I have decided that all of those schemes should proceed as quickly as possible and as planned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to other schemes that are in the pipeline, I have asked officials to review the way that we manage capital investment in the NHS in Wales so as to identify which projects should be given priority, and we hope to make an announcement about that before the summer recess.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to PFI projects in the transport sector, I have decided—as the hon. Member for Ynys Môn knows—that the A55 across Anglesey should go ahead as quickly as possible because of its strategic importance, subject to the successful completion of the statutory procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the Bute avenue project in Cardiff to proceed in readiness for the Rugby world cup in 1999. I have asked the Cardiff Bay development corporation to continue with its PFI approach to the project and to consider whether a wider PFI might include the management of the barrage—when it is completed—the bay and other services following the wind up. That
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
is a complex project which is very important for the regeneration of south Cardiff and I hope that a valuable PFI deal will be negotiated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is considerable potential for using the PFI in local government. I am therefore pleased to announce funding for six new local authority pathfinder projects. PFI is at an early stage of development in the local authority sector, and the use of professional advice will develop those projects to the benefit of the whole sector. Three different school schemes will receive assistance—a new secondary school at Aberystwyth; a primary school and nursery unit at Blaenau Gwent; and a primary school and office development at Pembroke dock. The remaining schemes involve the provision of waste recovery disposal services at Wrexham, council office accommodation at Ruthin and a distributor road around the south of Newport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted to say that in addition to those pathfinder projects Caerphilly borough council has also decided to go ahead with a PFI solution to replace the premises of ysgol gyfinn Cwm Rhymni. That was the priority of my predecessor—and who am I to overturn his priorities? The scheme will include the addition of more than 300 additional places to meet parental demand for Welsh education. Part of the funding will be provided by the £5 million from the Welsh Office which was offered to the authority some time ago under the previous Administration's popular schools initiative. That initiative has now run its course. I am sure that those projects will provide valuable lessons for all Welsh local authorities and that they will enable those authorities to provide value for money and high-quality services. I shall issue further details today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that Members of the Committee will welcome the projects. If we are to succeed in the long term we must secure investment in public services and in the manufacturing and service sectors. We have ambitious plans to move people from the dependency culture, which has been generated by welfare, to the confidence-building opportunities of work. Raising the level of skills at home will be crucial and we shall continue to press the case for wide choice as hard as we can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have identified a number of potential inward investment projects and no effort will be spared in trying to bring them to Wales. I want Wales to be confident and outward looking and we shall do all we can to maximise the benefits of membership of the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Wales have placed great trust in the new Government and we shall not fail our responsibilities. We shall create a democratic Wales in which the chance of work and the right to decent health care and education will be our highest priorities. Those were our election promises and we shall honour them. I hope that we can do so in a way that is open and democratic and that by substituting rational debate for ritual abuse perhaps we can restore some confidence in the system of government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member --> (
	<i>Translation</i>)
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate you, Mr. Jones, on being selected as Chairman of the Welsh Grand Committee, which is particularly appropriate as we are meeting in Flintshire today and I thank the county council for its welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also congratulate the Secretary of State on the sweeping victory of the Labour party in Wales and on his appointment—he is the first Secretary of State in 10 years to represent a Welsh seat—and that of other Ministers of the Welsh Office. I wish them every success in their endeavours. We listened with great interest to the Secretary of State's comments and I hope that many of his objectives will be fulfilled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Grand Committee is historic for a number of reasons. It is historic because it is the first time that the Committee has met in Wales outside Cardiff. That is an important development and is a sign in the Welsh context that all parts of Wales are important. May we in this new period turn our backs on the continual arguing—I was pleased to hear the words of the Secretary of State—and bickering with south against north, Welsh-speaking against non-Welsh-speaking, rural against industrial, which has done so much damage to Wales? All of us, whatever our politics, want Wales to succeed in its entirety, as well to fight for a fair deal for our constituencies. It is the enemies of Wales who try to play one part off against another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason why this is an historic meeting is that no Conservative Members were elected in Wales. That was the decision of the Welsh people in the general election and is an incontrovertible indicator that Welsh politics are different from English politics. The difference in the political values is one of the cornerstones of our nationality. The Welsh Grand Committee exists because Wales is a nation, but we have no power to act as a Committee. We have only the right to discuss and debate in case we implement those self-same values and aspirations, be they social or economic. That is why it is essential to have a Parliament or Assembly with enough power to make policy decisions in line with the needs of our country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, in this Tory-free Welsh Grand Committee it falls on us as Plaid Cymru Members, together with the Liberal Democrats, to operate as the Opposition in Wales. We shall oppose the Government when that is necessary, but we shall also give credit where credit is due. We have already indicated our intention to work positively and inclusively and, to that end, we are willing to share the Opposition Front Bench between the two parties—ourselves and the Liberal Democrats. We hope that that will be seen as a constructive step to show the way for Welsh Members across party boundaries to co-operate in a national Welsh context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a third reason why today is historic. This is the first time in five centuries that Members of Parliament in Wales have been allowed to address a formal meeting of Parliament through the medium of Welsh. It is a great honour to be among the first to take advantage of that right. It is a step forward in
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
recognising the status of Welsh and English in Wales. Today there is general support across party boundaries for the Welsh language and it is a factor that unites us. That will make it much easier for both Welsh speakers and non-Welsh speakers to unite to obtain a more democratic national Government for Wales—a central element of the Government's programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the programme that the Government have proposed, particularly to their proposals for the current session and the three headings on the agenda to which the Secretary of State referred: standard of life, quality of life and the improvement of democracy. In a recent debate in the Chamber on the Welsh Development Agency, I referred to the deterioration of living standards in Wales. The Secretary of State mentioned the reduction in GDP per head from 92 per cent. to 83 per cent. of the UK average. That is the average figure for the whole of Wales but in some old industrial areas, including slate-quarrying areas and former coalfields, and in rural areas, there are pockets of severe deprivation and tremendous poverty. In some such areas, income per head falls below 70 per cent. of the British average. That is unacceptable and it is essential that the Government's programme overcomes the deprivation in those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a cold statistical issue but the reality of everyday life for thousands and thousands of our fellow countrymen—young people who leave school and fail to find work and who are rotting on the dole and facing hopelessness; pensioners who cannot afford to heat their homes in winter or buy nourishing food; one-parent families who live in houses unfit for human habitation. That is the reality of poverty and the Government must act to overcome it. If that means using the tax system, so that we who have a comfortable standard of living contribute a bit more to help our fellow citizens who live in poverty, this Labour Government—a Labour Government of all Governments—should show their willingness to act in such a way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rhodri Morgan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> (
	<i>Translation</i>): Does the hon. Gentleman require middle-class Welsh people who are comfortably off to pay more taxes on a British scale? Or is he saying that a democratically elected body for Wales should have the right to raise its own taxes? The problem is that one cannot get blood out of a stone. It does not make sense to establish a democratic body for Wales with tax-raising powers when people cannot afford the taxes that they already pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> (
	<i>Translation</i>): Of course the Labour party must conduct its constitutional arguments within its own boundaries. I would argue that the Government should cut down on foolish expenditure, such as expenditure on Trident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was referring to the Government's programme for the coming year. In that context, we believe that we need tax-raising powers in order to have the necessary resources to realise the right policies for health and education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1117">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Carmarthen and Dinefwr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member --> (
	<i>Translation</i>)
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does the hon. Gentleman believe the people of Wales would think of raising taxes when income per head in Wales is only 83 per cent. of the British average?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> (
	<i>Translation</i>): I recall that, until about 18 months ago, the level of income tax was 25 per cent. I did not see people flocking to my surgeries urging me to reduce income tax from 25p to 23p in the pound. That 2p would be enough to add a tremendous sum to the education and health budgets where it is needed. I hope that, following the Budget this week, we may move in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One factor that contributes towards poverty is low wages. For that reason, Plaid Cymru welcomes the Government's intention to create a minimum wage. But the challenge is to set a minimum wage that is practical and effective. We believe that it should be set at £4 per hour but accept that some assistance would be necessary to enable small employers to cope with the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another factor that contributes to poverty is the unacceptably low level of state pension. The Labour party was right in 1980 to criticise the policy of the Tory Government when they broke the link between the state pension and the level of earnings. If that link had been maintained over the years, the single pension would today be £83 a week, rather than the present £62. We are disturbed that the Government have made no commitment to re-estabish the link between pensions and earnings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to defeat poverty, there must be opportunity to work rather than dependency, and Plaid Cymru has published a strategy to provide work for 100,000 people in Wales. I hope that the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Neath (Mr. Hain) will carefully consider that strategy as he faces the challenge of conquering unemployment. We must ensure that work is available in the north-west and south-west, as well as in the western valleys of the old coalfields area. In order to achieve that, we need a new strategy that establishes a framework for the activities of the Welsh Department Agency and the Development Board for Rural Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once again, I emphasise the need to develop fibre-optic links for all parts of Wales. I am worried that only the populous parts of Wales will have the opportunity to benefit from such links; that would make it much more difficult to develop the economy and attract new jobs to the west. I hope that when the Minister replies, he will be able to tell us of any developments on that important issue which have taken place during the past week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the agricultural sector, which unfortunately contributes to poverty. Hundreds of farmers in Wales today face a crisis—especially those in the beef sector, but there are also worries in the dairy sector, and uncertainty about the future among hill farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, I was surprised to hear the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food stress that the Government do not support changes in the common agricultural policy that would protect small and medium-sized farms. I believe that modulation is the
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
technical term for such a policy, which is supported by the Farmers Union of Wales. Given that it is the policy of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to support large farms in England in the name of efficiency, can I press the Minister for an assurance that that is not Welsh Office policy for Wales? Agricultural circumstances in Wales are different from those in England—that practice is a good example of that fact, which underlines the need to develop a policy in Wales that is relevant to Welsh circumstances, and, in this case, to family farms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I also say a word about the difficult circumstances faced by small shops, not only in rural areas but in our larger towns and even in cities? Many such shops have suffered when large supermarkets have been built in out-of-town locations. As a consequence, many of the centres of our historic towns—such as Caernarfon, in my constituency—have suffered enormously. During this Parliament, we must reconsider the uniform business rate in order to help small businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quality of life in Wales and standard of living interact to some extent, but quality of life means more than wealth. Health and education, environment and culture are all essential features of quality of life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the Welsh Office fulfil the Government's pledge to improve education? If we lose 500 teacher jobs in Wales this year, many schools—primary schools in particular—will experience a significant increase in their class sizes, which will mean a reduction in the quality of education offered to our children. Admittedly, that prospect is the result of Conservative policies, which have now thankfully left us, but if the Labour Government are serious about their commitment to improve education, they must provide the money to employ sufficient teachers and make appropriate provision for the higher and further education sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have acted to end nursery voucher education, which is of course something that we warmly welcome, but that will release only a small proportion of the money that we need to finance education. During the general election campaign, and again this morning, we have heard how the Government are to end the private places scheme. In Wales, that will release about £3 million. Again, that is a small proportion of the £70 million that we need. Without money on that scale, our schools and our county councils, which have the main responsibility for funding education, will face a terrible crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the election campaign, as I said in an intervention, Plaid Cymru called for a 2p increase in tax—a penny for health and a penny for education, and we still press for that. A substantial sum is needed if the NHS is to be restored in Wales. A string of community hospitals have been closed in mid and west Wales. I am pleased to hear that the threat of further closures has been lifted. However, as I said during Question Time, the North Wales health authority has broken its promises to build new community hospitals at Porthmadog and Holywell because of lack of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1118">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
finance. Morriston hospital had to sack nurses and reduce the number of beds, again because of a lack of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the coming winter, patients will be unable to get beds in hospitals. The answer is not to transfer money from one part of Wales to another; the shortages occur in all parts of Wales. The answer will come from providing additional resources. Once again, we are talking about tens of millions of pounds. So we look forward to the Budget on Wednesday, hoping that the Government will forget the rhetoric that we heard about reducing public expenditure to the amount spent by the Tories. Instead there should be fair, reasonable taxation, which would give resources to the most vulnerable people in the community—the sick, the elderly, children, young people and the disabled—and help to provide work. That is essential to improve the quality of our lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much needs to be done: we must improve the condition of houses, and additional resources are needed for the arts and the environment. If we are serious about our commitment to reduce the ill effects of pollution and global warming, we must provide better transport, thus reducing the number of cars and lorries on our roads. I hope that the Government will support the private Member's Bill of my honourable Friend the Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Dafis).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quality of life of the residents of some of our towns and villages suffers because of the deficiencies in the highway system. There are environmental as well as economic reasons for improving roads, such as the A5 across Anglesey, and I am pleased that the Secretary of State referred to that matter. There is need for bypasses for villages such as Llanllyfni and Penygroes in my constituency. However, improvements in the standard of living and the quality of life depend entirely on a determined political will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government were elected on a manifesto committed specifically to campaigning to achieve improvements in democracy in Wales. It is of some surprise to see some Labour Members straining against the bit of their own party's policy within a few weeks of winning the election. The credibility of the Labour party is at stake. We shall see the depth of its commitment to keep to its manifesto promises from the way in which its members campaign in the coming referendum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Referendums (Scotland and Wales) Bill is before the House of Lords. The referendum will offer a choice between the status quo—that is, Conservative policy—and an Assembly of the sort that the Labour party advocated at the recent election. We have already said in the Houe of Commons that we think that that choice is totally unacceptable. The people of Wales should have the option of being able to vote for a Parliament with law-making and tax-varying powers—a Parliament of the sort that the Labour party is offering to Scotland. We still await the full details of Labour's scheme, and I understand that we shall have to wait until the end of next month to see them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
Instead of criticising Labour's policies, which we have not yet seen, I shall restrict myself to stating the reasons why the status quo is totally unacceptable. The present system places enormous powers in the hands of one person—the Secretary of State for Wales, who has the power to take decisions on how to spend £70 million. The budget of the Welsh Office is more than that of the central Governments of many independent countries around the world, but the system governing the Secretary of State's answerability is totally defective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have Welsh Question Time on the Floor of the House for half an hour once a month, much of that time being swallowed up by Tory Members. We have one day annually to discuss Welsh affairs. We do not need one day a year; we need permanent supervision of the Welsh Office's policies. We have the Grand Committee itself, with a right to debate but not to take decisions. It is fair to say that the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs published many valuable reports, but the previous Government left them on dusty shelves in London and the majority of their recommendations were not debated, let alone acted on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present system does not work. The current Secretary of State recognises that, as did his predecessor in the last Labour Government, the right hon. and learned Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris). If the system is inadequate when in the hands of committed Welshmen such as those two, how much more inefficient was the system when in the hands of Secretaries of State who did not even represent Welsh constituencies?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To make matters worse, a system of government by quango has developed during the past 18 years—a system developed by the Tories to govern when they cannot win elections in Wales. They transferred portfolio after portfolio to be run without public answerability. That is our inheritance from the Tories—government through patronage, taking all real power to the centre. That has created in Wales one of the most centralised and insensitive political systems in the western world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we talk about a Parliament for Wales or an elected Assembly, let no one say that we are introducing another tier of local government. That is absolute nonsense—that tier of government already exists in the Welsh Office and in the quangos. The Tories, of course, will fight like demented rottweilers against change, because it would undermine their ability to govern when they cannot secure a democratic mandate. What I cannot for the life of me understand is the logic of members of any party who claim to be democrats but support this rotten status quo.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another reason to reject the status quo is the growth of the European Union since 1979. Many decisions that were once taken in London are now taken in Brussels, and Wales needs to have a much stronger voice there. It is worth noting how regional governments such as those of Bavaria in Germany and of Catalonia in Spain have been able, as the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) said, to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1119">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
develop a strong and effective voice in Brussels through having their own parliaments and governments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the Redwood era at the Welsh Office, we saw how Wales' need to have a strong voice in Brussels was totally ignored because of the Secretary of State's prejudice. Our industrialists and farmers paid an enormous price for that. There is no doubt that, in a European context, the status quo is totally unacceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Môn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member --> (
	<i>Translation</i>)
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend has read the detailed report by the Welsh affairs institute calling for the establishment of a powerful office in Europe to enable any democratic institution in Wales to have a real voice there.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> (
	<i>Translation</i>): Yes, I do indeed welcome that. I think it vital that Wales has just as effective a voice in Brussels as Scotland will have once it has its Parliament. If we do not keep up with Scotland, we are in danger of losing out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, we in Wales need to develop policies that are in line with out values and the wishes of our people. We must have policies on housing, education, the social services, agriculture and the environment that correspond with the needs of Wales and not the wishes of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My party and I believe that the status quo is not acceptable. In the referendum, no one who suports the Labour Party, the Liberals, the Green Party or Plaid Cymru should vote for the status quo.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is our attitude to the alternatives that will be offered in the referendum in September? The truth is that we cannot adequately evaluate and analyse the proposals until the White Paper is published next month. In the meantime, I can only outline what we want from the White Paper for the Assembly to provide a better system of government for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall be looking for an Assembly which is democratically elected and whose membership reflects as accurately as possible the political balance in Wales. It should also have a balanced agenda. It should be sufficiently progressive to appeal to the youth of our country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Assembly should draw its powers from central Government and should not, in any shape or form, centralise the work of local government. It should have a decentralist structure, so that its members can work within the regional structure of Wales, keeping an eye on the regional quangos and developing regional policies in co-operation with local government. And, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ynys Môn said, it should be powerful enough to have an effective voice in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Assembly should have a statutory right to representation in matters of education and local government—and the Welsh language, where specific laws already relate to Wales. It should at least have the power to develop such responsibilities, which are similar to those that the Scottish Parliament will take on in the next two years. It should be adequately
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
financed to operate those policies, and it should be strong enough to make a significant difference to the development of the Welsh economy and the provision of job opportunities. Those are points that Plaid Cymru Members will seek in the White Paper.

	<i>Translation</i>): Very good, Mr. Jones. Keep at it. Although you are now Chairman, I remember when you were a spokesman on behalf of the Labour party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party won a historic victory on May 1. It was elected in Wales on a platform of providing new democratic structures for our country, and a strong and effective elected Assembly. The Labour party said that the only way to secure such a democratically elected Assembly for Wales was to elect a Labour Government. That has happened, and it is now time for the Labour Government to show the people of Wales exactly how effective that Assembly will be. It is time to explain the details, clarify the proposals and persuade the electors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour Government were elected on a definite pledge to the people of Wales. We now look to see whether the Government will keep their promise. If the Labour Government succeed in persuading the people of Wales to vote yes in the referendum, we shall thereafter work as a constructive and creative Opposition to secure the best possible structure to improve the system of Welsh government. In that regard, as with their programmes for improving the standard of living and the quality of life in Wales, an enormous responsibility rests on the Government's shoulders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wish the Secretary of State for Wales well in his work and we hope that when the Committee next returns to Wales, there will be evidence of its direct benefit to everyone, wherever in Wales they reside, and whatever their political colour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Many parts of the Government's programme for Wales will bring great joy to the constituents of Delyn and other constituencies in north Wales. I listened to my right hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituents will particularly welcome the abolition of the assisted places scheme because it currently benefits fewer than 900 children in Wales. Under the new Government, the reduction in class sizes will benefit more than 70,000 children in Wales during this Parliament. I welcome the release of capital

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that, in the first weeks of a Labour Government, the Grand Committee has come to Mold shows my right hon. Friend's commitment to north Wales; when the referendum takes place, I look forward to strong support from my constituents and from all constituents in north Wales for my right hon. Friend's great efforts in producing the Assembly proposals. I would just add that I would welcome some comments on agriculture from my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend in his winding-up speech, because many of my constituents who work in the industry were concerned about the previous Government's handling of the beef crisis.

Given the limited time that we have today, I wish to focus on two items. First, youth unemployment; the Government have a strong commitment to tackle youth unemployment, on which I am sure that the Chancellor of the Exchequer will elaborate in his Budget speech this Wednesday. I would welcome the commitment of my hon. Friends who represent constituencies in Wales to increasing the number of jobs available to the under-25s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many members of the Committee campaigned vigorously during the election to ensure that the key Labour pledge of getting the under-25s back to work using the tax on the privatised utilities was a major factor in our election victory. I hope that the Minister will give strong emphasis to that pledge and to how we can interpret it in Wales in the near future. The cost to the taxpayer of unemployment in Wales is currently more than £800 million a year. That is the Conservative legacy that has left many young people in our constituencies unemployed. There are currently nearly 27,000 unemployed under-25s in Wales who are waiting for the Labour Government initiatives that will assist them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my own constituency of Delyn there are about 600 unemployed under-25s. The Government have a strong commitment, outlined last week by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer—which I know my right hon. and hon. Friends in the Welsh Office strongly support—to offer every young person under 25 in Wales who has been out of work for more than six months a positive choice. I particularly welcome that and I look forward to hearing about our proposals to offer unemployed young people in Wales jobs with private and voluntary sector employers, full-time study on approved courses, or work on environmental task forces, to allow them to participate not only in improving the quality of life in north Wales but in the creation of employment. I am sure that as a result of our Grand Committee and the Budget on Wednesday, people in Wales will be in a strong position to create jobs for unemployed under-25s—paid for by a one-off windfall tax on the privatised utilities which have made a significant contribution to
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
the profits of their own companies: profits which, over the past few years, have been inflated. The Government's proposals to use that money to put young people back to work in Wales will be strongly welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make a plea today to businesses, particularly those in north Wales, voluntary organisations or organisations that can offer employment, training and job opportunities to young people to get in touch with my colleagues in the Welsh Office, because I know that they will seek strong support in north Wales so that we can take up our share of the Chancellor's proposals on job creation, bringing wealth and opportunity back to our young people in north Wales. I want the proposals to succeed because my constituents face the harsh frustrations of unemployment, crime, poverty arising from lack of opportunity and real need—problems that the Government will address.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much agree with my hon. Friend's plea to businesses and others in north Wales.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to hear that from my hon. Friend. I want him to have contact with the voluntary organisations, small businesses, trade unions and the big operating companies in north Wales who can bring young people back into the job market and give them a purpose in life. They will pay taxes and create wealth, which will pay for my pension and my children's future in north Wales. I very much welcome my hon. Friend's commitments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue that I want to discuss is the Government's commitment to the minimum wage. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State did not mention it in detail today, but I feel strongly about the minimum wage in Wales. As has been mentioned, low pay is prevalent throughout large parts of Wales, including my constituency. I visited one of the jobcentres in my constituency this morning. Most of the jobs did not advertise pay levels and when I rang to find out, they were low. Some showing the pay included an advertisement for a hairdresser at £55 a week for a 39-hour week, and a fast-food outlet which was offering less than £2.70 an hour. Those are low levels of pay which the commission on low pay must examine when it is set up. I ask my right hon. Friend to ensure that that commission has a strong Welsh input to reflect the needs of this part of the world. It should be formed soon so that the scourge of low pay can be ended in Delyn and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware of the time, Mr. Jones, and I am grateful for your indulgence, although I could have said more. I very much appreciate the Government's programme for Wales. They are a strong Government with a mandate from the people of Wales. The Assembly will help to strengthen that mandate, and I welcome the Government's programme today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms Julie Morgan 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for calling me, Mr. Jones. I am very pleased to have this opportunity to speak in the Welsh Grand Committee for the first time. Not all that I have heard about the Committee has been entirely favourable, but it is a unique opportunity for all Members of Parliament from Wales to come together to scrutinise the Government's programme. As the Government are so new, we are looking forward to discussing what they will be doing, rather than what has been done by Governments in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members have asked why the gross domestic product in Wales is 17 per cent. below the British average. In the past 18 years, the gap has grown larger. I do not want to knock the agencies in Wales that have worked hard towards inward investment, but the present system has not succeeded. There is a long way to go and we need a long-term strategy to improve the skills of the work force and reduce the prosperity gap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative Government allowed the apprenticeship scheme to wither away, and it ended in the 1980s. It was not until the last three years of their term that they introduced the modern apprenticeship scheme under the training and enterprise councils. It was a late conversion, arrived at because the previous Government realised that the skills base in the Welsh labour force had become so weak. Unfortunately, that modern apprenticeship scheme has repeated one of the faults of the old one, with women being generally under-represented and excluded from most of the industrial skill areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential to rebuild the skills of the Welsh work force, taking everybody into account. We must train the whole population. In south Wales, for example, the demand for engineers will be critical because of the LG development. There are concerns among established engineering firms and some that have arrived only recently about whether LG will be able to outbid them for their existing skilled work force. Such a major issue must be addressed. There is panic about the poaching of the skills in Wales, especially now that engineering courses are closing down. Last year, two such courses ended in the University of Wales, Institute of Cardiff, and some were closed in Newport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the new Government, we must plan and have a strategy—all the things that the previous Government found anathema. We must look at the funding mechanisms for our courses in higher education and further education, particularly in subjects such as technology, science and engineering. We must also examine the role models that are provided for boys and girls in the 14 to 15 age group when they start to make choices. As well as upgrading the general skills base, we must change our attitude to industry and think of careers, not jobs. That applies especially to women because those industries in Wales that have employed women have not offered careers in industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as improving the skills base, we should consider child care an essential part of the infrastructure of economic development as well as telecommunications. That will enable the entire work
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
force to become involved. Under the previous Government, there was a big growth in after-school clubs, breakfast clubs and holiday play care schemes, but those developments have been ad hoc and dependent on short-term funding. Research has shown that people who use those schemes are parents who are not on low incomes. Umemployed people do not use them and the women who take advantage of them, in particular, already have professional skills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to ensure that there is affordable child care in Wales, We need strategy. A concerted effort must be made to target resources to take into account the various needs that exist throughout Wales—in the rural areas and those suffering acute deprivation—as well as taking into account language needs. I welcome especially the announcement of my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend, who said last week that he would be considering all the grants and trying to target them efficiently and implement the strategic planning that was lacking under the previous Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer finally to the advantages that a Welsh Assembly would bring to Wales if it involved the people of Wales directly in planning their economic future. There is no pressure like direct democratic pressure to make politicians deliver the goods. Although it has no power, the Welsh Grand Committee is valuable because it enables us to ventilate our grievances. However, because it has no power, the next logical step forward is to move from sittings of the Committee to sittings of the Welsh Grand Assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to speak for only five minutes, Mr. Jones. I wish to make two short points because many members of the Committee want to speak and the last thing that I want to do is to prevent any hon. Member from so doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first point concerns the Welsh Assembly. When questioned about the Government and how they wish to be governed, people in north Wales and south Wales say, "Yes, the nearer it is to us, the better." Yet, when asked about a Welsh Assembly, they say, "Well, I don't know about that; I have some problems with it." People say that such an Assembly will cost more; that it will lead to more bureaucrats; the there are enough levels of administration in the United Kingdom; and that such matters are carried out at Westminster and to leave well alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such problems must be solved, one of which I shall deal with. In north Wales, a great mass of people—those who are not committed one way or the other—are worried that, if a Welsh Assembly were set up, it would be run by south Wales. By saying that, I am saying nothing nasty about my colleagues and friends from south Wales. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, when he produces the White Paper,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1122">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
answers that question clearly and assures the people of north Wales that they have nothing to fear from an Assembly being dominated by south Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A committee representing north Wales would not be good enough; more is needed. We must be assured that we will receive our fair share of resources. We do not need more than our fair share; it would not matter if we received marginally less, but we would be upset if we thought that we would receive a lot less than our fair share of resources, in relation to industrial develpment, education, the health service and so on. It is vital that we in north Wales, in wanting regional government in Wales—a Welsh Assembly—should be assured in the White Paper that such powers will not simply be handed to south Walians, leaving us to be the tail on the dog.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point concerns the millennium exhibition and the dome. I know that my party is in favour of it; its wants a large dome built in Greenwich, a place where I have never been. Hundreds of millions of pounds will be spent. With respect, I think that—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I think that the money could be better spent. I am not against the project—if it is what people want to do. I wish to make a plea. I appeal to local companies in Wales, especially to those in north Wales: please do not spend money on the dome in Greenwich. We have schools in which the latest books in their geography or history departments are 30 years old. Windows in schools are falling out of their frames. The health service is impoverished. I plead with companies in north Wales: do not give a penny to that dome in Greenwich. If people in the south-east want to give money, I have no problem with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask companies to do something for us in north Wales as a community. Get together; if necessary, get together and erect an exhibition centre in north Wales. I should not mind that. But, preferably, let us spend the money on education and the health service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member --> (
	<i>Translation</i>)
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like many others, I was glad that the Government's manifesto emphasised education. The background paper, which the Secretary of State has kindly distributed, makes that emphasis obvious, which is good. Every sector of education in Wales is in deep and serious crisis which we must immediately recognise and try to reverse. I was also glad to hear the Secretary of State re-emphasise education during his opening speech this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
As time is short, I shall refer only to tertiary and further education in Wales, especially MeirionDwyfor college. The funding council has said that the college must cut 20 per cent. from its present budget, which means that it will lose about £300,000 a year over three years. Labour is one factor that will create some difficulty. As everyone knows, labour is the main item in the budget and lecturing, administrative and managerial posts will be in danger unless there is a change in the budget. There are about 100 members of staff and it is fair to say that several are under serious threat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are always hearing from the Opposition that there are staffing problems, a crisis and so on. But the reality is that there is a serious crisis at the college, though one that could be solved by proper funding. Already, Meirion-Dwyfor college has been praised for the standard of education that it provides and for its results. It is important to ensure the college's continuation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One factor that creates particular difficulty is that there is no fair funding formula to fund both tertiary colleges and sixth forms in schools—we must have fairness. The current formula is based on growth in numbers, but there is no possibility of growth in Meirion-Dwyfor college's catchment area, which is wide, but has a small population. Owing to the population and geography, the college is situated on three campuses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that Meirion Dwyfor college is unique in having a virtual monopoly on sixth-form education in its area; there is only one secondary school in the catchment area. Those exceptional circumstances deserve particular attention when we try to respond to its needs. When funding has been considered, too much emphasis has been placed on numbers and head counting. We need a more fairly balanced system—one that regularises the situation between sixth forms in schools and the tertiary colleges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to the area's rural nature and low population. That factor is apparent in the Select Committee's report on the question of further education in Wales. One of the report's strongest recommendations is that the Government should raise the level of importance of an area's rural nature and the heavy pressure on its, colleges. I appeal to the Government to take the opportunity to rectify that problem. Additional pressures may be put on the budget. That is partly recognised, but, at present, no financial assistance exists to assist streaming and the balance of the two languages, so that means of teaching is far less effective and can be very stressful for lecturers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 10 March the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs published a report that concluded that far more bilingual provision is needed. The Select Committee urged the Government to examine the medium of Welsh and methods to ensure that it is used far more extensively. I hope that the Government will respond positively to that problem, which causes great concern to the staff at Meirion-Dwyfor college. That college can offer exceptionally good education through the medium of Welsh. According to a recent bulletin of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1123">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
funding council, the college will increase its bilingual education provision and will further recognise the rural nature of the area. We hope that the Government will listen to that advice. We urge the Government to reconsider as quickly as possible the level of funding of the further education sector. Those points are relevant to the current situation at Meirion-Dwyfor college. It is important that the Government respond positively and as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently, I have met with members of Unison, the National Union of Teachers, the National Union of Welsh Teachers, the Union of Higher and Further Education Lecturers, the lecturers of Meirion-Dwyfor college, and members of the student union. They have genuine concerns. The National Union of Welsh Teachers comments:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Dwyfor and Meirionnydd have been through a period of rationalisation in post-16 education. It is completely unfair to face another pressure which would lead to a deterioration in standards and a loss of jobs...a bilingual college is important to the future of the Welsh language in this area. We need vocational courses of the highest quality to maintain skills that will help to enliven an economy affected by the closure of the power station and the agricultural crisis. Many of the buildings and resources of the college are new and of the best possible standard. Much work is needed to be done with some buildings. That college must be built on a firm basis to ensure the future of this area and education in this sector."</p></blockquote>
That problem needs speedy and detailed attention. We do not have to mention cuts in education: the Government have a positive mandate to rule and one of their main aims was to improve education. The tertiary college and education in general call for improvement and deserve more attention. By the way—and brief y, Mr. Jones; I can see you looking at me—we should question the role of TECs in this regard. A lot of money goes into TECs, but what on earth comes out is another matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must review expenditure programmes and ensure that money is made available; we must not always discuss cuts and more cuts. We must look positively at such matters. It is said that politics is the art of the possible. Certainly it is possible to find the money to support education. That would be the best proof of the Government's good intentions. Do they want to put education at the top of their programme or was their support of it simply cynical politics?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot help but be drawn by the comments of the hon. Members for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) and for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley). They produced a long shopping list, and it is in their constituents' interests to ask for what they want from the new Labour Government. They asked for help in several areas, including increased spending on health, education and highways. I agree with many of their requests. However, a fundamental contradiction is involved. The hon. Gentlemen support self-government and independence for Wales, but their policies are based on an income per capita that is 83 per cent. of the figure for the rest of the country. That would involve severely depressed living standards. One cannot have such wretchedness and a policy that
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
would destroy the present level of pensions, healthcare, education expenditure and so on. However, I leave the argument there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had a wonderful victory on 1 May—it was the Labour party's greatest victory in a general election—and we have a strong mandate to implement our policies. We do not have a radical programme; it is cautious and tightly costed. The pledges that we made to the electorate obviously found resonance in people's hearts and minds. Many people in my constituency who did not vote for me have said how surprised and delighted they are with the way in which the Labour Government have met so many pledges within just two months of taking office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are off to a flying start, in the Welsh Office and nationally: the assisted places scheme has gone; the nursery vouchers scheme will be phased out; and cuts in NHS bureaucracy are already under way, which will release money to provide, for example, breast cancer treatment. The welfare-to-work programme is a major initiative that will reach every depressed little area in our constituencies, and help will be proportionate to the extent of unemployment. There will be a major announcement in the Budget on Wednesday. It has been a wonderful story so far during our first two months in office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a question to my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) earlier today, I referred to the problems in the health service in my constituency, which are severe. There are serious problems in the NHS nationally—they are perhaps more pressing than those in other areas of our social life. I cannot help but wonder whether, as a result of being so cautious in office and anxious to meet the pledges that we made during the general election, we are being too cautious in our approach to this subject. The programme was thrown up a year or two ago under different economic circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are now in the middle of a boom with virtually uncontrolled consumer spending. We see the value of the pound moving higher and higher; it is now 20 per cent. higher than in January 1995. I know that the Secretary of State is not in charge of the budget but he may have some influence in the Cabinet and if ever there was a time for tax and spend, it is in the forthcoming budget. If the boom is allowed to continue uncontrolled, the Bank of England will push up interest rates and the pound will rise even higher into the stratosphere beyond the level of black Wednesday. If that happens, we shall be planning our own downfall in two years because boom will be followed by bust. I hope that in his Budget our Chancellor will take £5 billion, £6 billion or £7 billion out of the economy and use it in the health service and education, and to cut the public service borrowing requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of those matters are beyond the control of the Secretary of State, but I wish that we could review our policy. I know that that was not the full programme on which we were elected and we are anxious to deliver accurately the policies on which we were elected. In
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1124">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
present circumstances public opnion would be overwhelmingly in our support if we were to take such measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Wales we made a further pledge on the subject of an Assembly. The Referendums (Scotland and Wales) Bill has made excellent progress in the House and the referendum is due to be held in the autumn. Like some of my hon. Friends, I wish that quangos, particularly some of the all-Wales quangos mentioned in the White Paper, will eventually be covered by our Bill. I would like the referendum in Wales to be held on the same date as the referendum in Scotland. I am concerned that we are leaving ourselves exposed to the accusation of manipulating the electorate and using a strong yes vote in Scotland to create a bandwagon in Wales, which would be unfair. It would be better for the referendums to be held on the same dates. If the debate in Scotland is strongly in favour and colours the debate in Wales, the result would still be positive. It would be better received throughout the country if the referendums were held on the same day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Smith), who is not in his place now, and our other Back-Bench colleagues, should be given the freedom to speak their minds for or against. My position has always been strongly for an Assembly. The Minister without Portfolio, the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson) got the balance about right on "Any Questions" last Saturday. He said that, in the lead-up to the referendum, Back Benchers should be allowed the freedom to express their own views; after the referendum, when the people of Wales and Scotland have spoken, Back Benchers should be bound by the specific endorsement of the second policy; and the three-line Whip should start next October in the House. That was my understanding of the comments of the Minister without Portfolio and that is what I want to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a danger of a no vote, but I am confident that there will be a 60 per cent. yes vote in Wales. In a democracy people may not always think in the way we think they think. I was concerned by the opinion poll carried out by the 
	<i>Western Mail</i> and reported on the eve of the election on 30 April. I had other things on my mind at the time and only a week or two later did I reflect properly on why that poll, unlike any other poll on devolution in the past 15 years, gave a no vote. It suggested that 34 per cent. would vote yes, 37 per cent. would vote no and about 30 per cent. did not know. I believe that the main reason for the result was that at that time a Labour Government seemed a certainty. The people of Wales wanted a Labour Government more than anything; they wanted the right hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) to be Secretary of State for Wales, with the hon. Members for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) and for Neath (Mr. Hain), doing their excellent work as Under-Secretaries of State for Wales. But now that they have a Labour Government they are not so bothered about the Assembly. That is the fact of life for the large majority of the electorate in Wales. We have a Labour Government with a massive mandate—a majority of
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
179—who look as if they will be in power for the next 10 years or more, as we all hope. But the question of the Assembly is subsidiary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason—I know that this may cause controversy—is that, in the early part of the year, the devolution argument was presented as one of political conflict. In the Labour party, we argued our policy and, naturally, we were opposed by the Conservatives but we were also opposed by the nationalist party, who continually attacked our proposals for not going far enough. The more the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) and other members of the nationalist party attack our proposals and call for a powerhouse parliament, the less that the people of Glamorgan, Clwyd and Gwent want to do with it. They do not want separation, nationalism or an Assembly that represents a step towards an independent Wales. My two wishes are that, over the next few months, the nationalist party—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The way to get a yes vote is for the Labour party, Labour Members of Parliament, Labour councilors and Labour-controlled authorities—as most of them are in Wales—to tell Labour supporters to vote for Labour party policy. In that way, we will achieve a resounding yes vote in an autumn referendum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am also glad to be back in this chamber, which I frequented—causing trouble at the back—for 10 years. During that time, I often talked to people who were demonstrating in the entrance hall but in all that time, I never saw such a false, staged demonstration. It took all the remaining Tory party voters in Wales to stand outside county hall today. Of course it was Clwyd county council in my day, whereas it is now Flintshire. When I used to sit here, I sat on the Labour side and all this area was taken up by independent Members. I hope that is not a sign that all hon. Members sitting in the middle are going independent, although one or two may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the demonstration outside seemed to consist almost entirely of former Tory candidates, which makes it all the more bizarre that they should claim their right to be in the Committee—because they failed democratically to be elected. I was pleased that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State pointed out that they had had the opportunity to come here because that has been obscured by all their rantings about democracy.

	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
I am especially pleased that the Welsh Grand Committee is meeting in North Wales. We have an historic opportunity to show what can be achieved by a Welsh Assembly, which is something that many people in north Wales are dubious about. Today's debate is about the Government's proposals for Wales and the future of Wales. We have already seen speedy action by the Government on a variety of issues that are important to the people of Wales. We have seen a new deal on compulsory competitive tendering, which has meant that many councillors in Wales have not had to spend a lot of much-needed ratepayers' money on going through the ideological nonsense of setting up compulsory competitive tendering rounds this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have also scrapped the wasteful and needless nursery voucher scheme—a decision which has been welcomed throughout Wales. There have been proposals for the promotion of life-long learning and, most importantly—I shall come to it later—there is legislation for a Welsh Assembly. That is all in addition to a variety of other fast-track initiatives that will benefit the whole United Kingdom. For example, only today, I was congratulated on Labour's stance on late payments, which will be vital in helping many small businesses in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the Government's positive attitude and the blistering pace they have set, I would like to flag up some issues that are important to our constituencies in order to ensure that they are not neglected in the rush. The plight of Welsh farmers—especially beef farmers—has already been mentioned, and it should not be forgotten. Additional help is vital and it must be given in some way. In many cases, the problem is not one of providing immediate financial help, even though that would be useful, but of maintaining constant pressure on Europe, for example, to enable the beef ban to be lifted. Negotiations by my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food have already resulted in the recent decision taken by McDonald's. It may seem a minor matter, but its decision is of huge benefit to the beef industry because McDonald's buys £30 million worth of the less tasty parts of the animal—[

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was talking of the welcome news that McDonald's have agreed to buy British Beef. [
	<i>Interruption</i>] My hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) tells me that I ought to start from the beginning again, but I doubt whether that would be popular, as many hon. Members wish to speak. Suffice it to say that farmers' interests will not, I hope, be forgotten.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all aware that we have entered an age in which environmentalism means more than simply biodiversity; it represents an opportunity to rethink the way in which we create jobs, work the land, produce our food, design our homes, travel and run our economy. Added to this is the issue of scale. I draw the Committee's attention to the benefits of small-scale, woodland-based manufacturing communes in reviving rural areas: to the problem of finding affordable housing for rural workers: and to the potential benefits of low-impact developments such as those based on permaculture principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the framework of planning will, if we are to take advantage of these new directions, depend on a strong planning systems that defends our natural heritage while allowing development that fits strict environmental criteria. The opportunities provided by our new thinking on sustainability should not be missed, nor allowed to dominate us. In my view, Wales, more than any other area of the United Kingdom, has a historic opportunity to shape itself into an economy of the future as well as of the present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am looking forward to the new Wales—wide agri-environment scheme, which is an excellent way forward. Clearly we must move towards a system of agricultural support which marries food production with the custodial element of farming, with the emphasis more on creating sustainable jobs in vibrant, local, rural economies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many hon. Members are concerned about public transport generally, but I am particularly concerned about rural public transport and especially rural bus services. The fact that services often end before the film at the cinema finishes is an unhumorous anecdote of rural life. It should not be that way. Such absurd realities isolate people and must be addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Transport infrastructure also has a significant bearing on inward investment. That does not mean that we should walk the Tory treadmill of building road after road around the larger urban areas of north and south Wales. Thankfully the Government are conducting a major review of road building as part of their plan to develop a fully integrated tranpsort system. Numerous examples and a command of basic economics show that new roads to link rural villages to large towns invariably suck jobs out of the villages instead of providing a new market. As I touched on earlier, there is great scope for rural areas to create their own local economies.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1126">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
I want to refer to the Welsh Development Agency and its impact on Wales generally. The WDA, which was established by a previous Labour Government on a policy of intervention and partnership, has, despite cuts and some dodgy appointments by the Tory Government, continued to serve as an example of the validity of that policy. Over the past few years, more jobs have been created, relative to other areas in Wales, in Wrexham and Flintshire than in Anglesey and Gwynedd, as my colleagues from west Wales mentioned earlier. That has been used to suggest that there is a bias in the system, but the figures reveal that Wrexham and Flintshire, which have more than twice as many working-age people as Anglesey and Gwynedd, have not done much more than double the number of jobs created in those areas.The underlying reason why Anglesey and Gwynedd do not do better is possibly that some local councils have a bad record of putting in project bids. Denbighshire and Conwy are probably the real problem areas. I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench will encourage bids from the areas which are not creating so many jobs by putting projects forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wales is well placed to take advantage of the growing demand for so-called green products, not only in the farming sector but in the rapidly growing environmental engineering and technology sector, particularly in relation to new developments in cleaner transport and renewable energy. The expertise is already here in Wales, not just in our innovative private enterprises but in other organisations such as the Centre for Alternative Technology and our excellent academic institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members have touched on education in this debate. That is natural, because education is, and always has been, at the heart of Welsh thought as a way of improving the lives of Welsh people. It is good that we are getting rid of nursery vouchers, but one area that I hope my right hon. and hon. Friends will look at is the secondary sector. We are getting help in the primary sector because the nursery voucher scheme is being removed and money is being put into reducing class sizes. That is great. We are also reviewing the 18 to 25-year-old sector, but my secondary schools, and I am sure those in the constituencies of my colleagues, are suffering and have suffered very badly over the past 18 years. I hope that the Government will look at ways to help secondary education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had much to say about devolution, but I am sure that you will not mind if I cut it out, Mr. Jones. Suffice to say that I urge hon. Members throughout Wales to go out and campaign for a yes vote. Wales needs an Assembly. Decisions are best taken by the people of Wales and should be taken by the people of Wales. The Assembly will give Wales the tools to take a strategic grip on its own development, with added strength and unity from being part of the United Kingdom. Beside democratising existing Welsh Office functions, it will have power to control and reform the quangoes and, in time, I hope, additional powers to make secondary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
Never have the Government been so committed to delivering a much-needed Assembly. I hope that all hon. Members and all those who are listening to our proceedings will go away and campaign for the yes vote, for the betterment of the people of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Wales has reason to be optimistic, not just because the number of Liberal Democrat Members has increased by 100 per cent. to the wonderful number of two, but because there seems to be a genuinely new atmosphere in Welsh politics. It is an atmosphere so sweeping that even the Conservatives have been moved to send a delegation here this morning to campaign positively for proportional representation—something that we Liberal Democrats clearly support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we can be inclusive, and I applaud what the Secretary of State said about that. From the Liberal Democrats' standpoint, the signs are good; we feel that we are being included and we thank the Government for including us so much. That does not mean that we have adopted the Government's policies, but that we expect to contribute in a period of constructive Opposition. We seek to add value to the outcome of debates rather than simply to detract from that process. I will not, therefore, read out the long Liberal Democrat manifesto on Wales, but will instead add to the debate by making some new points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am encouraged by the commitment to education. The Liberal Democrats' main concern is to ensure that the money backs up the promises. Clearly, help is needed for the buildings. The teachers need proper funding and facilities are needed at all levels. We were glad to see the back of the nursery voucher scheme and we hope that that will be replaced by a much more acceptable and equitable scheme of nursery education provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On health, I simply reiterate the point that we have made many times before. Cottage hospitals are important in the rural environment to ensure that local services and local health provision are maintained. We hope that some direct and fast action can be taken to eliminate the two tiers in health provision. The third area that particularly concerns mid Wales is the declining standard of ambulance service provision. If that problem is not resolved soon, there will be a crisis that ends in a fatality. We press the Minister to work on that and we thank him for the interest that he has taken so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to focus on three other subjects: the cultural considerations, the infrastructure and a few democratic points. There is an opportunity for the elected representatives of Wales to start giving the Welsh culture the respect that it deserves. Apart from the obvious importance of establishing the Welsh language on an equal basis—I will do the best that I can over the summer recess to make my contribution to that—we must also take action in more subtle ways. A very simple piece of legislation could resolve the iniquity whereby a child who, for medical reasons, has to be born across the border in Shrewsbury hospital, cannot have a Welsh birth certificate. That could be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1127">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
fixed easily and cheaply. We will be working with the Minister to try to rectify such matters and I hope that we can get some quick and early wins.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may not be able to build domes in the air, but we can create some more lasting and sustainable opportunities to enjoy Welsh culture and perhaps open it up to incomers who sometimes feel excluded by the more traditional Eisteddfods. We would like to be involved in any process to open up the arts and Welsh culture to those who have chosen Wales as their home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of infrastructure, freight on the rails is a necessity. There is no logical reason why the north-south lines and the east-west lines could not be used to shift much of the haulage that is currently carried by road. The infrastructure already partly exists. With judicious use of existing money perhaps we can achieve some quick, cheap wins.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have an opportunity to act quickly to encourage investment in a regional transport network across Wales. If there were a Welsh Assembly, that network would be essential, as well as advantageous in attracting industry to more remote areas. I have an interest because mid Wales is difficult to get to. Welshpool airport has some great ideas to expand its commercial role: perhaps that is something which we can consider creatively and work towards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, I am concerned about the impact of the rural economy on the infrastructure. Farmers have had a bad time because of the BSE crisis and other problems. The strength of the pound is also driving down Welsh lamb and beef prices. Perhaps we could do something to make it easier for Welsh farmers to sell their produce here. The ultimate answer would be the lifting of the beef ban but, in the short term, we must be sensitive to investing in Welsh farming and agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a democratic note, it is known that we would support a yes vote in a referendum as a matter of common sense rather than of risk. The Welsh people are capable of governing themselves, and I hope that we can put through the Labour party's timid but positive proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I have no small concern about money. Many of the Government's promises involve expenditure. We will await to see what happens in the Budget. I would strongly oppose any suggestion that those proposals be dropped because of a lack of funds. I reiterate that direct general taxation is the sensible, and perhaps the most fair, way to fund them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, we are encouraged by the way in which things have begun, and by the atmosphere of today's Committee. We shall play our part constructively and, if we can make ourselves a model for regional and indeed national government, we shall have not only served the people of Wales well but served the democratic process satisfactorily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for his announcement that the Chepstow hospital development will go ahead, and for the news about the new day hospital endoscopy unit at Nevill Hall hospital. I assure my right hon. Friend that all this will be welcomed. I have stated publicly my reservations about the use of the private finance initiative in essential public services such as education and health, but I am pleased that negotiations which began before the general election will continue. However, I regret the possible impact of the PFI on another health service development in my constituency—the Red Barn project near Nevill Hall hospital. According to that project a large former psychiatric hospital in Pen y Fal was closed. Gwent health authority's programme stated that Pen y Fal would not be closed completely until the Red Barn development was opened to provide day hospital provision for elderly and mentally ill patients in a new modern facility next to Nevill Hall hospital. I saw the plan and was slightly disturbed to see in a corner of it the logo of P and 0, a well-known development and shipping organisation. It saddened me that such organisations have such impact. I am not saying that P and 0 is totally responsible for what has happened to that initiative—the fault lies largely with Gwent health authority, which, in common with so many health authorities, puts mental health services fairly low down its list of priorities. The loss of the Red Barn development is an example of that. The consultant psychiatrists in Maindiff Court hospital, who are currently looking after a small number of mentally-ill patients, say that the decision is "catastrophic".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent months, I have had the pleasure of visiting a number of schools in my constituency, especially primary schools. I have visited all of the comprehensive schools and a number of the primary schools. The message I get from all those schools, especially from primary and infant schools, is that class size counts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Monmouthshire education authority has been held in high respect by schools and by the teachers to whom I have talked. There have been good relationships between Monmouthshire county council—and the former Gwent county council—and local schools. The schools that I have visited include Llanfoist, Shirenewton, which I visited last Saturday, Trellech, Croesyceiliog, Ponthir, Our Lady and St. Michael, which is a grant-maintained Catholic school in my constituency, and which I had the pleasure of visiting to present some awards last Friday, and the lovely little school on the Rother estate in Abergavenny, Llwynu school. A number of those schools suffer from large class sizes, and I am heartened by the announcement made by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary about the Government's commitment to reducing class sizes for five and six-year-olds. It is important that we are seen to deliver on that programme.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1128">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
I also thank my hon. Friend for attending a meeting last week about Gwent tertiary college, which I understand to be the largest educational institution in Wales, and which has recently suffered tremendous financial problems. That is our inheritance from a form of management instigated by the previous Conservative Government. The principal of that college has now been suspended, which is unfortunate, because it means that some of the other charges of managerial incompetence, which may have been the responsibility of the governing body, will now be directed to him. People will say that it was the principal's fault, but the principal had been in place for only two years, had inherited a difficult position and introduced a number of managerial changes. It is regrettable that 100 members of staff at the college were put onto a new managerial spine, as it was called, last year, only to be made redundant this year. Something is seriously wrong with that situation, and I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain) has called for the report that has been produced about that college to be published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a tremendous amount of dedication in the further education sector. It has always been one of the less glamorous areas of education—I say that as someone who has spent his professional life in higher rather than further education. The further education sector is vitally important, providing as it does both vocational and academic courses. It relies to a high degree on part-time staff, many of whose jobs are now in jeopardy because of decisions about full-time staff redundancies. I hope that colleagues in the Welsh Office will consider the situation and come to some arrangement. We know that a load of money cannot be provided to compensate for past problems, but I hope that the situation will be considered sensitively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to another area of concern in my consitutency: transport. I have made representations to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary about the Llanelan bridge—a dangerous bridge that carries the A404 up to Abergavenny. It has no pathway, so pedestrians are frightened to use it, and not many of them do so. That does not demonstrate that the bridge is not needed; it demonstrates the need for a footbridge. The people of Llanelan would be pleased if my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and other colleagues would reconsider the problem of that bridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also draw my hon. Friend's attention to another important bridge in my constituency—the beautiful Monnow bridge, which dates back to the 14th or 15th century, and which still carries the main access road into the town of Monmouth. As a result of the opening of the new Waitrose supermarket development at the bottom of Monmouth by the Monnow bridge, there is a tremendous amount of traffic. It is unsustainable to keep that bridge open for heavy traffic—for lorries and coaches—and I hope that Monmouthshire county council will find the capacity to invest in the development of a new bridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) mentioned the importance of rail freight. There is a good proposal for a Euro-freight terminal in Magor, just outside my consitutency. Were it not for the delay in decision-making, the project could have been up and running. The decision has still not been made and I hope that the Secretary of State and other ministerial colleagues will consider the proposal with sympathy, as it is well advanced. The lines are already there, the site is right next to the main line and the terminal will have the support of the Llanwern steelworks. The project will be of tremendous benefit to south-east Wales; it will take many heavy lorries off the road and put freight on to the rail network going straight into Europe through the new channel tunnel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next Friday, the Monmouthshire says yes to the Assembly campaign will be launched in Usk. I do not want to gloat about this too much, but I remember the sad day in 1992 when I ceased to be the Member for Parliament for Monmouth; my successor said that that was the end of the Assembly proposals, but I pledged that I would try to win the seat back to be part of the campaign for an Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most heartening aspects of the Assembly proposals is that we in Wales will pioneer a fairer electoral system, which could pave the way for a fairer system throughout the United Kingdom. Such a system already exists to some extent in Northern Ireland and now we shall introduce fairer representation in Scotland and Wales. Wales is a four-party state and we must accept that fact in the spirit of democracy and openness. We have a modest proposal to introduce the additional member system, and I pay credit to those who advanced the case for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for colleagues who have doubts about the proposed electoral system, I can only ask them to read the document "Labour's Road for Electoral Reform" by the Labour Campaign for Electoral Reform; there is no better document to convince people of the limitations and undemocratic nature of the current United Kingdom first-past-the-post system, which is fundamentally unfair. I think that it is fundamentally unfair—and I am happy to put it on the record—that the Conservative party receives 20 per cent. of the vote in Wales but no representation. That is its own fault for not supporting a fairer system, but it might now start to learn the lessons of the system's unfairness. I offer my fullest support to all who will campaign for the yes vote in the next few months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1129">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
than do a round robin on all policy areas, I want to stress my particular concern, which is education. I was a class teacher for some 15 years, but I only once taught a class with fewer than 30 pupils; many of my former colleagues have had the same experience. Labour's policy to reduce class sizes to below 30 for key stage I will go down well in my school, my constituency, throughout Wales and in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want to congratulate my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on the abolition of nursery vouchers. I fought that educational battle over recent years; it took much of the time and energy of me and many of my constituents. Walking through the Lobby for the abolition of nursery vouchers was one of the easiest tasks I have undertaken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to funding for education, one of our most fundamental considerations in Wales is how we allocate education budgets for the counties. This week, I was approached by two constituents representing different schools. They informed me that there is a set allocation in England, in that about 45 per cent. of any county's total budget must be spent on education. In Wales, there is no such system—the allocation varies between counties. We must consider whether we can learn from the English experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education is my main concern, but many hon. Members have dealt with it today, so I shall now deal with a specific matter. One of the headlines in 
	<i>The Guardian</i> today deals with the radioactive poisoning of the Irish sea. What has happened during the past decades is criminal: successive Governments have used Beaufort dyke in the Irish sea as a dumping ground for almost 50 years. I am especially concerned that nuclear waste encased in cement and concrete has been dumped there during the past 30 years. That is a time bomb for future generations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When action was called for and questions asked in the House of Commons as to what had been going on during the past 30 years, truthful answers were not given. The Department responsible dodged, ducked, weaved and dived. The Labour Government should be more open and honest and find out what is in the Beaufort dyke, to determine what problems are posed for the Irish sea and future generations in all the countries that surround it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem involves the dumping not only of nuclear waste but of armaments and munitions from the first and second world wars. Some flat fish around Irish sea coasts contain 10 times the permitted levels of arsenic. People eat those fish. There is a cancer in the ecosystem of that sea, and we must get to the root cause of it. The problem is not just one of the dumping of munitions and nuclear waste in the Beaufort dyke; Sellafield has its part to play in pumping out tonnes of nuclear waste for many years. It is no wonder that the Irish sea is the most radioactive sea in the world—more active than the Mururoa atoll at the time of atomic testing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are faced not only with those problems but with the additional problem of sludge dumping. Sludge from Merseyside and the Liverpool docks has been dumped during the past 15 years. Under Government
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
permit, 90,000 tonnes of sewage mixed with heavy metals has been dumped in Liverpool bay. It must be borne in mind that my home town, Rhyl, depends on tourism for its livelihood, as do other towns, such as Blackpool, Colwyn Bay and Llandudno.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to sludge dumping, there is chemical and industrial pollution along the River Mersey. There were 859 leakages in 1992 alone, pollutants from which flushed down into Liverpool bay and on into the Irish sea. There is a problem with fertilisers, which are strewn on the land in Northern Ireland, southern Ireland, north Wales, north-west England and southern Scotland; they leach into rivers and on into the Irish sea. As a consequence, our inland waterways and rivers are choked with poisonous algae, and each year, in May and June, a brown raft of glutinous slime produces a cabbagey smell along the north Wales coast. So problem on problem affects the Irish sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now deal with an issue which is dear to my heart—sewage pollution. Welsh Water has made valiant efforts to improve the problem of sewage being pumped into the Irish sea. More than any other water company in the United Kingdom, it has provided preliminary, primary, secondary and tertiary treatment of sewage, but its record is still not good enough. I am urging my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to take up the challenge to ensure that all Welsh sewage works have ultraviolet treatment plants by 2005. I suggest that we concentrate in the first instance on those tourist towns such as Rhyl, Colwyn Bay and Llandudno, which depend on clean seas for their business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, we need a convention on the Irish sea to consider how to deal with the industrial chemical cocktails that have been pumped into the sea for decades. At present, it is the responsibility of several organisations, including the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the environmental agency and local councils. They all have detailed information about that pollution, but it is kept separate and locked away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ireland has a Department of the Marine, which considers the interplay of those pollutants. We need something similar to consider those problems, so that we do not suffer the environmental degradation, the economic effects and, more important, the health hazards that affect the population of north Wales and surrounding areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Jones. I am glad of the opportunity to say a few words in Mold—Daniel Owen's town. Daniel Owen was a genius of a novelist, who gave us a rich picture of Welsh life in the 19th century. No one can understand 19th century Wales, nor 20th century Wales, who has not read his books. He was ahead of his time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Life in a market town with a mining background forms the background to Daniel Owen's novels. One of his main characters, Mari Lewis, is critical of farmers; but in "Gwen Tomos", his third novel, his description of the heroine and of Elin Wyn
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1130">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
Pantybuarth and her remarkable father, Robert Wyn Pantybuarth, shows an appreciation of the wonderful quality of 19th-century country life, as well as of its hardship and sadness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speak as one who has a great respect for farmers. They are not always easy to deal with, but I feel kindly towards them and respectful of them. They show enterprise and determination and have a remarkable ability to adapt to changes. A strong feeling of brotherhood and sisterhood exists among them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not need to emphasise the enormous importance of farmers to the economy of Wales. They must occupy a central role in any strategy for reviving the economy and the quality of life for our country. Every farm and every family lost from the world of agriculture is a great loss to the vitality and strength of our country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One feels very sad these days about the current crisis in agriculture, expecially in those sectors that are crucial to Wales. As well as the problem of beef, which needs no mention today, we have the free market in milk production, which is driving small and medium-sized farmers out of the industry. There is a strong feeling among farmers that Milk Marque has betrayed them. That is a problem not only for those who are leaving farming but for the milk industry in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many are worried that the supermarkets are increasingly buying direct from farmers and, by so doing, are favouring the larger farms close to the big urban centres. That could have a grave effect on the Welsh countryside, because of the close association between agriculture and rural areas. I set out some of those concerns in a letter to the hon. Member for Bridgend—I stress the word "honourable"—and I look forward to his response. Representatives of the National Farmers Union and the Farmers Union of Wales have also written to the hon. Gentleman and they expect replies. The current crisis means that there is great interest in the prospects for reform of the common agricultural policy.

Some people are concerned with issues of international trade, which means that reform is inevitable and the sooner the better. It is essential that reform is carried out properly and that the needs of Wales are protected are safeguarded. That has not happened in the past. The present pattern of agricultural support has failed to maintain the income of Welsh farmers or to protect the farm structure in Wales. Agricultural income in Wales went down by 40 per cent. between 1979 and 1991, compared with a drop of 30 per cent. in the rest of the United Kingdom. Therefore, Wales suffered far more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a general belief that farming in Wales is heavily subsidised, but the level of subsidy in Wales is £53 per hectare less than in England. Wales is not well represented or featherbedded compared with England. There are plenty of examples of Wales being badly represented under the common agricultural policy. In 1984, when milk protection quotas were introduced, Welsh interests were not protected, even though there was an opportunity to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
The Government have refused to implement the retirement pension scheme and a scheme to assist young farmers, on the grounds that British farms are large enough to support two generations. That may be true of England, but not Wales. The British Government killed off the MacSharry project aimed at protecting small dairy herds, and we are seeing the effects of that. The Governemt blocked the MacSharry proposal to phase out compensation to large cereal farmers. People have grown fat on growth, high compensation and high prices in the world market. At the same time, Welsh cereal farmers receive lower compensation per hectare than English growers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Agriculture and the countryside in Wales have suffered considerable damage as a result. It is no wonder that Gillian Bristow of the Cardiff business school, who has written well on this issue, says that agricultural support has been less efficient in Wales than in the United Kingdom as a whole and that Wales has suffered a greater degree of policy failure than the rest of Britain. With the reform of the CAP being inevitable, the question is how to ensure that the benefits for Wales will be safeguarded; and who will be responsible for that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is considerable agreement about what the elements of a reformed CAP should be—decoupling, environmental payments, integration of agricultural policy and rural development. There is also some disagreement, particularly on the question of modulation—referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Caernarfon—which means targeting our support on smaller farms or according to the number of labour units on a farm. Vested interests in England oppose that, which is natural because it would mean redistributing resources towards Wales as well as to some of the English regions; however, it would be highly beneficial, giving great economic, cultural, social and environmental advantages to Wales. It would be an effective instrument for regional development and would also benefit parts of England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that happened the barley and wheat barons would squeal—well, let them squeal. My fear is that their fingerprints will remain on parts of the Secretary of State's brief—and they need to be erased. Welsh agriculture speaks with a different voice; I refer to the Farmers Union of Wales, which is in favour of modulation, as are elements of the NFU. It is the duty of the Secretary of State to reflect and to promote that view vigorously. The future of rural Wales is in the balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we had a Parliament that had the welfare of Wales as its priority and a civil service that prepared briefs and developed policy according to our priorities, we would not have to worry about the definition or advocacy of the Welsh perspective in the European context. May the day when we have that Parliament come soon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

council, our hosts here today. It is a strange feeling to be back here so soon, after having worked so hard to leave it, but none the less it is a great pleasure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike my predecessor in Clwyd, West, I believe strongly in the value of local government and I recognise the work done not only by elected local councillors but by their officers and workers throughout Wales. I agree with the Welsh Local Government Association that the proposed elected Assembly should not take on the powers that quangos removed from local councils. That is why I welcome the Government's proposal that the Assembly should be under a statutory duty to ensure that Wales has a vibrant and powerful system of elected local government. The Assembly will have more than enough work to do, on all levels in Wales and on an all-Wales level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Oddly enough, this is the first time—as has already been said—that the House or any of its Committees has allowed the use of the Welsh language in their meetings. I welcome the Government's commitment to ensuring that Welsh and English will be given equal status in the workings of the proposed Assembly. In that context, the Welsh language perhaps conveys more accurately the purpose behind the Welsh Assembly—"decentralisation" is the literal meaning of the Welsh word "datgonali", and that is what we are about. The process of administrative decentralisation has been going on in Wales for more than 30 years. We have in mind a reasonable and moderate Bill to improve the system and bring it under democratic control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today is an important day in the history of north Wales; we have already heard that this is the first time that the Welsh Grand Committee has met in Daniel Owen's town—I am glad to be one of its residents—which is a clear indication that the Government recognises the special position of north Wales. I welcome their commitment that the Assembly will take account of regional differences in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Wales will be offered an historic opportunity through the referendum. It is high time that we revived the relationship between Westminster and the countries and regions of the United Kingdom. Economic and social growth depend on a more decentralised structure of government. As you know, Mr. Jones, the motto behind you is that of the county of Flintshire: "Gorau Tarian Cyfiawnder", which means "Justice is the Greatest Shield". The Government's proposals are eminently just and reasonable. I am sure that they will command the support of the people of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall confine my remarks to two matters that have arisen during today's debate. First, however, I congratulate you, Mr. Jones, on chairing this historic meeting, which is so close to your home town and your constituency. It must be a tremendous pleasure and a privilege for you to chair the Committee here in Mold—and very well you have chaired it. I do not say that because you have just called me to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
In the context of the special features of today's sitting, it would not go amiss to pay tribute to the Officers of the House and to the 
	<i>Hansard</i> reporters and the translators, who are participating in the first experiment for at least 550 years. The mother of Parliaments began as a bilingual or even trilingual Parliament. From 1200 to about 1450 I believe that speeches could be made in either French or English and that the Clerks, who recorded the proceedings, wrote in Latin. Today's proceedings are less complicated than that. Nevertheless, we are all taking part in an experiment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are coming to the close of the day's business; my verdict is that it has been a great success. I hope that it goes from strength to strength. I do not say that we should return to a trilingual Assembly. I doubt whether the 
	<i>Hansard</i> reporters or the Clerks would want to record our proceedings in Latin, but today's bilingual meeting of the Welsh Grand Committee has been a tremendous success. I thank everyone involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the proper content of my speech. The Secretary of State spoke about the use of the private finance initiative. I noted what he said about the projects that would proceed to the next stage, subject to necessary changes in the law that will give guarantees to the bankers—who will fund the private finance schemes in Chepstow and so on—and their lawyers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A curiosity of the private finance initiative is that it arose in some ways from ideas generated by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he was shadow transport spokesman eight or nine years ago. In other ways, the PFI derives from the ideas of the now departed Michael Portillo. Given a choice of the two interpretations offered by my right hon. Friend and Mr. Portillo, one must consider PFI carefully to see whether we are using the Prescottisation or privatisation version.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can see the attraction in stretching the state's borrowing capacity so that more facilities can be made available for the public sector by creative use of the private sector. That is part of the Government's programme and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has listed some schemes. However, we should flag up some issues today, including the Chepstow scheme, which involves selling a lot of land to reduce the private sector's risk. The scheme involves selling spare land from two hospitals to get one new hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the land involved is surplus, that is fine. But if the two older hospitals that might be closed down so that land could be sold to a private developer or consortium were at, say, Upper Cymsgwt or wherever, in the heads of the valleys, where the capital value of land is not great, the private sector might not be willing to buy the land and build houses to reduce risks. If that difficulty is not resolved, we will have lots of nice new PFI schemes in more salubrious areas where there are active property markets in executive housing, but no possibility of funding schemes in areas with no such market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1132">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
We could look at this problem in another way by saying that whatever small amount was available for standard public sector capital schemes would therefore go to the heads of the valleys or rural areas. In that way, we could concentrate state resources as state capital spending of last resort in areas where the private sector would not invest. One can see dangers in all this, and I hope that the Minister who winds up will give us some reassurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other danger that we must consider is whether the PFI would change the fundamental nature of the national health service. If a private consortium will own a cottage hospital or other facility for 10, 20, 30 or 40 years, one has to ask: exactly what is the function of a national health service trust? In effect, the Secretary of State and his health Minister would allocate money to a health athority, based on its area's population, and the athority would buy services from a trust that was in turn buying services from the PFI consortium. There would be one too many players in the game, which would make the health service unduly complicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be suggested that the trust could be removed altogether so that the authority could purchase services directly from the PFI consortium. I do not think that that would be acceptable; but there would be too many transactions if the Welsh Office bought from a health authority which bought from a trust which bought from a PFI consortium. Every time that was done, 5 per cent. of the money would be lost in natural transaction costs that go with having all those bodies' overheads. Perhaps the Government could give us some idea of how they see the PFI being used. Does it overcomplicate the provision of health services? Does it pass too much control to whoever runs the PFI consortium?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are determined to use the PFI route to reduce state capital spending and the public sector borrowing requirement. We shall probably hear more in a couple of days from my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer about how that will affect the PSBR and what percentage of borrowing the British state undertakes. We may also hear more when the Government's PFI Bill is debated in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One does not want hospitals or other capital schemes to appear on the state's books—the basic principle of the PFI is to get such schemes off the state's books and on to someone else's books—but the problem is that no one else wants them on their books either. The last thing that big capital builders—we earlier discussed the P and 0 consortium and Bovis, which is heavily involved in PFI schemes—want is to have such schemes on their books. They want to build a hospital, for example, to get paid for it and to build another hospital. They do not want to hold an asset such as a hospital on their books or to make interest payments to a bank; they want to be paid and to move on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The state wants to make payments but to avoid the matters that I described. Once assets are taken off the state's books, whose books are they on? They will not
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
go on builders' books or on bankers' books—banks want to be in a loan transaction; they do not want an equity ownership. Who will be the equity owners of the assets that the state no longer wants to own? Answers must eventually be given to those questions, and any indications that may be given today would be very useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the Welsh economy, we have quite rightly heard many times today that the gross domestic product in Wales is 17 per cent. below the United Kingdom's average. That is fundamental to our debate. In this Committee we are, as it were, the 83 per cent. club: we all represent constituencies which, when put together, have a large prosperity deficit vis-à-vis the rest of the United Kingdom. We must concentrate our efforts on that problem, and I hope that the Welsh Assembly will eventually do so too—its first and primary job must be to reduce that prosperity deficit. That is one of the main reasons for setting up a more directly democratic body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to take issue with a Committee member who is no longer here, so I shall have to tell him about my comments later. Reference was made to the enormously important Eurofreight terminal, which will serve south and mid-Wales. I hope that when the Minister winds up he will tell us when the terminal will be built. It should be sited half way between Cardiff and Newport at the Wentloog site rather than east of Newport. I am stongly in favour of the Wentloog development. A consortium has been set up between Cardiff county council and its various private sector partners. The Welsh Development Agency undertook, on instruction from the Secretary of State, massive research to test the market for the Eurofreight terminal and to assess funding. It also investigated how freight might be grouped into container loads, broken down and distributed to the various factories, premises and warehouses in mid and south Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any comments that the Minister makes on that matter would be very useful. The teminal should get off the ground as soon as possible. If it does not it would be a classic reason why the 17 per cent. prosperity gap between us and the rest of the United Kingdom still remains. The sooner the terminal is built, the sooner we can start closing the prosperity gap.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very pleased to be a member of the Committee on such a historic day for our nation. It is also the first time that I have served on the Committee. I congratulate you, Mr. Jones, on your promotion to your highly respected postion, and I wish you well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also very pleased to be able to speak in my mother tongue. Those members of the Committee who listened to my maiden speech in the House of Commons will recall that I said that it was easier to describe feelings in one's mother tongue. Here, in Mold, we are grateful to have that opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the three wise men on the Front Bench who are here to answer questions on the Government's behalf. I realise that they are in the hot seat here in the north today. I welcome some of the announcements
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1133">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has already made before today. I refer specifically to the fact that he and his Ministers feel that the north-west of Wales has not received due attention with regard to fair investment. A week ago we all had an opportunity to have our say on that matter on the Floor of the House. It will not surprise the Committee, however, if I raise the subject of problems in my constituency. So-called investment has come to the Conwy constituency but, over a period of three years, has created only 18 posts. I am sure that all members of the Committee—indeed, everyone in Wales—will agree that that is not a fair investment in a constituency where many young people are unemployed—a quarter of our young people have been out of work for far too long. Because of that, my constituents welcomed the announcement before the election and subsequent announcements by the Labour Government that genuine posts will be created for young people and others who are long-term unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legacy of 18 years' extremist Tory Government has caused problems in the Conwy constituency and other constituencies. As I said in the House a week ago, north-west Wales has suffered because of a lack of investment. The slate-quarrying industry, for example, was gradually run down, with people dribbling on to the dole. In other places in Britain, it often happened that factories employing 1,000 or so people would suddenly close down, resulting in an immediate investment to overcome and cope with immediate problems. We have suffered in north-west Wales because a gradual decline caused employment to haemorrhage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to another matter of much importance to me in Conwy and to you, Mr. Jones—that of health. I hope that those on the Front Bench will give detailed attention to the question of community health councils and that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will give a statement on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CHCs were created in 1974 to safeguard the consumer—the user—of the health service. The past four years have seen their erosion. Will the Goverment re-examine that matter so that we can stop that once and for all? The councils are important because they can investigate the problems of patients in our country. For example, a 70-year-old man had to be moved more than 70 miles to a hospital near Crewe from North Wales hospital's intensive care unit—even though he was barely conscious and on a drip—because of a shortage of beds in that unit. That illustrates how health trusts have not acted efficiently. We cannot wait for the Government to see benefits coming to our constituencies. It is high time that uncalled-for bureaucracy was done away with so that the family of that gentleman from Gwynedd and others like them do not have to suffer again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I also mention what has happened at the cancer unit at ysbyty Gwynedd? The hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) raised that issue this morning. I am concerned that patients and their families in north Wales are being used as a political football, as has happened to patients in my area recently. I have been able to raise that matter with my
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I am pleased about the announcement that that unit will proceed. I have totally failed, however, to receive a definite promise from the people managing the service that there has been a commitment to let the unit proceed. Some £1.25 million has been raised by volunteers in Gwynedd to build that unit. In the election campaign it was suggested that that project would be shelved indefinitely. That is what I mean when I say that patients and their families in north Wales are being used as a political football.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude with the question of the ambulance service. I have received information to the effect that there are numerous problems with the ambulance service in north Wales. That information has not yet been put in the public domain but I hope to raise the matter with the Under-Secretary as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While referring to transport I am trying not to repeat what has already been said by other hon. Members. The policies that we put to the Welsh electorate before the election are now ready to be implemented, so we shall be able to see less suffering among old people. Some have said that they want an improved train service along the north Wales coast. Last Thursday I should have arrived at Bangor at about 11 o'clock but I arrived at quarter to one in the morning, which was no joke after being in London for a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sooner we can get something done about education, health and public transport, the better for the constituents who have elected me to come here and to London to fight for them. Thank you, Mr. Jones, for the opportunity to speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: What a joy to hear the beautiful Welsh spoken by those who have had the great privilege of speaking it from the cradle. I shall not inflict on the Committee my Grangetown dialect of the Welsh language, which is rarely heard, but I shall do so on another occasion. The campaign, with which many people have been involved, was initiated by the Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley). It has taken many courses, including a number of occasions when I have addressed the House in the middle English of Geoffrey Chaucer, which is incomprehensible to almost everyone, probably including Geoffrey Chaucer, when it is pronounced by me. That is permissible in the House because it is English, not Anglo-Saxon or Norman French. One of the idiocies of procedure in the House is that it is a one-language institution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
P and O is receiving a good press today, but I once gave a quotation of enormous length in the House from Caesar's "The Gallic Wars" during a debate on what were known as roll on, roll over ferries and their dangers. I gave an example of Julius Caesar who, 50 years before the birth of Christ, brought 800 boats across the Channel and took them back without losing a single vessel. Julius Caesar had a better record than P and 0 for cross-channel safety. I quoted from book

	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
IV of "The Gallic Wars" because the Speaker, who was not as active as many and may have been dozing at the time, allowed me to continue at length. Both languages have been used and the events today have been perfectly natural. It is artificial to speak in one language rather than two when it is normal at such events to speak in two languages. This has been a first step, which can now be refined and brought to Westminster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to a scandalous situation that has affected some of my constituents. They are being preyed on by one of the bottom feeders of the mortgage business—a man whom I would cheerfully call a crook, Mr. David Steene. He has sent 4 million leaflets to council tenants trying to persuade them to buy their council houses. He has an atrocious record of persuading people who cannot afford mortgages to produce false details of their income. He charges them 2 per cent. above the interest rate and if they miss a payment he then doubles the interest rate. His purpose is to impoverish his. customers and to drive them to having to sell their houses to him. He repossesses the houses and then profits by selling them.

I have never been an especially strong advocate of the Welsh Grand Committee because it has often fallen foul of the tribal politics that take place at Westminster, but the Secretary of State made it clear that he wanted this to be a fresh start—so far, so good. Today's debates have been refreshing in their content, which augurs well. I believe that the historic decision to come to Mold was the right one, and I hope that the

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like briefly to mention one reason why it is important for the workings of Parliament to come closer to the people. One of the worrying aspects of the general election was the fact that fewer young people voted than have voted for many generations. All of us involved in democratic and constitutional politics recognise that we have a part to play in addressing the feeling of alienation among young people. In the Welsh Grand Committee, other workings of Government and the elected body that, hopefully, will be established in Wales, it is vital that we go to all parts of Wales to explain what we are about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must stress the point made by the hon. Member for Monmouth: any elected body for Wales must be elected by a form of proportional representation. It is vital that people in Wales recognise that such a body represents us all, whatever our political opinions and whichever part of Wales we come from. I also believe that proportional representation should be on the agenda for the European elections. I hope that that will form part of the Government's programme in the next year so that that objective can be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to touch briefly on two points raised by the Secretary of State when he was dealing with the question of rail. First, he recognised the importance of developing the north-Wales railway line. I know that many hon. Members in north Wales welcome that, and I hope that the Secretary of State will carefully consider the studies that have been undertaken in order to improve the north-Wales line, not only for passengers, but for freight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, on the roads programme, I welcome the Government's commitment to the the A5-A55 improvements but I hope that it will be possible to start that programme before autumn 1998. I have stood outside schools on the A5 in Anglesey at 10 minutes to nine in the morning and there is a tremendous feeling of unease when children cross the road. I hope that the Secretary of State and his colleagues will consider carefully whether it is possible to bring that date forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I should like to thank Flintshire county council for the hospitality that we have enjoyed. In the spirit of co-operation, it is a privilege to be working with another party—Plaid Cymru—as the Opposition here. Usually there is an enormous set-to at this point, when everyone tears each other to bits. I am not going to do that as we have had a constructive debate. Coming to Mold reminds me that Lloyd George once took his Cabinet to Inverness, and we expect no less from the Secretary of State than that we will go to Pontrydyfen, Llanwrtyd and Bethesda.

Today's debate has concentrated rightly on democracy, which is fundamental to the future of Wales; on the poverty that we have to banish; on the economic regeneration that will pull us up by the bootstraps into the better times of the 21st century; on the education which is the key to ensuring that the schools available to our young people will meet those challenges; and on the national health service that can keep everyone healthy if there if sufficient investment in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget is very important and I am sure that the Secretary of State and his colleagues will have been consulted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who will announce his plans on Wednesday. It is a pity that the new Labour Government's aspirations are not matched absolutely with sufficient funding. Perhaps the Chancellor has a few wild cards up his sleeve and will produce money from somewhere. We know that it will not come from income tax. The Liberal Democrats would have upped income tax to put £100 million more into education in Wales alone—and I know that Plaid Cymru had similar plans. We could have put another £27 million into the NHS by putting tax up on cigarettes. Indeed, we could have tackled the great poverty problem in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wales has been a quango state and has been badly abused. All of us here would agree with that. That quango state needs to be dismantled. It has paid out 40 per cent. of Welsh Office expenditure, and NHS trusts, national parks and other bodies have been stuffed with the previous Government's placemen. I am sure that the new Government will sort that out equitably and will ensure that fairness will rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must replace that state with a meaningful senedd. The Secretary of State, in the spirit of cooperation and inclusiveness, covered a great deal of ground on that. His initiation of use of the Welsh language for the first time in 500 years of parliamentary proceedings is truly excellent. I do not know whether the absence of the Conservative party will be redressed in future but I found it extraordinary to hear the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) opposing proportional representation on the radio this morning.

The Secretary of State's holistic approach to departmental responsibilities and the allocation of functions to Ministers was interesting and constructive. I would say only that he has heard today from rural Members that we feel—and this is not to devalue the role of the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths)—that we would like a Minister for rural affairs and agriculture in Wales who could concentrate totally on those affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan) put his finger on an important point in his erudite discussion of the private finance initiative. We do not feel that that is necessarily going to be the answer to all our prayers about, for example, the NHS. There are problems, but I welcome the announcement about the PFI initiative relating to Bronllys, which is in my constituency. Undoubtedly, the Chancellor used that as a sleight of hand in relation to public finances, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
certain Conservative Chancellors have used it to overcome other problems. Judging by the time that some PFI initiatives have taken, the delay must have saved the public purse much money. That matter should be looked at very carefully indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Caernarfon rightly stated that we have to unite Wales—north, south, east, west and mid Wales. We must ensure that the Parliament is capable of doing things—not just talking about them. It should be capable of raising taxes and should be elected by a proper system of proportional representation. The hon. Member for Monmouth said that he was in favour of PR, but I remind him that under the Government's present proposals, half the Members will be voted in by a first-past-the-post system, which we do not regard as wholly fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of poverty, whether in urban coalfield areas or in other parts of urban Wales, is severe. Rural poverty has also been an enormous problem for many of us who represent those areas; there is no doubt that there is also hidden poverty in rural Wales. People who do not own cars in certain areas just do not get around any more. Pensioners are often stuck in homes in very isolated places and young people have to emigrate from rural Wales to find a decent job. Such problems, which have afflicted Wales for a long time, must be overcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The speech of the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Dafis) about agriculture was an invaluable contribution to our debate. As he said, farm incomes are extremely low at present and what is required in common agricultural policy reform is a genuine reform of the green currency. It is extraordinary that there is compensation available from the European Union which can be match funded, but the Government have not taken up that route yet—I give them the benefit of the doubt. People whose new premiums will be almost halved in value in the next 12 months will be extremely badly off by the time 1998 arrives. I am sure that not many people would like the income from their main enterprise, whatever their business, to be halved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not discussed the importance for rural areas of retaining the Development Board for Rural Wales, which is very important. Certainly, my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr Öpik) and I, along with other Members representing mid-Wales, think that it has done an enormously good job in bringing investment into rural Wales. It is now assisting indigenous industry to grow in economic strength.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter that has not been mentioned is the importance—I cannot stress it enough—of the fact that the objective 5B initiative for rural areas can continue after 1999. Given that the gross domestic product per person in Wales is now only 83 per cent. of that in the rest of the United Kingdom, some rural areas of Wales should qualify for objective 1 funding; that should be looked at carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many issues have been raised here today. I cannot mention all of them, but I thought that the hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson)—we are in his constituency—rightly mentioned the problem of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1136">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
youth unemployment, as did the hon. Member for Conwy (Mrs. Williams). That is a huge problem in both urban and rural Wales. It means that there is a lack of opportunity and, unless we can sort out education and training, a lack of skills to meet the challenges of industry into the 21st centry, when a highly skilled work force will be required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Neath, is well aware that training for skilled employment will be increasingly important. That requires investment, and I hope that the Government will find the necessary money to ensure that that occurs. Let us hope that in five years' time youth unemployment will not be 25 per cent., as it is in some of our communities. We must end that tragic waste of human resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Delyn also mentioned the importance of introducing a minimum wage. I agree with him that a minimum wage is vital in the low-pay economy in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Assembly will not solve all those problems, but it will point us in the right direction by concentrating our thoughts and, I hope, our actions on ensuring that the members of the Assembly are more responsive to the needs of Wales. I hope that not too many powers will be taken away from local government. Its powers must be increased, not concentrated in the Assembly in Cardiff. Real power should reside in the community so that people can influence their own environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd (Mr. Ruane), who represents Dyffryn Clwyd, made an important speech on the problems of pollution in the Irish sea. That enormous problem must be overcome. During my lifetime, I have seen the quality of the water in Cardigan bay deteriorate more or less before my eyes. A huge job remains to be done. It is an international problem as much as one for Wales, and the European Union must direct its attentions to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am proud of my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire, who gave an excellent account of himself, especially when mentioning the importance of transport. I know that he has a personal interest in aviation, which could revolutionise communications in Wales given the state of some of the infrastructure of mid-Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here today we have experienced a feeling of hope and anticipation for Wales. Unfortunately, the Committee can take no real decisions. Let us hope that in due course we shall have a senedd that can. The next generation is relying on us, today and in the next five years, to bring real democracy for Wales—together with real educational opportunities and real, decently paid jobs—and to see to it that our citizens live in good health. It is our duty to ensure that we do not disappoint them. I am sure that the Secretary of State's intention accords with what I have said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Win Griffiths)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to wind up at the end of an excellent debate in which hon. Members
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
put their views constructively, and in doing so contributed to the Labour Government's tackling of the problems that have been graphically described here. The importance and priority that we shall give to those matters is emphasised by our meeting in Mold. This is an historic occasion. We are in the process of giving the governance of Wales to Wales and of establishing stronger and more effective partnerships with all tiers of government and with those who are involved with improving the economy of Wales and the quality of life of its people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We intend to transform the way in which Wales is governed by establishing an Assembly for Wales. I welcomed the comments of the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) when he announced in these formal surroundings that Plaid Cymru intended to work positively with the Government. We look forward to such co-operation and communication as crucial elements in the project of making Wales a place where people will have a voice in the new Assembly. I am also pleased that the hon. Members for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Opik) and for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Livsey) agreed on some aspects of policy in such a way as to suggest support for the Government's intention to create an Assembly that will be the voice of Wales. The co-operation that has been given this afternoon shows how effective democracy can be when hon. Members enter willingly—despite policy differences—into an important project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank all those who have made today's meeting such a great and welcoming occasion. Flintshire county council has welcomed us to its headquarters. Officials of Parliament have ensured that our proceedings are efficiently run. I pay tribute to the police and the fire service, for ensuring that our break outside during the bomb scare was short—welcome though some fresh air may have been. I pay tribute also to those Welsh Office officials who have been looking after Ministers today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The success of today's occasion is reflected in the contributions made by hon. Members. I pay particular tribute to those new hon. Members who may already have made maiden speeches in the House but who today made maiden speeches in the Welsh Grand Committee: my hon. Friends the Members for Cardiff, North (Ms Morgan), for Vale of Clwyd, (Mr. Ruane), for Clwyd, West (Mr. Thomas) and for Monmouth, (Mr. Edwards), and the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire. I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth would regard this as a second debut, so to speak. All hon. Members, and especially those new hon. Members whom I have mentioned, have played a constructive and positive role in our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had what can only be described as a very wide-ranging debate, so I shall try to deal with general policy areas rather than pick up on individual speeches. I shall try to answer the questions raised as I go along, but if I miss some of them, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, my fellow Under-Secretary and I will ensure that a reply is given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1137">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
I shall start with education, because that is a Government priority. We intend to ensure that, at the end of the Labour Government's first term, the education of young people is in a far better state than it is today. The hon. Member for Caernarfon made a straighforward plea for more money, but he will be aware of the difficulties we have in providing that immediately because of the manifesto commitments that we have to meet. The hon. Gentleman must however, also be aware that the Prime Minister made it very clear that he expected that, at the end of the Labour Government's first term, a greater share of national wealth would be invested in education than is the case today. The only difference between the hon. Gentleman and the Government relates to the speed with which we can move to deal with these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) highlighted the problems of Coleg Meirion-Dwyfor and asked questions about the efficiency and effectiveness of TECs and their contribution to training. Although he acknowledged that different partnerships are involved at post-16 level and that different problems need to be tackled, the fundamental problem with Coleg Meirion-Dwyfor rests between it and the Further Education Funding Council for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are sympathetic to the problems that the hon. Gentleman raised, and the formula used by the Further Education Funding Council for Wales already takes better account of sparsity than is the case in England. Nevertheless, I assure the hon. Gentleman that we shall look at the problem, and my fellow Under-Secretary has already announced his intention to set up an action group on further education and training in Wales. That important body will look to tackle such problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of class sizes was raised by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire and by my hon. Friends the Members for Monmouth and for Vale of Clwyd. Again, they will all know that we are committed to tackling the problem by starting with five, six and seven-year-olds. It is important to start with that age group, because all the evidence shows that if children are taught in small classes at that age, they will be better able to cope should there be any class-size problems further up the system. Of course, we hope that over time we will be able to tackle problems throughout the education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth referred to Gwent further education college. Once again, we are aware of the problems and, as my hon. Friend said, my fellow Under-Secretary has taken a personal interest in the issues. He will want to ensure that the problems are duly tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education is the foundation on which not only the well-being of people as citizens, but the well-being of the nation and its prosperity will depend. That brings me to the economy and to the maiden speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Ms Morgan). It was a short but telling contribution that concentrated on the issue of skills and on the fact that, particularly in south Wales—I am sure in north Wales, too—there will be a need for more people in
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
engineering as we see the benefits of a growing economy. To fill that gap, we need to develop more opportunities for women who traditionally have not worked in the engineering sector. Responsibilities have been placed on TECs to ensure that they create training programmes to give women skills in sectors where they traditionally have not had them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was grateful for my hon. Friend's acknowledgment of the steps that have already been taken in child care to look at ways of bringing the different grant schemes together to make it easier for that money to be used. We also want to develop a strategy to tackle the problem that she described whereby the families most in need of child care are prevented by the current funding regimes from obtaining it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Caernarfon talked about issues related to fibre optic links. Again, I know that my fellow Under-Secretary is looking at those issues—and, indeed, made commitments in an Adjournment debate in the House a short while ago. Progress is being made. It is important that we provide a network right across Wales so that benefits can run from the south-east and north-east into mid-Wales and the south-west and north-west.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will take a close look at Plaid Cymru's economic strategy. If there is anything that we can mobilise to the advantage of Wales, we will do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South (Mr. Jones) talked about jobs and the role of the WDA. We are seeking in the creation of the Assembly to have ready a Welsh economic powerhouse which will specifically target the areas of Wales that have not had the success enjoyed by other parts. We must get the spread right across the whole of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North emphasised the need to tackle the wealth gap. We believe that by creating an Assembly that can focus on the needs of Wales we will be able to do that. The economic powerhouse will play its part in getting the right sort of jobs by improving the skills of the Welsh labour force. I look forward to asking it to tackle what has been a fundamental problem for the Welsh economy since the savage decline of our traditional industries. The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire and my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn both mentioned the minimum wage. Our commitments on that are clear. We will certainly make sure that there will be a strong Welsh interest in the minimum wage of commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to health. The hon. Member for Caernarfon talked about national health service priorities. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire mentioned cottage hospitals, the two-tier system and the ambulance service. My hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth talked about the status of mental health services and was particularly concerned about the dropping of the Red Barn project. My hon. Friend the Member for Conwy (Mrs. Williams) talked about community health councils, the importance of ITU units and the difficulties at ysbyty Gwynedd. Several hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West raised issues relating to the PFI.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1138">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
We have already begun to tackle some of those problems. We have written to the NHS trusts in Wales. We also intend to consult, throughout the NHS in Wales, on providing a more effective service, getting the trusts reconfigured so that a better service can be provided and so that any savings in administration can be put back directly into providing services for patients. In the case of cottage hospitals, I am pleased that the Dyfed-Powys health authority with all its problems, withdrew its original plans. We are still awaiting a final proposal from it before we can look at the best way of tackling its financial problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentions the importance of community hospitals. In order to avoid any misunderstanding that there might still be among members of the North Wales health authority, will he confirm that, when he sent out the circular in May about priorities in the NHS, he did not intend it to be interpreted as giving a lower priority to community hospitals. The fact that he did not mention them specifically was surely not intended to give that message, and the North Wales health authority should not use it on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm that there was no intention to give the impression that any part of the health service was being downgraded. Some areas were of such concern to me that we had to make special efforts to ensure, for example, that hospital closures did not happen on a large scale across Wales as they did last year. Efforts are regularly made to reduce closures and we want to bring the number down to nil, if we can, in the coming winter. Yes, we need to focus on some aspects immediately, but that should not mean that other important parts of the delivery of health services should be ignored or forgotten.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of community health councils, my first public engagement was to speak to their annual general meeting, where I undertook to carry through our election manifesto commitment to look at ways of strengthening their role and powers in the health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the intensive treatment unit crisis, I have spoken to Ysbyty Gwynedd about the patient who was moved. It has assured me that it has revised its policy and that that sort of thing will not happen again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A report is coming to me in the near future on ambulance services. I want to make sure that we have an effective ambulance service in Wales, particularly as regards getting to emergency calls on time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all aware of the pluses and minuses of the private finance initiative, but we want to use it where we can do so effectively. After this meeting I shall be visiting Ruthin under the pathfinder scheme to see exactly what progress is being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of transport issues were raised. The Deputy Prime Minister has made announcements about an integrated transport policy and intends to carry that forward. Yes, let us try to put more freight on rail. The Eurofreight terminal was mentioned by the hon. Friends the Members for Monmouth and for
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan). There is a little dispute about where it might be best placed, but I assure my hon. Friends that my hon. Friend the Member for Neath is having urgent discussions about the issue and we hope to make an announcement about it in the not-too-distant future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire mentioned Welshpool airport. My hon. Friend the Member for Neath will be prepared to receive ideas about—I was going to say—putting down an international track. However, we are not talking about Nokia here—we are talking about Welshpool. I appreciate what my hon. Friend the Member for Conwy said about how frustrating it is to be stuck on a train which is not up to scratch. We would like to have been on the train on Sunday afternoon to come up to north Wales. It is impossible to get to north Wales in the evening if public transport is not there, and at the moment it is not. Therefore, we came up by car, which was the only practical way of doing it. That highlights the need for the matter to be taken further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note everything that my hon. Friends the Members for Delyn and for Clwyd, South (Mr. Jones) and the hon. Members for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley), for Ceredigion, for Montgomeryshire, and for Brecon and Radnorshire said on agricultural issues. How I would wish to be responsible only for rural affairs and the countryside and that somebody could take the national health service, social services, local government, planning, the envirvironment, housing and my ministerial responsibilities for children from me! Let me assure all members of the Committee that we want a vibrant rural economy in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that—again in the not-too-distant future—the Secretary of State will make an announcement about an agri-environment scheme to cover the whole of Wales. We are in discussions with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food about taking matters forward at the European level. I believe that hon. Members will already have seen a difference in attitude on the Commission's part now that we are trying to co-operate with it to ensure that the beef ban is lifted as quickly as possible. We want to make sure that all those things happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note the comments of the hon. Member for Caernarfon about out-of-town shopping and of my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South on planning issues. I have already said that we will take a tough stance on the planning guidance that has already been issued with respect to out-of-town shopping and development of that type. I have also written to all authorities in Wales about the need to pay careful attention to urban sprawl and perhaps to dedicate areas to green belt. That would avoid the creation of a new city in south Wales called Carport or Newdiff—one could take one's choice as to the name. Neither Cardiff nor Newport would want that to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was heartened by the contributions about the Welsh Assembly made by my hon. Friends the Members for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) and for Monmouth and the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire. There has been unanimity in all
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1139">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
speeches about the need to give the Welsh people a proper voice in the affairs of Wales—a voice that has so far been lacking. It is not acceptable that a Secretary of State—whether the present Secretary of State or a member of the present Opposition at some other time—should be able, with two or three people, effectively to decide, after consultation behind the scenes, what will happen in Wales. I am sure that a Welsh Assembly will open up the process and that Wales will be seen to be properly governed in accordance with the priorities of the people of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased to hear mention of the inclusive approach and the use of proportional representation—not the perfect form of proportional representation, but what is the perfect form? We could debate that for ever. We are trying to ensure that all parts of Wales and all parties in Wales obtain proper representation in the Welsh Assembly. There will be a voice for all those who legitimately show that they have the support of a substantial part of the Welsh population. That will be important in ensuring that the people of Wales in future have a Government who attend to their needs. The Parliament that began its life in 1997 will be a historic one for Wales because after the referendum a body will be created to meet the needs of Welsh people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
