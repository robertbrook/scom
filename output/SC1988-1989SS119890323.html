	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I am sure that I speak for the whole Committee in expressing our shock at the news of the sudden death of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. McTaggart). I am sure that all our thoughts go out to his family at this time. He was a universally popular Member and the whole Committee has been shocked by the news this morning, which many of us have learnt only in the past few moments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. I, too, should like to record my own and my party's warm feelings towards the family of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. McTaggart). That quiet and unassuming man won respect from all of us. He worked extremely hard for his constituents. Our debates this morning will perhaps acquire a sense of perspective which they do not normally have. On behalf of the Scottish National party, I send my warmest sympathy to his wife and three children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. I support the comments that have been made about a cherished colleague and comrade who has sadly died. Our thoughts this morning are with his family. On behalf of my Labour party colleagues and, I am sure, the whole Committee, I extend our condolences to Mrs. McTaggart and her three children at this particularly harrowing time. This is one issue that brings together the House of Commons and I am sure that it will have an effect on our business today. My hon. Friend was a hard-working constituency Member of Parliament. He was a loyal member of the Labour party. It is a sad, sad day for us, but it is a tragic blow for his wife and three children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the Minister, and to the hon. Members for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) and for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) for their comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>

	<div class='title'>THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT AND THE ARTICLES OF CONSTITUTION</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 54, in page 2, leave out lines 32 to 36 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(c) appointed members of such numbers as to constitute no more than 25 per cent, and no less than 20 per cent, of the board of management, who represent the local community in neither the capacity of parents or teachers.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>260</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 40, in page 2, line 32, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>'such number, greater than had the school board of co-opted members'</p></blockquote>
and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'the same number as had the school board'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This, in many ways, is a searching amendment. We all wish to know exactly what the Minister has in mind when he defines the boards of management. The amendment arose from a request that I received from Dumfries and Galloway regional council. All members of the Committee will have received that report. It is interesting that one of the elected members of Dumfries and Galloway regional council is the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro), who is one of the refusniks of this Bill. That Council was involved in implementing the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988 and experimenting in that area. My amendment seeks to clarify whom the Minister intends to appoint to the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dumfries and Galloway regional council has put forward a strong case that 25 per cent, of the board of management should be elected from the local community, and not in the capacity of parent, member of staff or appointed member. The Bill includes the provision for a parish priest to be appointed to the board. It is sensible for such a person to be appointed to the board of a denominational school. However, many schools in Scotland are non-denominational, and it would be wise to appoint a priest and a local minister in such schools because they are vital members of our community, especially of the rural community where there is a close liaison between Church and school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Grampian region there is a strong trend towards community education that covers a range of age groups from pre-school playgroups to senior citizens. We should ensure that community education groups are represented on boards of management because schools are often centres for community activities. Their involvement would ensure that the board of management took account of the wider needs of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the Grampian regional council area many adults attend secondary schools to take certificates in various subjects. That is an effective part of education in several schools in my constituency, in particular, Speyside high school. Many of those adults are not parents of children at the school, and they are not members of staff. Surely, there must be a way to ensure that that group, seeking opportunities in education, is represented on the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Major employers in the communities should also be involved on the board of management, not to represent particular sectoral interests, but because in rural communities one major employer may often provide employment opportunities for school leavers. Those employers should therefore have the opportunity to be involved in the school community and to put forward their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary argued that education authority control is to be replaced by community control. Amendments Nos. 54 and 40 seek to define what is meant by the community in the Bill and also seek to involve the community on the boards. It is strange that, unlike on school boards, parents will not be in the majority on the boards of management. The largest single group will be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0157">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>261</span>
parents, but they could be overruled by appointed members. Unless we set some form of limitation and provide a definition, difficulties may arise. The boards seem to have a very different role from that of the school boards established in the legislation passed by the House last year. I want the opportunity to explore whom the Minister has in mind when he talks about appointed members, as provided in clause 3(l)(c).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to keep my remarks brief. I was interested to read that there was speculation about the possibility of the Government looking closely at the matter of a parental majority on self-governing school boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We suspect that amendment No. 40 may not be technically as good as is required to be included in legislation. But the main thrust of the speech of the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) and of my contribution is to establish whether there is a consensus in the Committee about the concept of parental majority. Normally, in his response, the Minister would refer to our debate on school boards. At that time, we were debating a move towards self-management within the education authority sector. The Opposition were trying to establish a broad base of interest and felt that that would not best be served by a majority of parents. On reflection, we accept and acknowledge that the Government's view on that issue was correct. With hindsight, it was a reasonable move for the Government to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On self-governing school boards, the context within which the debate must take place has changed dramatically. The issue is one step removed from the education authority sector, and there are two main concerns. First, we must identify the arguments for a parental majority. Secondly, like the hon. Member for Moray, we must flag up the concerns about who constitutes the community and who would be a co-opted member of the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want the Government to consider amendment No. 40 seriously, even if they do not necessarily accept it, and to give us an idea whether the concept of a parental majority in this context is acceptable to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentlemen was opposed to a parental majority on school boards. With regard to self-governing schools, it would be helpful if he explained why he believes that the need for outside community representation is reduced in the absence of the education authority, when he believed that it was desirable in the presence of the education authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall refrain from indulging in the political exchanges that we normallly have because the occasion has been altered by events this morning. Suffice it to say that I am not over-confident about what the Government believe constitutes a representative group from the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has made a timely intervention. There are interesting comparisons between the Government's advocation of parental majorities on self-governing school boards and what is happening in independent schools. I have a host of examples, but I shall use just the one from Glenalmond schoool board in Scotland. It has the most colourful make-up of any school board, including three episcopal bishops, two episcopal presbyters and two selected from the male heirs of the Duke of Buccleugh and
	<span class='label label-info column'>262</span>
Queensberry, the Marquis of Lothian, Baron Douglas, the Earl of Home and John Gladstone. I do not for a moment detract from the qualities of the original people, but their heirs give me cause for concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> Does my hon. Friend agree that the Glenalmond board is partly balanced by the inclusion of the excellent right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Alas, the right hon. Gentlemen is not here. But clearly, a man with the significant qualities of the right hon. Gentlemen may make up for two of the male heirs of that distinguished group of egalitarians.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The serious point is that it is a business in the independent sector; it is not necessarily a forum in which parents can become involved. Our argument is that if a petition is required from parents before a ballot can be held, and a parental majority wants the school to opt out, it is logically consistent that parents should have a majority on the self-governing school boards. What constitutes the community and what constitutes co-opted members is also important. I hope to come back at a later stage, as the hon. Member for Moray suggested, with another definition of the interests that may be taken on. Opposition Members believe that education is best served by people with a direct community interest: that could range from non-teaching staff in a school to those with wider community interests, who participate in the functions and activities of the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would be concerned if, as with the results of the Education Reform Act, first governors, as they are called, had an overriding majority over the parental representatives. I do not know what that group of "first governors" would constitute in the English context, but in Scotland we would not like people to be brought in on a quasi-independent financial basis. Although such people would have established reputations in the community or in industry, they would not necessarily have empathy with the objectives of the opted-out school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An item in 
	<i>The Scotsman</i> this morning suggested that there may be differences of opinion among Conservative Members. In the spirit of glasnost, which was evident at some times in our previous sitting, we do not expect the Minister to say yes or no to the amendment this morning, but we hope that he will accept the idea of a parental majority. If he gives that concession, we shall accept it. If not, we shall vote against the amendment, on the basis that the Government have no particular interest—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Vote against his own amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry; I meant to say for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chariman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister must not give advice on procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In this case, Mr. Hogg, I accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have received representations from the Scottish Consumer Council and the Scottish Parent-Teacher Council, in which the Minister invests so much money, those bodies want parents to be in the majority on school boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall leave my argument there, and hope that the Minister will give a constructive response on the principle, which we could debate later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0158">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>263</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Brown 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brigg and Cleethorpes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is much to commend in both amendments, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will listen closely to the debate, as we are in danger of creating an inconsistency.' Membership of the school boards is clear: the Government commended, with my support, the idea that there should be a parental majority on school boards. If we do not correct the detail of the Bill, we shall have a curious anomaly. It is a little invidious to have on the school board do-gooders, and heaven knows who, who claim to represent the wider community but who represent nobody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand why the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) was brief, but I should have liked to hear the reasons behind his decision to support this excellent amendment. Even though we want to proceed in as subdued and speedy manner as possible, he did not give enough reasons to the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman will concede that we have already had two or three pages of debate. I wanted to clarify the original position on school boards, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept in good faith that it is not appropriate this morning to detain the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. The reaction of the Minister was disgraceful. There has been a sad loss. I am trying to be constructive and I think that the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) is, too. I found it unacceptable for the Minister to sneer at the points that I made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that these exchanges are helpful. The Minister reacted to the hon. Member's speech, but he is entitled to do that. I do not think that the Minister sneered, and I am careful to look for anything of that nature. It would be better if the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) continued his speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr Hogg.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important thing is to persuade my hon. Friend the Minister to consider the amendments. He is moderate and modest. The Government are right about the principles, but the two Opposition parties are right about the details. It would be a marvellous conclusion to our proceedings before we rise for the Easter recess if we could persuade the Government to be right on the detail as well as the principle. I have faith in my hon. Friend the Minister. In previous sittings he has shown his willingness to listen to the argument. He will understand why the debate has been truncated this morning, but the amendments are excellent. If the Minister feels that the amendments are technically deficient and he cannot accept them, I hope that he will come back on Report with an amendment that meets the points of the hon. Members for Fife, Central and for Moray (Mrs. Ewing).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, shall be brief and omit much of the usual political knockabout.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition argued against a parental majority on school boards because those schools are administered within the education authority system and the wider community is represented. In those schools, there is no need for parents to have a majority. However, self-administering schools will be outside the education authority and we are worried that co-opted members may not necessarily represent the wider community. For such
	<span class='label label-info column'>264</span>
schools we believe that it is the lesser of the two evils if parents have a majority on the board. That explains why we support the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue rests upon who the co-opted members are and how they are elected. On Second Reading the Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The board will include the school's headteacher, elected members drawn from the teaching staff, parents and members appointed from the local community."</p></blockquote>
When the Minister responds, perhaps he will tell us how the members from the local community will be appointed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman looks, he will find that that is in the Bill. The co-opted members will be co-opted by the teacher and parent representatives once the elections have taken place. The hon. Gentleman has still not explained to the Committee why he thought that it was wrong to have a parental majority on school boards and argued that it was necessary to have a wider community interest, but is now arguing that there should be a parental majority for self-governing schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I dealt with that when I responded to the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown). It is a different position. With the school boards, we had self-administrating schools within the education authority. When the schools are outside the education authority, how will the community interest be represented? The composition of other boards causes us to worry that they might not necessarily represent the local community. Therefore, the better of the solutions and the lesser of the two evils is to have a parental majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not answer my question. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State said that the members would be
	<br><blockquote><p>"appointed from the local community."—
	<i>[Official Report,</i> 6 March 1989; Vol. 148, c. 628.]</p></blockquote>
How will the judgments on that be made? I am keen for the Minister to take up that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, have examined the boards of various colleges. At Glenalmond, the board is made up of such people as the Most Rev. the Primus, the Right Rev. the Bishop of St. Andrews and the right hon. Lord Home. They are not very representative of the local community. Professor Smellie, a professor of biochemistry, and the right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) are also on the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the Committee proceedings on the School Boards (Scotland) Bill, one of the Opposition's arguments against a parental majority on school boards was the composition of the boards of governors of independent schools. It was argued that independent schools had other interests and that it was wrong to give parents such a large role in the affairs of the school board. How can the hon. Gentleman now use the same argument, turned on its head, to argue for a completely opposite proposition? I think that the Committee—certainly the Government—would like to hear the reasons for that. We still have not heard them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is known as debating skills. The Minister should give me time to develop my argument rather than rush in, in his usual impatient manner. I am examining the composition of various boards to see how they reflect the local community. I accept that there is not an absolute parallel with schools such as Glenalmond,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0159">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>265</span>
which do not necessarily represent the local community, but it is interesting to see who is on the board and to consider what type of people we might expect to find on other boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Glasgow academy is the old school of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) taught there. Many of my colleagues also went there. The governors include Lord Muirshiel of Kilmacolm—a former Secretary of State; Professor Sir Ferguson Anderson, who is known well to me, but not exactly representative of a wider community; and Professor D. K. Mason, who is also known to me. Of course, as always, the ubiquitous and great Lord Goold is on the board. Again, I am not sure just how representative he is of the wider local community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That raises another point, to which I shall return, and which was raised with me by a member of a board of governors. The co-opted members rarely attend the board meetings; they have other, wider interests. They turn up when told to do so on important votes and in a crisis. That is one of our worries about co-opted members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the High School of Glasgow, Sir Norman Macfarlane is the chairman. What a surprise. Again, I wonder whether he represents the wider community of Glasgow. The Secretary of State's school—George Watson's college—is not too bad because it has on its board Lothian regional councillors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->

The school attended by the Secretary of State is more progressive. Its board contains five members of Lothian regional council. It is an excellent choice of school if it includes such councillors, whom he usually commends for being great and good! We should ask the Under-Secretary to give his views on the co-option of regional councillors on boards of management. Will he encourage that? Who should be co-opted members?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sir Campbell Adamson is on the governing body of Rugby school. I looked in vain to see whether the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), was on the board of Eton, but unfortunately he has not yet risen to that. Co-opted members on those boards do not represent the local community. I accept that they have wider interests and represent a broader spectrum. But how well should co-opted members represent the local community? What are the necessary qualifications? What are the Under-Secretary's views on that? Will he give advice and instructions or will it be completely up to local members? What is his view about including a regional councillor?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My area, Bearsden, is known to you, Mr. Hogg, because you used to represent it. Councillor Bannerman, a well-known and highly respected regional councillor, is a
	<span class='label label-info column'>266</span>
member of the boards of some local schools. What about someone like him being co-opted on to a board of management? Will the Church of Scotland be represented?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Co-opted members of boards have many other interests. Boards tend to be run by two or three members and the other members who are supposed to represent the local community, attend only in a crisis. We are worried that the co-opted members of boards of management will be representative not of the local community but of special interests and that their attendance and contribution will be limited. As the lesser of two evils, parents should predominate. So I ask the Minister to consider the amendments and the points I have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The road to parental involvement in Scottish education is rocky. If we respond positively to pressure, we are sometimes overtaken by the bandwagon that we have set in motion. In the Committee considering the School Boards (Scotland) Bill, strong representations were made against a parental majority. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) is smiling benignly upon me. I suppose that he remembers what he said in that Committee:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I stress again that school councils have written to me from Dundee objecting to the concept of the parental majority acting like a dictatorship within the school board in defiance of professionals and other parties that should be represented on it. I am doubly concerned that the Minister is content to accept parental majorities that could be based on party political and other sectional interests":

	<div class='member'>Mrs Margaret Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not involved in that Committee, so I do not want to go into the details of it. Will the Minister at least explain why he has changed his position on school boards to that defined in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady cannot escape from her opposition to parental majorities at that time by saying that she was not a member of that Committee. Her position was the same as that of the hon. Member for Dundee, East. The answer to her question is that I am guilty of the backsliding and moderation that my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpe (Mr. Brown) said he was here to watch out for, and we have already heard from him in that capacity. During the passage of the School Boards (Scotland) Bill, I argued that the education authority should be involved in the key management functions affecting the school, that the school board's role could become executive, but that overall responsibility remained with the education authority, which would still be the employer. Therefore, it was appropriate that the school board, which should be the forum for the parents, should have a parental majority and that there should be provision for co-option.

When I have listened to what my hon. Friends have to say, I shall speak again, but it is curious that Opposition Members have put forward no arguments to support the view that there should be a parents majority on the boards of self-governing schools. The hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing) asked why there was no provision in this Bill for a parental majority. We listened to the arguments made at the time of the school boards Bill and defended our position on the basis of education authority involvement. But in a self-governing school, the board of management will be responsible for every aspect of the running of that school. It will be the employer and have complete control. There will be no education authority involvement. Therefore, it seemed appropriate to increase community representation and to respond to the anxieties about parental majorities on school boards and the somewhat exaggerated point made by the hon. Member for Dundee, East.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: From what my hon. Friend said, I detect that he was genuinely suspicious of the reasons behind the amendments.

We have now reached a stage in the Committee's proceedings when we have a genuine debate. The Minister is not quite sure whether he should accept the amendments.

because during the discussions on the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988 he questioned parental majority. There are arguments on both sides and I have an open mind. We drafted this Bill on the basis of what we thought would be appropriate. There was great opposition to ceiling powers during the discussions on the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988, but the Scottish Consumer Council is now pressing us to amend that Act to bring back ceiling powers, and it is also arguing for parental majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a mere seeker of truth who proceeds on the basis of argument, I am surprised that things are moving so quickly. A major criticism of the ceiling powers, about which we received hundreds of letters, was that they would put important management functions into the hands of a small group of people whose only qualification to exercise them was that they had been elected. The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) served on the Committee that discussed that legislation and he will recall that we were accused of putting management into the hands of amateurs who could not and did not want to cope. The hon. Gentleman referred then to parental dictatorship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments need to be discussed. I shall listen with interest to hon. Members and if the Committee wants us to examine this issue again, I shall try to respond sympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order, I understand that the Minister has made a point that the Opposition Front Bench will have noted. I shall, of course, call the Minister to speak again at the end of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having heard the intervention of the hon. Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown), I wonder whether I should switch sides and vote with the Government, because if he supports the amendment there must be something very wrong with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the Labour party initially opposed the parents' charter, but now supports it. That misrepresents the position. The Labour party opposes the developments to which the parents' charter could give rise. In some cities in Scotland, magnet schools have expanded at the expense of other schools which, with the drop in population, cannot provide a full six-year comprehensive subject range. That has happened in Dundee where the population of some big schools in peripheral estates has plummeted and where the population of the older academies has risen dramatically under the parents' charter. We continue to oppose that unhelpful development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We opposed school boards when they were introduced, but we are realists and understand that they will operate at the end of the year. It is important that parents, teachers and all those with a genuine commitment to education should be involved in the school boards because they will play a major role in school management. We do not support the concept of school boards, but, we must live with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party opposed the idea of parental majority during the discussions on the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988. I still believe that it will cause divisions between parents and staff, particularly in relation to the ceiling powers. A parental majority that could impose measures on a minority of staff or on a minority of community interests on a school board would be divisive and unhelpful. No one wants that. At least school boards will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V008P0I0161">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>269</span>
be controlled and funded by the education authorities and that is completely different from self-governing schools, which will be funded directly by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Removing the parental majority on the school boards could lead to undemocratic influences of controlling the business of the boards of management in self-governing schools. Under the Bill, the members of the board of management will be appointed by the residue of the old school board. Therefore, the existing parental majority on the school boards will be used to appoint those members. That will create non-elected minorities within the new board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, in a school with more than 1,500 pupils, there would be seven parent members, three staff members, a head teacher and up to sue appointed members on its board of management. Therefore, of a total of 17 members, there could be as many as seven non-elected members. Furthermore, under the Bill, when setting up the committee structure, the board of management can delegate functions to a sub-committee and appoint to it people who are not even members of the board of management. It would not be beyond the bounds of possibility to have a sub-committee with delegated functions comprising a majority of people who were not elected, but who carried out duties for the school board. The purpose of the amendments is to ask the Minister to consider the undemocratic process that could emerge as a result of clause 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not support the detail of the amendments. For example, amendment No. 54 would reduce the appointed members from three to one in a school with up to 500 pupils. That would create a parental minority on the school board. However, in the case of a school with 500 to 1,000 pupils, the amendment would reduce the number of appointed members from four to two. That would lead to parental equality on that board. Therefore, on one board there would be a parental minority, while on another, there would be parental equality. In a school with 1,000 to 1,500 pupils, there would be a parental minority, but in a school with more than 1,500 pupils there would be parental equality. The amendment is flawed because its application would not be consistent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, amendment No. 40 would lead not to parental majority, but to equality with the other representatives on the boards of management. We are not concerned with the detail of the amendments. We hope that the Minister will consider the problem that will be created by the structure of the boards of management under clause 3. It could lead to unelected people making decisive interventions in the affairs of the boards of management. That is why we want the Minister to ensure that, whatever else happens under the boards of management, only the elected members decide what action the boards take. We are concerned not only about parents, but about staff members, who should have the same right to ensure that their views are taken into account. We want to ensure that appointed members and those non-members who can be appointed to the subcommittees cannot make decisive interventions in the business of the boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, I do not support the proposal for self-governing schools, but Conservative Members will ensure that the Bill reaches the statute book, and pockets of Tory support
	<span class='label label-info column'>270</span>
throughout the country will ensure that some schools become self-governing. When that happens, we want the Minister to ensure the the boards of management are controlled democratically. As the Bill is drafted, that will not be the case. Will the Minister reconsider the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) in respect of amendment No. 40 Amendment No. 54, which was moved by the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing), was a probing amendment seeking clarification of the Government's position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 61, which I tabled, has not been selected for debate, but I am not criticising the Chair's decision. I thought that I had the wording from the Education Reform Act 1988, but I cannot find it now.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) and his hon. Friend's have been understandably brief this morning and I shall follow their example. There has been a conversion on the part of Opposition Front Bench spokesmen to the principle of parental majority. We shall not question that too much, My hon. Friend the Minister may rememeber the old saw, "Better one sinner that repenteth", and we should accept the Opposition's movement to our side. If my hon. Friend the Minister believes that there is an essential continuum between school boards and self-governing schools, he should take the principle of amendment No. 40 seriously. If he reflects on some of the criticisms that have been made by the Opposition, especially by the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. MacDonald) in his brief speech at our previous sitting, he will see that if the term "self-governing schools" is to gain the maximum support, there is a good case for moving towards the principle of amendment No. 40.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Opposition will not press the amendment to a Division, but I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will accept that some of us on the Conservative Benches, too, are in favour of the principle of amendment No. 40.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, shall be brief. As the Minister said, I spoke against unrepresentative parents on school boards. I stand by that, as we were discussing schools with, say, 1,000 pupils, meaning 2,000 parents and perhaps only seven parents on the school board. We said that that was not democratic and, in many instances, that would not be representative of the parents of the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The game is being changed completely with self-governing schools as the Secretary of State is the commissar with the aces up his sleeve. The members taken on to those self-governing schools will be appointed for five to seven years, which is longer than the elected members from the school. The case for the elected members being more representative is without question and that is the point that the amendment puts across. Our arguments are entirely consistent. The Minister should clarify the position on appointed members and those who are elected. We suggest that elected members should be nearer, however tangential that may be. That would certainly be right for those who are being appointed for up to seven years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends distinction between school boards and the boards of management of schools that have opted out is clearly fundamental. Self-governing schools will have extensive responsibility across the range of their activities and it is necessary to have people other than parents on the board. There would be merit in having a majority of co-opted members. Part of the purpose must be to mirror successful schools outside the state sector, which do not have a majority of parents on the boards of governors. Such schools have people with knowledge and experience on which the executive governors may rely and from whom they may seek advice.

I shall not give a commitment to come back, on Report, with an amendment to alter the composition of the board of management to include a parental majority, but I am happy to give the Committee an undertaking to re-examine the matter carefully. If it is possible to do so, I shall be disposed to try to meet the will of the Committee and provide for a parental majority, but I am sure that hon. Members will want me to consider the implications of such a move. If we are unable to come back on Report with a suitable amendment, I would expect to be able to give the House an explanation. At present, I am lost for words to explain why one might wish to resist the will of the Committee, but I undertake to reconsider the issue. I agree that the arguments that have been put forward, especially in regard to the consistency of schools boards, are most persuasive. I make it clear that my remarks were directed at amendment No. 40.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 54, tabled by the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs. Ewing), does not work and is rather complicated. I believe that the hon. Lady tabled it because she was worried about appointments, and I apologise to her for not having dealt with that point and will now briefly correct that omission. Whether the appointed members of the board are in large or smaller numbers as a result of these deliberations remains to be seen. However, the appointments will be made by the boards of management after the elections of the teachers' and parents' representatives have taken place and they will have complete discretion as to whom they wish to appoint. There will be no prescription that they must be regional councillors, trade unionists, business men or church men, with the exception of the denominational schools, where there is a requirement that a church nominee shall be co-opted to the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not propose to give any guidance to the boards of management as to whom they should co-opt other than recommending that they should take account of the skills and range of abilities that the democratic process has made available and consider the type of people that it would be appropriate to co-opt to make the boards well rounded. Those people might include accountants, trade unionists or even a regional councillor, who was someone the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) asked me about. Regional councillors of all political parties

work extremely hard and have extensive commitments, so they may not be the most obvious people to appoint to the boards.

	<i>Amendment proposed,</i> No. 60, in page 3, leave out lines 16 to 19 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>
	<ol>
	<li>'(1) Subject to subsection (1A) below, a parent member elected under paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section 3 of this Act, or a staff member elected under paragraph (b) of the said subsection (1), shall hold office for a term of four years.</li>

	<li>(1A) The term of office of half (or, where there is an odd number of parent members, of the largest number less than half) of the parent members when a board of management is established shall be two years.</li>

	<li>(1B) The parent members whose term of office is to be restricted to two years under subsection (1A) above, failing agreement between all the parent members elected to the Board, shall be selected by drawing lots.</li>

	<li>(1C) A staff member elected under paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section 3 of this Act shall hold office for a term of four years.'.—

	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 60 would stagger the terms of office of elected members on a board of management of a self-governing school on a basis similar to that achieved for the elected members of school boards under the 1988 Act. The amendment is unnecessary, given that its purposes are achieved under schedule 4 and clause 4. Under paragraph 2 of schedule 4, elected members of the board of management who have transferred on the incorporation date from the school board continue in office for such periods as they would have done had they remained members of the school board. If a vacancy occurs in the elected membership of the school board before the incorporation date, but no by-election has been held before that date under the 1988 Act, under paragraph 4(b) of schedule 4 the vacancy becomes one of the board of management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 4(3), the filling of a post on the
	<br><blockquote><p>"death, resignation or removal of a member"</p></blockquote>
of a board of management has the effect that the person serves in office for only the remainder of the term of office of the person whose place is filled. In the case of the board of management on transition, that would be the previous holder of the office that has become vacant. In terms of paragraph 4(b) of schedule 4, the vacancy would be on the board of management, but would be derived from a vacancy on the preceding school board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the provisions is to preserve the staggering of the terms of office of elected members of a board of management, as would be the case with a school board. That means that the amendment is superfluous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We went over most of this ground when we discussed amendment No. 40. If we always considered the worst case that could happen under a given set of proposals, we should never be able to do anything, because it is impossible to constitute a responsible body that is entirely proof against malicious or incompetent individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In constructing the Bill, we have tried to strike a balance between the need for stability and continuity and the demands of democratic accountability. Even with the increased number of appointed members, elected members will still be in the majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are an attack on the proposed longer term of office of appointed members, and substitute a standard period of four years for all. That, together with the proposal in amendment No. 40 to increase the number of appointed members on the school board, has been a particular feature of criticism of our proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In trying to strike a balance, we have made the term of office of appointed members longer than that of elected members. Nevertheless, no one will serve for life—the term
	<span class='label label-info column'>276</span>
of office is limited. As I have already agreed to reconsider the provisions for the number of appointed members, I shall reconsider this matter at the same time. I am happy to give the Committee that undertaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
