<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Trustee Bill [Lords]</h1></div>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That, during the proceedings on the Trustee Bill [<i>Lords</i>], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock.—<i>[Mr. Lock.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Garnier <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harborough)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I, in endorsing the sittings motion, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. O'Hara, and trust that you will not be troubled on any day other than this?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Burnett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Torridge and West Devon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I also welcome you, Mr. O'Hara? The Bill received considerable attention in the other place, and I expect that, although it will be considered carefully here, proceedings will be reasonably swift.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p>4.31 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee recommends that the Trustee Bill [<i>Lords</i>] ought to be read a Second time.</p></blockquote>
I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. O'Hara. Because we are in a Second Reading Committee, as the Bill is a Law Commission Bill, I am obliged to say slightly more than would be usual in Committee, but shall endeavour to keep my remarks as brief as possible. However, if hon. Members want further detail on any point that I cover sketchily, I shall be happy to respond, with the leave of the Committee.<br><br>
The creation of the legal concept of a trust is one of the great achievements of the common law. To quote Maitland, and with apologies to Welsh and Scottish members of the Committee,
<br><blockquote><p>If we were asked what is the greatest and most distinctive achievement performed by Englishmen in the field of jurisprudence I cannot think that we should have any better answer to give than this, namely, the development from century to century of the trust idea.</p></blockquote>
The essence of a trust is that the legal owners of property are obliged to deal with that property not as beneficial owners but for the benefit of other people or for other purposes.<br><br>
There may be some who think the idea of a trust is a dry legal concept with no relation to everyday life. They are wrong. Almost every local or national charity takes life as a trust, and thus has trustees who are affected by this Bill. Everything from village halls, millennium greens and playing fields through to the largest charitable trusts or pension funds and a host of other local and national organisations operate as trusts. Every relative who takes on the position of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
executor or administrator of a will holds property in trust and acts as a trustee. The Bill has been widely welcomed and it is estimated that it will boost the income of the charity sector by up to £40 million a year.<br><br>
Trusts have existed in one form or another for centuries. The law governing the proper objects of charities is still broadly that laid down in a statute of Elizabeth I. The bulk of the law of trusts operating today dates from 1925 and mention will be made several times in Committee of the Trustee Investments Act 1961. Despite the extent of the growth of the trust in the modern world, the law relating to the powers and duties of trustees has not kept pace with their evolving social and economic role. That has become particularly clear in the field of investments, which has changed, quite fundamentally, with the introduction of new technology. As a result, trustees who derive their authority from, usually older, trust documents that make either no provision or insufficient provision for handling trust investments, are finding it increasingly difficult to satisfy their primary duty of acting in the best interests of their beneficiaries. The Bill will, with significant modification, implement changes to the law in England and Wales that were recommended by the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission in their joint report "Trustees' Powers and Duties", which was published a year ago this month. The report was the result of the commissions' usual rigorous research and consultation that was carried out partly in conjunction with the Treasury. The Bill has also been subject to constructive and helpful debate in another place.<br><br>
The principal change will be to create a wider statutory power of investment that can be used in default of any, or sufficient, power in the trust instrument. The new power of investment will replace the existing limited power in the Trustee Investments Act 1961 and will be supported by a range of powers. It will be possible to appoint agents, nominees and custodians, to insure trust property and to pay professional trustees. The measures aim to facilitate the better administration of trusts and enable trustees to take full advantage of the wider investment opportunities now open to them while protecting the interests of beneficiaries against abuse of the new powers. As I said, the new powers will apply only if, and to the extent that, the trust instrument does not provide otherwise.<br><br>
Hon. Members may be aware that when the Bill passed through its stages in another place, my right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor was assisted by an atmosphere of constructive support. That was engendered partly by his and our Department's openness to considering representations made on both sides and partly by the positive approach of their Lordships to this undoubtedly good and worthwhile Bill. Indeed, Lord Dahrendorf, a trustee of the Charities Aid Foundation, spoke very kindly of the way in which the Bill was handled by the Lord Chancellor. He suggested that other people might usefully regard that handling as a model. It is satisfying to hear words of commendation from so

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
respected a source. I hope that Opposition Members and their right hon. and hon. Friends will approach stages in this House in the same constructive and helpful way.<br><br>
Although we are meeting in Committee, this is a Second Reading debate on a technical and complex Bill. It falls to me to take us through it in detail and to explain to hon. Members who are here today and who read our debates in <i>Hansard</i> the Government's thinking.<br><br>
Part I introduces the duty of care that will apply, subject to schedule 1, to the exercise of new powers by trustees. The clauses create a precisely defined statutory duty of care applicable to trustees when they carry out their functions under the Bill or equivalent functions under the trust instrument. As in the law generally, the phrase "duty of care" means a duty to take care to avoid causing injury or loss. The new duty will bring certainty and consistency to the standard of competence and behaviour expected of trustees. That codifies common law in which there is a duty of care. It removes uncertainty and highlights that requirement as being a key duty of the trustees. The duty is a default provision. It may be excluded or modified by the terms of the trust and will apply to the way in which trustees exercise their discretionary powers. It will not apply to a decision by the trustees as to whether the discretionary power should be exercised in the first place.<br><br>
Clause 1 defines the new statutory duty of care. The circumstances in which it will apply are defined by clause 2, which gives effect to schedule 1. It will not apply outside those circumstances. To comply with the new duty, a trustee must show a degree of skill and care that is reasonable in the circumstances of the case and that makes allowances for his or her special knowledge, experience or professional status.<br><br>
Part II implements the most important part of the commissions' report. It establishes a new regime for investment by trustees who have no powers of investment—or whose powers of investment are not wide enough—under the terms of the trust documents, another statute or subordinate legislation and who are not prevented by their trust documents from using such powers. Most modem trust instruments expressly confer wide investment powers. Older trust instruments frequently do not.<br><br>
In the absence of express powers under the trust instrument, the trustees must rely on legislation to define their powers. At the moment, they are restricted to the use of default powers contained in the Trustee Investments Act 1961. The powers, though generous when enacted, are now considered too narrow. The controls in that Act are considered to have worked against the best interests of beneficiaries, to have been too restrictive and to have been too expensive to administer. The powers will continue to be default powers, and they are expected to be of greatest utility to older trusts, including many charities, and to trusts arising from home-made wills or on intestacy.<br><br>
Clause 3 gives trustees the power to invest trust assets as though they were the absolute owners—a significant shift away from the present position. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
new power is to be known as the general power of investment. However, the power granted by the clause is not quite carte blanche. Perhaps most importantly, it does not allow for investment in land other than by way of loans secured on land. However, such a power is granted by clause 8, to which I will refer.<br><br>
Clauses 4 and 5 impose specific duties on trustees to keep in mind the need for diversification and the suitability of investments, and to obtain and consider proper advice where appropriate. Those duties will apply to trustees in the exercise of a power of investment. Clause 6 provides that the new general power of investment is a default provision. It specifies that, subject to clause 7, relating to trusts in existence when the Bill is brought into force, the new power will be available to all trustees in addition to any limited express power of investment that they might have already, but subject to any limitation imposed by the trust instrument or by primary or subordinate legislation. Clause 7 provides for the application of part II to existing trusts of the relevant types.<br><br>
The new general power of investment has only limited application to land and is, in any event, restricted to investment. Part III therefore makes separate provision to remedy the disparity between the powers of different types of trustees in relation to the purchase of land. Clause 8 gives trustees the power to acquire freehold or leasehold land in the United Kingdom as an investment, for occupation by a beneficiary or for any other reason. Clauses 9 and 10 act on the part in much the same way as clauses 6 and 7 act on part II.<br><br>
Part IV deals with the use by trustees of agents, nominees and custodians. Clauses 11 to 15 set out the powers of collective delegation that trustees will have in default of express powers being conferred on the trust instrument. Clause 11(1) provides that, subject to the provisions of part IV, trustees may delegate any or all of their delegable functions to an agent. In the case of non-charitable trusts, to which clause 11 applies, subsection (2) provides that the trustees may delegate any function except, first, a function relating to whether or in what way trust assets should be distributed; secondly, a power to allocate fees or other payments to capital or income; thirdly, a power to appoint a trustee and, fourthly, a power conferred by the trust instrument or an enactment either to delegate a trustee function or to appoint a nominee or custodian. Subsection (3) sets out the functions that a trustee of a charitable trust may delegate.<br><br>
Clause 12 sets out those who may and may not be appointed as agents. Subject to it not being possible to appoint a beneficiary, there are no other restrictions. Clause 13 makes it clear that, although an agent is not subject to the duty of care under clause 1, which applies only to trustees, the exercise of a delegated function by an agent is subject to any specific duties or restrictions attached to the function. Agents will be subject to the common law duty of care, but the majority of agents will be held to a duty of care made explicit in the contract by which the trustees appointed them as agents. Under clause 14, trustees will be free to agree the terms for the appointment of an agent subject
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0678">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
to the limitation imposed by subsection (2). The basis on which the agency will have effect will be governed by the general law of agency.<br><br>
Clause 15 provides for special restrictions on the delegation of the asset management functions of trustees, none of which has previously been capable of being delegated unless the trustees have been given express power to do so in the trust instrument. Before trustees may delegate any of their asset management functions, they must prepare a policy statement giving guidance as to how the functions ought to be exercised to ensure that the functions will be exercised in the best interests of the trust. For ethical investment trusts, for example, those criteria should be set out in the policy statement.<br><br>
Clauses 16 to 20 govern the powers of trustees to appoint nominees and custodians in cases where the trust instrument contains no express powers to do so. Clauses 16 and 17 provide for the appointment of nominees and custodians respectively. Whereas clause 17 provides a power to appoint a custodian, clause 18 imposes a duty to do so in respect of any securities payable to bearer that are held on behalf of the trust.<br><br>
Clause 19 makes it clear that to be eligible for appointment as a nominee or custodian, a person must normally carry on a business that consists of or includes acting as a nominee or custodian. However, there is an alternative to that requirement in subsection (2), so that trustees may use special purpose vehicles for nominee or custodianship purposes. Clause 20 has an effect in relation to the appointment of nominees and custodians similar to that in clause 14 on the appointment of agents.<br><br>
Clauses 21 to 23 provide for the review by trustees of the appointments of agents, nominees and custodians, and the liability of the trustees for such persons. Clause 21 defines when clauses 22 and 23 will apply. Clause 22(1) imposes on trustees a single duty that has three elements during any agency, nominineeship or custodianship. Those elements are: first, to keep under review the terms of the appointment performance; secondly, to consider whether to exercise any power of intervention that they have; and, thirdly, to exercise their power of intervention if necessary.<br><br>
Clause 23 sets out the criteria governing trustees' liability for agents, nominees and custodians. Clauses 24 to 27 make certain supplementary general provisions in relation to the use of agents, nominees and custodians by trustees.<br><br>
Part V makes provision for remuneration of certain trustees in certain circumstances. It does so by setting down rules of construction for express charging clauses in trust instruments and by providing a power to remunerate certain trustees in default of such express provision in the trust instrument.<br><br>
Clause 28 introduces new rules for the construction of express charging clauses. The rules apply whenever trusts are created, provided that their application is not inconsistent with the terms of the trust instrument. However, they apply only in relation to services provided on or after the legislation's commencement.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
The clause provides that the services for which a trust corporation or a trustee acting in a professional capacity may be entitled to payment include services that are capable of being provided by a lay trustee. However, as it is widely agreed that charitable trustees should be treated more strictly than other trustees in such circumstances, because of the nature of their responsibilities, where a charitable trustee who is not a trust corporation fulfils the other requirements that would entitle him to payment under the trust instrument, he must scale further obstacles; he may not be a sole trustee and must have the agreement of the majority of the other trustees.<br><br>
Clause 29 effectively inserts a professional charging clause into any trust instrument that does not contain express provision either for or against remuneration of the trustee in question, and where the entitlement to remuneration of the trustee is not subject to provisions in another statute or subordinate legislation.<br><br>
Clause 30 confers a power on the Secretary of State to make provision by statutory instrument, in due course, for the remuneration of charitable trustees. Because of the significant nature of that potential change, any order made by the Secretary of State will be made by affirmative resolution.<br><br>
Clauses 31 and 32 make provision for the reimbursement of trustees' expenses and for the payment of remuneration and expenses to agents, nominees and custodians who are not trustees. Those provisions apply to services provided or expenses incurred on or after the commencement of the legislation on behalf of trusts, whenever created.<br><br>
Part VI deals with miscellaneous and supplementary matters with which I shall not weary the Cttee in any detail, as they are covered in the Bill's explanatory notes, but I will draw the Committee's attention briefly to clause 41, which is a Henry VIII clause. It is included to allow those whose investment powers are governed by the 1961 Act, but who wish to take advantage of the new powers granted by parts II and III to apply to the Minister to be enabled to do so by the amendment of their governing statute. The Minister will be required to consult anyone who seems to him likely to be affected by the proposed amendment of a local, personal or private Act.<br><br>
Subsection (1) gives a Minister of the Crown power to make such amendments to any Act, including Acts extending to places outside England and Wales, as appears to him to be appropriate in consequence of or in connection with parts II or III. The reason for the extension of that power to Acts that operate beyond England and Wales is that, where a provision has UK-wide application, it may be anomalous to amend it in relation to England and Wales but not otherwise.<br><br>
Over many years, the statutory investment powers of many organisations that are not trusts have none the less been defined in terms of the default powers contained in the 1961 Act. Many of those are thought to be governed by local, personal or private Acts, and not all of them are amenable to identification by the usual methods such as LEXIS searches.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0679">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
I shall now deal with the schedules to the Bill. Schedule 1 specifies the circumstances in which the new statutory duty of care will apply. Schedule 2 makes minor and consequential amendments. Schedule 3 makes transitional provisions and savings. Schedule 4 deals with repeals.<br><br>
This is a relatively substantial and complex Bill, which I hope will receive a warm welcome from both sides of the House. I hope that I have struck a reasonable balance between brevity and detail, and that hon. Members will be content to make up for any deficiency of illustrative detail from the explanatory notes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask the Minister an innocent question. In clause 3, the "general power of investment" precludes investment in property other than from a loan, yet clause 8 gives carte blanche to invest in property. What is the reason for that curious difference?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Gentleman an example. Part II is concerned with the investment of trust assets to produce a revenue for the benefit of the purpose of the trust. However, there may be other reasons than the production of revenue for investing in property. For example, investment in property made under a will may be made not to produce a return but to provide a place for the principal beneficiary to live. That is clearly a wider investment power, although it is perfectly proper under the trust instrument, but it would not be made to produce a return for the same objectives.<br><br>
It is a pleasure to bring forward another Law Commission Bill. The scrupulousness of the processes that the commission went through in producing the report, its wide range of consultations and the regard in which its final conclusions are generally held make piloting such Bills through the legislative process less hazardous than is sometimes the case. The Bill has received a widespread welcome from the trust and charity worlds. The thorough discussions to which it gave rise during its passage through another place were thoroughly worthwhile. I look forward to the co-operation of the Opposition parties in helping to move it on.<br><br>
I must tell the Committee that the principal author of the report, Mr. Charles Harpum, who was the subject of considerable praise in the other place, has been of considerable assistance to me, and I hope that his contribution will be widely recognised. The Bill will provide an important and worthwhile enhancement of the powers of trustees for the benefit of trusts and their beneficiaries. I commend it to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>4.53 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garnier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I join the Parliamentary Secretary to the Lord Chancellor's Department in praising the work of the Law Commission for England and Wales and of that for Scotland, which had a considerable input into the Bill. I single out the work of Mr. Harpum, the principal guide to the Bill for both Houses of Parliament.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
I also welcome the Parliamentary Secretary's reference to Lord Dahrendorf, because it gives me the opportunity, although it has nothing to do with the Bill, to note that Lord Dahrendorf is the third of the four wardens of St. Antony's college, Oxford—I am wearing its tie today—whose 50th anniversary was celebrated last weekend by those of us who are and were members of that college. That was entirely fortuitous; I am most grateful, Mr. O'Hara, for letting me slip that one under your desk.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have only just noticed that the hon. and learned Gentleman has strayed out of order, although he is now coming back.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garnier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like a boomerang, I keep coming back.<br><br>
I am grateful to my hon. Friends the Members for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) and for Christchurch (Mr. Chope), who will, no doubt, keep me on the straight and narrow, in order and on the subject. I dare say that the hon. Members for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd), who is an experienced lawyer, and for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett), who has far greater experience of trust law than I do, will keep an eye on what I do and an ear to what say.<br><br>
On 14 April, the Lord Chancellor began Second Reading in the other place by saying:
<br><blockquote><p>Although trust law appears arcane, trusts and charities touch the lives of many. Our pensions may be in pension trusts; our spare cash may be in investment trusts; we may make regular donations to charitable trusts; and may spend parts of our holidays here at home on the premises of the National Trust. We may ourselves be trustees of private or of charitable trusts in our personal or our professional capacities.—[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 14 April 2000; Vol. 612, c. 373.]</p></blockquote>
We should take note of two of those points. First, as Lord Goodhart pointed out, the National Trust is a corporate body and not a trust—an error that the Lord Chancellor graciously conceded in later discussions in the other place. Secondly, the Bill is not as dull or as dry as it might appear to hon. Members who are wondering why they are here. Paragraph 33(2) contains a reference that will be of direct and immediate interest to hon. Members in this Room, as it affects the House of Commons Members' Fund Act 1962. Hon. Members who have not yet read right through the Bill should do so before the end of these proceedings, as there is much of interest to be found between its covers. The Lord Chancellor continued on Second Reading by saying:
<br><blockquote><p>This Bill will implement, with minor modification, the changes in relation to the law of England and Wales recommended by the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission in their joint report, Trustees' Powers and Duties (1999)…published last summer. The report was the result of the Commissions' usual rigorous research and consultation, carried out partly in conjunction with the Treasury, and I am pleased to be able to bring the Bill before your Lordships' House today.—[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 14 April 2000; Vol. 612, c. 373.]</p></blockquote>
I know that the Minister shares that pleasure and I shall not do anything to damage or to minimise the pleasure that the Lord Chancellor or the Minister have in doing what they are doing.<br><br>

I welcome the Bill on behalf of the official Opposition. It will change the law in England and Wales governing trust powers to invest trust funds where there are no satisfactory express provisions in the trust deed, and it will make the administration of trusts more effective where the deed lacks express provision. As the Minister explained, and as the Lord Chancellor explained in another place, very few statutory changes have been made to this branch of the law since 1925. One of the few changes, the Trustee Investments Act 1961, is now out of date and a liability for many trusts. At my great age, I do not find 1961 as distant as the Minister seems to think it, although my knowledge of the law of trusts was only marginally smaller in 1961 than it is today. The law of trusts was discussed in the House during this Parliament, when the current Secretary of State for Defence was the Minister at the Lord Chancellor's Department. However, that is now just a distant memory, although it was a good deal more recent than 1961.<br><br>
The Bill is the first major change in 75 years and will implement reforms to powers of trustees as recommended in a report published last year by the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission. Its text is based on the draft contained in the report which followed extensive consultation with practitioners, one of whom would have been the noble Lord Goodhart who contributed fully to the debates on the Bill in the other place. As the Minister has made clear, many older trusts and charities, trusts created under wills and those arising under intestacies give limited powers to their trustees as a result of inadequate drafting. Present trust law restricts trustees in the investments that they can make. Moreover, trustees are unable to place all their trust funds in investments that give the best returns. Outmoded restrictions also prevent trustees from taking advantage of the best modern investment services.<br><br>
As a result, a great many small family trusts and charities have lost millions of pounds over the years compared with the amounts that they should have generated. It has been calculated that the removal of some restrictions on investments will benefit the charity sector alone by some £40 million a year. The Bill will lead to a significant improvement in the returns on capital of many trusts and charities and will improve and modernise their administration. The word "modernise" should encourage Labour members of the Committee. Further modernisation of the law on trust is needed to address other issues that are not dealt with under the Bill.<br><br>
The official Opposition certainly hope that measures will be introduced in the near future to deal with matters such as the rights of creditors against a trust and trustees' indemnity clauses. Given the Government's current overcrowded legislative programme and the threat that hon. Members may have to spend this Friday morning in the House instead of returning to their constituencies, we do not want such issues introduced into the Bill through
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
amendments, since pressures on parliamentary time could lead to the Bill being lost. We would not want that, would we?<br><br>
In addition, some aspects of the Bill will require further consultation before they reach the legislative stage and given the candid way in which the Minister has dealt with the Bill so far, that will be fruitful and worth while. While more reform is needed, we believe that if the Bill becomes law in its present form, as amended by the other place, a significant first step will have been taken. I invite members of the official Opposition to give the Bill a good passage through the House.</span></p>
<p>5.2 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Colman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Putney)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to declare a non-pecuniary interest as chair of the all-party group on socially responsible investment. However, I rise with some trepidation as I am a non-trust lawyer. If I put my foot in it, I am sure that members of the Committee who are lawyers will put me right. I strongly support the Bill; it has the support of the Association of Charitable Foundations, which has been campaigning for it for several years and is keen for the Bill to become law. I shall be doing nothing to stop that, and I congratulate the ACF on its campaigning, as I congratulate the Government on finding parliamentary time to introduce the Bill. I pay particular tribute to Nigel Siederer, the chief executive of the ACF, who has been assiduous in his lobbying of the Lord Chancellor and his Department to ensure that it is enacted.<br><br>
I am worried about the marrying up of the Bill with the regulation that was laid before Parliament on 3 July that deals with socially responsible investment. The regulation was secondary legislation under the Pensions Act 1995, which required pension fund trustees to disclose in their statement of investment principles the extent to which social, environmental or ethical considerations were taken into account in the selection, retention and realisation of investments and the policy, if any, of directing the exercise of the rights, including voting rights, attached to investments. The Government do not require trustees to have a policy on such issues and if they do not have a policy, they must state that fact. The new regulations apply to local government pension schemes and to stakeholder pension schemes under both contract and trust law.<br><br>
It was interesting that the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) mentioned the House of Commons Members' fund. The trustees of that fund worked on the basis that the new regulation also applied to themselves, and made a full statement of investment principle, which I applaud.<br><br>
The problem is that the Bill makes no similar requirement for the statement of investment principle to cover the same areas. Clause 15(2) requires the use of a policy statement or the equivalent to the Pensions Act 1995 statement of investment principle. According to the explanatory notes, the policy statement may include ethical considerations relevant to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0681">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
investment policy of the trust. Unlike pension funds, there is no requirement to disclose socially responsible investment policies.<br><br>
Although amendments were tabled, the matter was not discussed in the other place, either on Second Reading, Report or Third Reading. If the Bill were amended to introduce such a change, I assume that the amendment would have to be made to clause 4, which describes the standard investment criteria in relation to a trust. It identifies those criteria as suitability and the need for diversification.<br><br>
Are the explanatory notes deficient? Should they extend to matters other than ethical investment? Alternatively, can secondary legislation be laid subsequently, as in the case of the Pensions Act 1995? Hon. Members are extremely interested in those matters, and there is widespread support in the pensions industry for sensible proposals on disclosure.<br><br>
On corporate governance, the Bill must not impose inhibitions on the way in which trustees exercise rights attached to investments in support of the objects of the trust. Anything less would be counter to the Government's interest in encouraging responsible ownership by institutional investors. Will the Minister clarify that nothing in the Bill will interfere with trustees exercising or delegating—using contract law—rights attaching to their investments, including voting rights.<br><br>
Those two matters are extremely important. I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify whether the issues of socially responsible investment and corporate governance are adequately covered by the Bill.</span></p>
<p>5.8 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I declare an interest. I am a lawyer, although I am not practising, and I am also the trustee of numerous trusts.<br><br>
The Bill has been welcomed by beneficiaries and practitioners throughout England and Wales. It implements reforms to trustee powers and duties recommended by the Law Commission and Scottish Law Commission report. I should like to join the Minister and the hon. and learned Member for Harborough in paying tribute to the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission for producing such a learned report. As other Committee members will know, the Bill was debated at length in another place. I am delighted to put on record my gratitude, and that of this House, to my noble Friend Lord Goodhart, for his excellent work there. Always the first to give praise and credit to others, he is an eminent trust lawyer and deserves our gratitude.<br><br>
The Bill has far-reaching consequences for trusts, but is relatively narrow in its scope. It will change the law in England and Wales that covers trustees' powers to invest trust funds when there are no express provisions, or no satisfactory ones, in the trust deed. The Bill also makes arrangements for the administration of trusts to be more effective when the trust deed or the will lacks express provision.<br><br>
The Committee will be delighted to hear that I do not propose to dwell at length on the Settled Land Act 1925, which we discussed last year when we debated
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
what was then the Trustee Delegation Bill; it was referred to by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough. Since the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996, it is no longer possible to create a settlement under the 1925 Act, but settlements made before the 1996 Act continue until they are wound up. I hope that the Minister can assure us that the Bill will apply equally to remaining settlements under the 1925 Act.<br><br>
Trust law affects nearly all of us in some way. It affects wills and intestacies, but also family trusts, employee benefit trusts, pension funds, investment funds and, importantly, charities. Will the Minister confirm that the Bill applies to trusts arising from intestacy? What impact will the Bill have when a continuing trust has not commenced but when trustees or executors and administrators are winding up an estate, whether there is a will or a partial or complete intestacy?<br><br>
The Bill raises important matters, such as the duty of care for trustees and its obligations. There are clauses seeking to exempt or exculpate trustees. Those clauses are not explicit so far as exemption is concerned. Nevertheless, I want to discuss the matter further. I am anxious to know whether the Bill will impact on an estate during administration. My noble Friend Lord Goodhart referred to the latter points on clauses on trusts that specifically exculpate professional trustees, and I shall refer to those matters later.<br><br>
I heard this morning on the wireless that the Government would address the obligations and responsibilities of pension fund trustees. I refer the Committee to a debate on the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill on 11 January. In a serious speech, the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Crausby) made points about the constitution and proper control of pension funds and member-appointed representatives. It is important that there is an obligation to ensure that pension schemes are sufficiently funded and properly invested.<br><br>
Although some of those matters do not come under the aegis of the Minister, I look forward to hearing his views on them. I should have thought that all pension fund trustees have a duty to act in the interests of their beneficiaries and potential beneficiaries, as a matter of general trust law. That relates to sufficiency of funding and the appropriateness or otherwise of investments. There should and must be real and effective recourse against trustees who breach those duties, as well as continual monitoring and auditing of the pension trusts to endeavour to ensure that problems do not arise in the first place.<br><br>
I shall return to the main thrust of the Bill. It is appreciated that, over the years, a great number of family trusts and charities have lost out on millions of pounds that they should have generated to help beneficiaries. The Bill will remove some of the restrictions on investments, and will be of benefit to private individuals and charities. The Minister and the hon. and learned Member for Harborough referred to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0682">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
the PDFM Ltd. estimate that the charities sector alone should benefit by approximately £40 million a year from the Bill. That is a significant sum.<br><br>
The Bill falls into six parts. Part I imposes a duty of care on trustees, and part II gives a much wider investment power to trustees. Henceforth, trustees will have to exercise reasonable skill and care, taking into account
<br><blockquote><p>any special knowledge or experience</p></blockquote>
that they may have. That might appear to be a let-out for unqualified trustees, but it should not be. Before accepting a trusteeship, individuals should be aware that they will be expected to show skill and conscientiousness. If they do not believe that they can aspire to and match that skill and conscientiousness, they should refuse to act or renounce.<br><br>
Trustees are given the same power to make investments as they would have if they were outright or absolute owners of the trust assets. The Bill contains safeguards; for example, trustees will have to take proper advice about investments, unless they reasonably decide that that is unnecessary. Having taken that decision, they will be open to legal action for negligence if they do not exercise reasonable skill and care.<br><br>
Part III deals with acquiring land for a trust and introduces a power that allows trustees to hold freehold or leashold land for any purpose and in any part of the United Kingdom. Those of us who have drafted wills and trusts over the years are well used to the words
<br><blockquote><p>whether for use as a beneficiary or not.</p></blockquote>
The Bill will make such words redundant. There will be no inhibition on the purchase of property for the beneficiaries of a trust. I understand that the Bill will not give powers to trustees to invest in property overseas, whether for use for a beneficiary or not. If trustees want that power, it must be contained in the trust deed itself.<br><br>
Trustees will be able to lend money to beneficiaries to enable them to purchase property, but it would be a rash trustee who did not secure such a loan by a first mortgage. Presumably, such power to lend money would be restricted under the Bill to the purchase of property in the United Kingdom by the beneficiary, with the benefit of a mortgage advance from trustees. I hope that the Minister will clarify that point. Must that mortgage be a first mortgage?<br><br>
Part IV refers to the employment of agents, including the use of nominees and custodians. Part V seeks to clarify when trustees can be paid. As I understand it, rules are set out as to how professional trustees are paid and for the reimbursement of their expenses as well as those of their agents, nominees and custodians. The rule is reversed that a charging clause in a trust deed is strictly construed against professional trustees, and will provide for remuneration of certain trustees when there is no express professional charging clause in the deed.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
In the other place, Lord Dahrendorf and Lord Phillips of Sudbury expressed some anxieties about payments made to trustees of charities under clause 28 or as a result of an order introduced under clause 30. I understand that the Government accepted the restriction on clause 30 proposed by the House of Lords Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation. Will that prevent clause 30 from being used to give trustees of charitable trusts rights to remuneration in circumstances in which lay people would not be entitled to remuneration?<br><br>
The Bill will make it easier to pay professional trustees. The quid pro quo must be to make challenging excessive fees simpler, cheaper and more straightforward for beneficiaries and people other than trustees involved in a charitable trust.<br><br>
The Bill must not give a blank cheque to professional trustees of any trust, including trust corporations, to charge excessive fees. Provision must be made to facilitate taxation of such costs and to allow them to be challenged in order to ensure that they are reduced in appropriate circumstances. I understand that solicitors' fees will be open to challenge, but I would welcome hearing more from the Minister about that and about how the fees of other professional trustees—including not only solicitors but trust corporations, accountants and valuers, among others—might be challenged.<br><br>
On Second Reading in the other place, Lord Goodhart made the major criticism that the Bill will do
<br><blockquote><p>nothing to restrict the inclusion of trustee exemption clauses in trust instruments.—[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 14 April 2000; Vol. 612, c. 383.]</p></blockquote>
Over the years, there has been much comment on and criticism of clauses in trusts exculpating professional trustees. In Committee and on Report in the other place there were further discussions on the matter, and I look forward to hearing more from the Minister. The matter is extremely important. Although it may be fair to allow a friend of the family who acts a trustee without remuneration to be exempt from professional negligence, there can be no justification for extending that privilege to professional trustees.<br><br>
Lord Goodhart referred also to the rights of creditors against trustees and to trustees who enter into contracts to purchase property on behalf of a trust. Unless the trustee makes it clear—and it is a term of the contract—that his or her liability extends only to the assets of the trust, he or she can be personally liable for the entire debt or liability under the contract. That is the law at present, and I can find nothing in the Bill that changes it. It is another reason for trustees to consider carefully their responsibilities before they accept appointment.<br><br>
I recognise that this is a fairly turgid subject, and I finish by saying that Liberal Democrat Members look forward to the Bill becoming law later this year. It should lead to significant improvements in returns for beneficiaries and charities. I have set out for the Committee some important misgivings and questions, and I hope that the Government will respond to them.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
<p>5.24 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon, I declare an interest as a member of the Bar and trustee of various trusts. I may be able to help. The administration provision for trusts arising on intestacy is in clause 35. I think that the Minister will agree.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was especially keen to know about the impact of the Bill on estates in administration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall leave it to the Minister to answer that.<br><br>
I shall be brief. Although the Bill is short, it updates—and, it has been said, codifies—an area of law that is much in need of revision. I welcome the fact that it more accurately reflects investment trends and needs. It is potentially far-reaching; it is not limited to the rather esoteric area of trust law, which is typically the preserve of the very wealthy. It defines a trust instrument to include a will or letters of administration arising on intestacy. The legislation could therefore cover all of us, whatever situation we are in. It is a broad Bill, and I largely welcome it.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Member for Harborough referred to pensions, savings and so on. The law in that area has been unclear for many years, is frequently archaic and is based on a great deal of piecemeal legislation and case law. The Bill might not at first sight appear substantial, but it becomes clear on reflection that it is. I very much welcome the definition of duty of care in clause 1. Lawyers like myself argue ad nauseum about the various definitions, incidences and extent of duties of care, and it is pleasing to see a good attempt at a statutory definition. I hope that the Bill will offer guidance to those acting as trustees, whether lay or professional, and protection to beneficiaries who might have suffered loss or worse at the hands of negligent or careless trustees.<br><br>
I also welcome the Bill's clarity. As any unfortunate law student knows, trust law has a tendency to the obtuse. The Bill is straightforward and gives little room for misinterpretation. I am pleased that the Government have acted on the report of the Law Commission and accepted many of its detailed recommendations. The extension of trustee powers of investment is most welcome, especially in conjunction with the duty of care in clause 1.<br><br>
The Bill is good and it merits swift passage.</span></p>
<p>5.27 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Christopher Chope <span class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to reinforce points already made about the remuneration of trustees. I agree with the Bill's change so that trustees will have the power to recover their expenses. Where a trust is silent about remuneration of trustees, it is reasonable that trustees should be remunerated. My understanding is that where a trustee specifically requires that there should be no trustee remuneration, that can be overridden.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the Bill is highly technical. The details may not be clear at first reading, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that where a trust
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
deed specifically provides that the trustees shall act without remuneration, that trust deed will take precedence, whether the trustee is lay, professional or a trust corporation, although one would naturally not expect a trust corporation voluntarily to become involved in a trust without remuneration. The principles of the trust deed will take precedence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that reassurance.<br><br>
In the debate in the other place, Lord Goodhart incorrectly asserted that home-made wills do not always contain provisions for remuneration, with the obvious result that no professional person can be expected to accept an appointment as trustee of the will. In fact, many people are prepared to take on the role of trustees of wills, even if they have professional qualifications, without expecting remuneration. That has been part of our history.<br><br>
My next point is not just a case of sour grapes on my side of the legal profession. Experience suggests that costs are often run up unreasonably, particularly when solicitors administer trusts. Innocent beneficiaries suffer as a result. Nothing in the Bill will limit the remuneration of professional trustees, other than by saying that it should be reasonable. However, a senior solicitor's charge-out rate of £200 an hour would remain the same, even if he were engaged in trust work during a quiet period when he had nothing else to do. The question is whether it would be reasonable for somebody with such a charge-out rate to undertake such trust work and expect to be remunerated on the basis of his professional expertise rather than on the basis of what the trust could afford to pay.<br><br>
No issue of affordability is raised. There will be examples of older trusts in all our constituencies, established for specific purposes and with limited resources. The Bill could mean that many such trusts run up enormous bills unwittingly because they have solicitors acting as trustees who will exploit the situation, spending much more time dealing with the business than they might otherwise have done, perhaps because of a downturn in conveyancing work. In such a case, the trust would end up being milked. We are all familiar with the cartoon in which solicitors pull on both ends of a cow. People might argue over legacies, leaving nothing for the beneficiaries under the will as all the money goes to lawyers. I hope that the Committee does not wish that to happen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer is to apply to the Law Society for a non-contentious cost order. The society would assess whether the charging rate and the hours spent were reasonable. The safeguard already exists.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but that action is after the event. Lay people confronted with such a bill will often say that it is extraordinarily large without realising that a remedy may be open to them. Something should be done in advance to prevent detriment to the beneficiaries of such trusts.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0684">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
<p>5.33 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Hurst <span class='memberconstituency'>(Braintree)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise nervously to declare interests both as a solicitor and as a trustee of several trusts. I would like to address two points. The hon. Member for Christchurch has said unkind things about the profession of several members of the Committee and myself. I would be foolish to deny that there might have been over-charging down the centuries. However, remedies against solicitors can be properly pursued by way of remuneration certificates and other means. The ambit of such certificates should possibly be expanded.<br><br>
The problem of banks and trust corporations has occurred to me. It seems unfashionable to say it, but they might charge more than High street solicitors. That is realised more now than it used to be. They might also decline to pursue their function as trustee and executor if an estate was not large enough to provide the remuneration that should come to them. That seems to be a defect. A trust corporation might encourage a customer of its associated bank to take out a will through its heavily advertised executor and trustee department on the basis that, when the person dies, a large fee will be earned for the bank. The person might live a good few years and die considerably poorer than the bank anticipated. The bank will normally apply a provision allowing it to decline to take out probate on that person's behalf. That seems to be grossly unfair to someone who relied on a major financial institution to protect his or her interests on death. Although I would be foolish to say that solicitors have hearts of gold, one sometimes finds that a solicitor will step in when the bank has defaulted and administer the estate for rather less than £200 an hour for the benefit of someone who has been a client for many years. If we are to attract more people, we need to broaden the provision to cover more than just the poor High street solicitor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garnier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch made those remarks only because he is so confident that the Conservatives will get back into Government soon and that he will not need to go back into private practice to receive fees or instructions from solicitors. The hon. Gentleman should not worry unduly. My hon. Friend will be back on the Government Front Bench very soon, receiving a Government salary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hurst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) realises that I have said all that I have said that entirely objectively, and that I do not anticipate earning large fees in the near future.<br><br>
I want to turn to ethical investments, a point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Mr. Colman). I hesitate to move into the area of trust law because although I am a trustee of several wills, my practice was in the criminal courts. However, with reference to the duty of care, I wonder whether the Bill in some way excludes trustees from making ethical investments under standard investment criteria. I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
suppose that that depends on how the duty of care is interpreted. However, objectively, if I were a beneficiary and the trustee a high-minded person who wished to buy only certain kinds of coffee or did not want to invest in anything that might harm anyone anywhere in the world, I might applaud that person's moral judgment, but would be somewhat concerned about its effect on the investments made on my behalf. I hope that the Minister will say whether the Bill excludes ethical investment, and if not, how the beneficiary can best be protected.</span></p>
<p>5.36 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With the leave of the Committee, I shall seek to respond to the many points raised by hon. Members in the limited time available, but if I do not cover all the points raised, I assure hon. Members that I will write to them.<br><br>
First, I thank all hon. Members for welcoming the Bill, especially the hon. and learned Member for Harborough on behalf of the official Opposition, and the hon. Members for Torridge and West Devon and for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. I am extremely grateful that the Bill will receive support across the House. The hon. and learned Member for Harborough said that 1961 did not seem so long ago. I am afraid that I have no memories of 1961, but I understand that I had a very good first birthday party.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman mentioned further matters for legislation, in particular trustee indemnity clauses and the liability of trustees beyond trust assets. My noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor has said in the other place that he will refer that matter to the Law Commission. Clearly, it is appropriate to carry out a thorough investigation and consultation exercise before we introduce any proposals for further reform, so that when those proposals are introduced, they will command the same consensus and support as the Bill. Those matters are not within the purview of the Bill; they are other matters of trust law and will be considered by the Law Commission.<br><br>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Putney for his contribution, and I shall reflect on his words. The Bill was not intended to lay down the principles for investment by trustees. Its purpose is to provide appropriate machinery for trustees to operate their trusts more efficiently. It will apply to all trusts regardless of their nature. Although it might be appropriate to require a large charitable trust to include its ethical investment in its policy statement, that might not be appropriate for trusteeship of an intestacy with relatively few assets, the investment and management of which are limited and constrained by cost considerations. The machinery applies to all trusts. We are not applying specific rules to a category of trusts such as pension funds and, in particular, stakeholder pension funds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Colman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand that, but could that situation hold for a small pension fund of which perhaps only one person was the beneficiary? It should be possible to draft the Bill so that the matter is not taken ad absurdum without affecting the compliance

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
of the vast proportion of trusts in stating, as pension funds have to, what they are doing in terms of ethical, social and responsible investment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that point and I shall reflect on it, but paragraph 124 of the explanatory notes sets out that trustees of occupational pension funds are in a special position. Their powers of investment and delegation are conferred by the Pensions Act 1995. Pension fund trustees and their investments are governed by that Act. Clause 26 takes them out of the Bill's purview. That explains one difference in the legislation. The Bill applies to all trusts, but pension funds are dealt with separately.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Colman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the Bill applies to charitable trusts only, but charitable trusts can make investments of such a size that they should be treated pari passu with pension funds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. The Bill applies to charitable trusts and many other trusts of a non-charitable nature. Clause 22 refers to the statement of trust investment policy. If the trust instrument that established the trust—either charitable or non-charitable—had an ethical dimension, the statement of ethical principles should be part of the trust's statement on how it expects its assets to be invested. That will allow the people who invest the assets on behalf of the trustees and beneficiaries to act in accordance with the trust instrument.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Putney also mentioned voting rights. The voting rights for shares will be held by the registered owners of the shares. That will usually be the trustees because the agent or whoever has purchased the shares will have done so in the name of trustees. They will hold the voting rights and will exercise that action in accordance with the terms of the trust instrument. If the shares are held by a nominee for any reason, exercise of voting rights will be a matter of contract between the trustee and the nominee. The matter will be determined by the trustees, no doubt exercising the duties conferred by the trust instrument to preserve their voting rights, to be exercised in accordance with the purpose of the trust. I assure my hon. Friend that the Bill does nothing to derogate from the powers and rights of trustees to exercise their voting rights in relation to shares that are held specifically by them.<br><br>
I turn now to the many points made by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon. Whenever a law student hears about settled land legislation, there is a sharp intake of breath, anxiety and a reaching for the insurance policy. Such legislation is the terror of legal students and of practitioners, and I assure the hon. Gentleman that it is also the terror of legal Ministers. The terms of the Bill cover existing settlements under the Settled Land Act 1925. I refer the hon. Gentleman to part II of schedule 2.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also asked whether the Bill impacts on personal representatives in the winding up of estates. It does, as the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, who is not currently in his seat, mentioned. I refer him to clause 35, which sets out
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
the process. Once the personal representatives are in post, they are seized of property and of the duty of trustees. The duty of care in part I and the powers of investment in part II therefore come into force on appointment, after which representatives will wind up the estate and discharge their duties with those duties and powers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take it that the Minister is saying that the entire Bill impacts on estates in the course of administration and that that includes the remuneration provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it does impact in that way and it includes the remuneration provisions, as is set out in clause 35(3). I refer the hon. Gentleman to the explanatory notes.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked next about pension funds and their trustees. As I mentioned, the Bill does not impact on them, as they are excluded by clause 36 and are governed by the Pensions Act 1995. I refer the hon. Gentleman to paragraph 124 of the explanatory notes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was aware of that. I am concerned, however, about whether the Minister's Department liaises with the Department of Trade and Industry—I presume that that is the appropriate Department—in respect of legislation on pension fund trustees. If it does so, will he make clear to that Department the importance of the points that I made about pension funds and their trustees?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, my Department is in close contact with the DTI. I entirely accept the hon. Gentleman's comments and I shall write to him in more detail. We do liaise and we appreciate the points that he made.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman referred to investment overseas, on which I should clarify our position. It will be possible to invest in overseas property only by using a company vehicle, but trustees can lend money secured on land anywhere in the world and not just in England and Wales. The Bill contains no restriction on the location of such land, although trustees who exercise powers to lend money secured on overseas land will still be subject to the duty of care. The power to insure will also be in place, so there is built-in protection for the beneficiaries, although decisions must be made by trustees in accordance with the circumstances of each individual trust.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether my memory is correct, but I thought that if trustees lent someone money to purchase land, the cash had to be secured by a first charge. Is that still so?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a somewhat complex question. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman about it, and pass copies of the letter to other hon. Members who may be troubled by the point.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon mentioned trust exemption clauses and the rights of creditors. As I said, the Lord Chancellor has referred those matters to the Law Commission. The hon. Gentleman referred also to challenges on costs, a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0686">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
matter brought up by several hon. Members. All costs of professional trustees can be challenged. First, the trustee would be entitled only to such costs as are reasonable in the circumstances. That is provided for under the Bill.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Christchurch observed that a solicitor trustee who was idling away his time during a low patch in conveyancing, might think it a nice idea to dust down a family trust, putting in a few billable hours to keep up his partners' monthly returns. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree (Mr. Hurst) that that is not how solicitors operate. If a solicitor did that, he would clearly be in breach of his duties as trustee, now codified in part I.<br><br>
I entirely agree with the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy that the proper route for challenge would be to seek a remuneration certificate from the Law Society for non-contentious business. In any event, the trustee would not be entitled to recover from the trust any more costs than were reasonable. Within the principle of cost law, proportionality is clearly established by the courts. In questioning whether the charges of an individual case were reasonable, I would not be the least bit surprised if the court, should the matter challenged under the Bill, or the taxing master, should it be challenged under the Law Society's procedures, considered carefully the scale of costs and asked whether the work done and the charges made were proportionate to the value of the trust fund.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Christchurch was quite right to say that professionals working for trusts have a duty to bear in mind that the principal obligation of trust funds is not to pay professional fees but to discharge the duties and fulfil the objectives of the trust. Keeping professional fees within proper limits and doing only work that is reasonable and necessary is therefore an important aspect of the duties of a trustee, whether he is a professional trustee who is a trustee of the board or someone engaged by the trustees to work on behalf of the trust.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon asked whether a mortgage granted by trustees to a beneficiary has to be a first mortgage. I shall write to him about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister leaves the point on challenging excessive fees—a matter to which we may revert in Committee—many Members are concerned that it deals not only with the position of solicitor trustees but of bank trustees, trust corporations and other professional trustees. Challenging the costs levied by such organisations is a cause of considerable concern.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to turn to that very point in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree. Everything that I have said and every provision in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
Bill that applies to professional trustees applies equally to trust corporations. Where a trust corporation is engaged to provide services on behalf of a trust, it has no greater right to impose unreasonable charges than any solicitor. I have spoken about the need for proportionality. The primary purpose of a trust is not to swell the profits of Barclays bank or any other trust corporation, but to carry out its duty with regard to the trust's purpose as laid down by the settlor, be that a charitable or any other trust purpose. That must be borne as much in mind by trust corporations as by any other trustee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hurst</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that in the case of a solicitor trustee, the mechanism for challenge is well and truly established through the application for remuneration certificate and through the professional rules and disciplinary processes of the solicitors' profession? Does the Minister agree that such straightforward and defined mechanisms do not exist to challenge overcharging by a bank or trust corporation, except in the terms of the Act by application to the court?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, but he may derive some comfort from clause 29(3), which defines the meaning of "reasonable remuneration" and refers expressly to
<br><blockquote><p>services by a trustee who is an authorised institution under the Banking Act 1987 and provides the services in that capacity, the institution's reasonable charges for the provision of such services.</p></blockquote>
That is a reminder to all trust corporations that the charges for the valuable work that they do must be reasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Garnier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Minister one further question relating to clause 42(4), which states:
<br><blockquote><p>this Act extends to England and Wales only.</p></blockquote>
We have all said how wonderful the Scottish Law Commission and the Law Commission of England and Wales have been in helping us to prepare for the Bill, and two members of the Committee represent Scottish constituencies. Does the Minister know whether an identical Bill will be presented to the Scottish Parliament or is there a lacuna in the Bill that needs to be addressed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer is speeding its way to me. A draft Bill for Scotland has been prepared, but the timetable for the introduction of that Bill is clearly a matter for the Scottish Executive. However, as the Bill is uncontentious and has received wide support in England and Wales, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman's words will be heard by the Scottish Executive.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p>Ordered,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee recommends that the Trustee Bill [<i>Lords</i>] ought to be read a Second time.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Committee rose at two minutes to Six o'clock.</i></p>
