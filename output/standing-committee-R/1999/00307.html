	<div class='page-header'><h1>Royal Parks (Trading) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Mr. Alan Howarth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That, during proceedings on the Royal Parks (Trading) Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at half-past Two o'clock.</p></blockquote>
I trust that the sittings motion is superfluous. I hope that we will speedily reach agreement on the principles of the Bill, if we have not already done so, and that we will complete Second Reading this morning. However, it is good for order and discipline that we have a sittings motion. I do not want to press the case for the motion, but I shall take the opportunity to say what a pleasure it is to proceed under your chairmanship, Mr. Jones, given your high reputation for scrupulous non-partisanship. Both of us, as hon. Members who represent Welsh constituencies, bring a suitable objectivity to the issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I particularly welcome the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) to his responsibilities on the Conservative Front Bench for the fields of culture, media and sport. I look forward to debating with him, and I know that we will explore—possibly with a touch of contention between us—the best outcomes for the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the sittings motion to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.31 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Greenway 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ryedale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reiterate the comments of the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Newport, East (Mr. Howarth). It is a great pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr. Jones. I state from personal experience that what the hon. Gentleman said about the independence and non-partisanship with which you chair proceedings is unerringly accurate. It is a pleasure to have you with us for what I, too, hope will be relatively speedy progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for his kind welcome. He will discover considerable unanimity today, not least in support of his wish that, despite the sittings motion, we should bring matters to a conclusion in the first sitting. However, I warn him that I am not sure whether such unanimity will continue when we debate other policy areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Maclennan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having heard the tributes paid to you this morning, Mr. Jones, I must add my own thoughts. I was reminded of Goneril and Regan being invited by King Lear to give their views, and of the thoughts of the third daughter, Cordelia, which were:
	<br><blockquote><p>What shall Cordelia do?</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Love, and be silent.</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Although she came to a sticky end, I will follow her example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That, during proceedings on the Royal Parks (Trading) Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at half-past Two o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee recommends that the Royal Parks (Trading) Bill ought to be read a Second time.</p></blockquote>
Bill is modest in length and has the single purpose of dealing with illegal trading, and its accompanying problems, in the royal parks. It will give my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, and the Royal Parks Constabulary, powers to deal with illegal trading similar to those which Parliament has given to Westminster city council in the City of Westminster Act 1999.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The royal parks are one of the glories of London. They are enjoyed by millions of people each year—local people, visitors from all over the United Kingdom and visitors and tourists from abroad. They are justifiably renowned. Visitors rightly expect to enjoy the open air in peace. They expect the highest standards of cleanliness and presentation which the Royal Parks agency strives with impressive success to provide and maintain. Visitors have a right to feel confident that anything—especially refreshments—offered to them for sale in the royal parks will be of a high quality and at a reasonable cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the responsibility of the Government to ensure that services in the royal parks are safe and clean. It is a responsibility which we take very seriously. That is why anyone who sells goods in a royal park must obtain permission to do so from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. Reputable firms are authorised to provide high quality refreshments in all the royal parks. They provide a valuable service to the public and part of their income goes towards the maintenance and upkeep of the royal parks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulations may be made under the Parks Regulation (Amendment) Act 1926 to secure the proper management of the royal parks and to preserve order and prevent abuses in them. The only regulations that are currently in force under the 1926 Act are the Royal Parks and Other Open Spaces Regulations 1997, which include a requirement that anyone wishing to trade in one of the parks listed in those regulations must obtain the written permission of the Secretary of State. If a person fails to comply with or acts in contravention of the regulations, including that for trading within the parks, he commits an offence under the 1926 Act. At present the court may impose a fine of up to £200 after conviction for such an offence. That said, fines, however frequently imposed by the courts, do not, as things are, act as an effective deterrent when compared with the income that can be gained from illegal trading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) and, I am sure, other hon. Members, know all too well what illegal trading means
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0667">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
in practice. Between spring and autumn the central royal parks—particularly St. James's park—are plagued by individuals operating carts from which they sell hot dogs or ice-cream in what I would describe, with some understatement, as unhygienic conditions. The unpleasant odour betrays their presence in the park from some distance away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These activities are taking place without permission. They are unregulated and uncontrolled. Exorbitant prices are often charged for food of dubious quality and freshness. Complaints by the public are often met with verbal abuse. These activities take place right up to the gates of Buckingham palace. They are a threat to the health of visitors, they tarnish—very visibly—the image of the royal parks, they undermine the legitimate business of authorised traders and they deprive the royal parks of much-needed income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that interviews by the immigration and social security authorities have elicited that many of those operating these food carts say that they are asylum seekers. It is apparent that they are being exploited by others who keep what we understand to be very considerable profits. Observations by park constables indicate that strong-armed methods are used to protect the interests of those who control this illegal trade. A prime location is not to be surrendered easily to a competitor. Knives have been drawn on occasions by rival operators. Royal parks constables have been attacked when they have tried to move the illegal traders out of a park.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not seeking in this Bill to introduce gratuitous bureaucratic control or a burden of unnecessary regulation on legitimate businesses and entrepreneurial enterprise; quite the opposite. We are seeking to protect the health and the pocket of the public, the pleasant surroundings of the royal parks and the interests of the authorised traders whose business and income are being undermined by illegal trading. We are seeking to provide effective means to deal with criminal activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole problem is not new but has worsened in recent years. As penalties increasingly failed to discourage illegal trading outside the royal parks, Westminster city council sought and obtained Parliament's approval for tougher measures. The main element of these is to allow Westminster city council to seize property used in the commission of unlicensed trading. That puts an immediate and effective stop to the illegal act. The court is also provided with enhanced powers. On conviction it may impose a fine of up to level 3, which is currently £1,000, and may determine whether any property relating to the offence is to be forfeited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The City of Westminster Act 1999 has already proved to work effectively—so effectively, in fact, that the consequence of the legislation has been to displace the illegal traders into the royal parks. I in no way criticise Westminster city council for its actions, which are both proper and effective. Parallel powers are now needed for the royal parks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now, therefore, to the specific provisions of this Bill. As I have indicated already to the Committee,
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
it creates various powers to regulate illegal trading in the parks and other open spaces covered by the Parks Regulation (Amendment) Act 1926. The powers in the Bill are broadly comparable to the powers provided to deal with unlicensed traders in the city of Westminster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 allows my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to designate particular provisions of any regulations made under the Parks Regulation (Amendment) Act 1926 "park trading regulations". This designation will be achieved by regulations made under the 1926 Act. Any failure to comply with a park trading regulation will, from then on, be a "park trading offence".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has four other main provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For park trading offences, it provides a penalty not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale. A level 3 fine, as we have just now noted, is currently £1,000. It provides a power of seizure by a constable of non-perishable items used in connection with illegal trading. It allows the Secretary of State, in specific circumstances, to retain and dispose of things seized. It provides a power to order forfeiture of things seized, exercisable by a magistrates court in the event of conviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of illegal trading in the royal parks has increased in recent years. It will continue to increase—with all its detrimental effects—unless the police and the courts have adequate, but fair, powers to deal with it. It is the purpose of this Bill to provide these and I commend the Bill to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Faber 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Westbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the next speaker, perhaps I could clarify for the Committee that the matter before us today is whether the Committee recommends that the Bill should be read a second time. The question
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Bill be now read a Second time</p></blockquote>
will be decided on the Floor of the House at a later date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.42 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Greenway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee is grateful for that clarification. This is certainly an unusual procedure. It is the first time that I have had the pleasure of sitting in a Committee that was to recommend to the House that a Bill be read a second time. We are used to doing it with statutory instruments. The attendance at the Committee here puts to shame that for what might be considered more weighty matters. I cannot recall seeing quite so many Labour Members, even during the long hours that the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan) and I spent along the Corridor on the Freedom of Information Bill. Whether it is an indication that they think it will be a brief procedure, or that they agree with the Government or that they have a strong view against it we shall shortly discover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to preface my remarks by saying that it was said in another place that the official Opposition supported the proposals that are in the Bill. We shall certainly support the question when it is put. The Minister said that the activities that we are seeking to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0668">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
outlaw were plaguing the royal parks. Personally, I am plagued by police matters. Having been shifted from home affairs to culture, media and sport, I hoped that I might have some respite. I was in the Metropolitan police for nearly five years in the 1960s before spending a long period as vice-chairman of the North Yorkshire police authority. I sat on the Select Committee on Home Affairs for 10 years and have been on the Conservative Front Bench dealing with police matters for almost two and a half years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that I had escaped the police, only to discover that the first matter to consider in my new brief is giving more powers to the Royal Parks Constabulary. However, I have a genuine interest in the matter. The first person that I arrested—late on a Saturday night in spring 1965—was a hot dog seller in Argyll street near the London Palladium.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sadly, that experience was to be repeated only too often. However, it taught me two things. First, and pertinent to the Bill, it taught me that fines are not a deterrent. In fact, in my experience, they become the accepted payment for being on a pitch. Secondly, the police do not have powers to seize hot dog stands. As a policeman, I always invited the vendor to bring his stall to West End Central police station, but that did not amount to a seizure. However, someone would take the vendor's place as soon as he was arrested and his stand taken to the police station. One of my colleagues would then go along and arrest the new vendor. Once, late on Saturday or Sunday night, there were 15 or more hot dog stands in the garage area of West End Central police station.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The phenomenon is therefore not new and I am sympathetic to those who say that the Royal Parks and the Royal Parks Constabulary need more powers to deal with the racket outlined by the Minister. Indeed, it is Parliament's job to provide such powers relatively speedily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I endorse the Minister's comments on food safety, especially smell. However, Committee members should consider a further aspect. Very often, unaccompanied children and young people purchase items from food stalls, paying rip-off prices for what is frequently an inferior product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what the Minister said about the image of our fine parks being tarnished. Those parks are a unique feature of the centre of London. However, whatever one feels about allowing licensed individuals to sell—[	<i>Interruption</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Greenway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Jones. No one is suggesting that people selling food on the streets should not be subject to some form of licensing. I accept what the Minister said about the Royal Parks and Other Open Spaces Regulations 1997, the Secretary of State's written permission and the need for those selling items from stalls in different parts of London to be properly supervised. Indeed, those who have examined such matters will be aware that some of these people are resorting to violence and are using threats and intimidation, as well as knives and other
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
offensive weapons. That behaviour has no place in the commercial life of Westminster and the City of London, and especially in the royal parks, where people expect peace and tranquillity. For all those reasons, Parliament must act. I agree with the Minister that the Bill should be read a second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I sit down, I wish to comment on two further points. First, the Minister referred to the City of Westminster Act 1999. One reason why the problem was not so prevalent in the royal parks was that these activities took place in the streets of the west end of London. Undoubtedly, that legislation has succeeded in displacing much of that activity into the parks. The Bill thus seeks to close the loophole created by that Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we agree with the Minister that it is sensible to provide the police and courts with powers to get at the people—described in the Bill as bodies corporate—who organise these activities to make vast profits from the exploitation of tourists, children and young people in the royal parks who buy these items. The Bill provides a valuable addition to the legislative framework.

I conclude by paying tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster, who has worked tirelessly to ensure that the Bill is passed. There may have been some difficulties with one or two of our hon. Friends, but that ensured that the measure would be passed as a Government Bill. The legislation reflects the seriousness of the problem. Extensive powers are being given to the Royal Parks Constabulary—powers of seizure, powers to act against bodies corporate and to impose heavy fines—so it is appropriate that they are approved in a Government Bill rather than a private Member's Bill in this or the other place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The official Opposition welcome the measure and wish it a speedy passage on to the statute book. We fully support the recommendation that the Bill be read a second time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Jenny Tonge 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Richmond Park)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to speak in the debate. I represent the only constituency named exclusively after a royal park, with nothing else added. It can lead to confusion on the part of journalists who assume that I represent the deer and no one else. I often wonder whether the deer in Richmond park fully appreciate that they have a Member of Parliament all to themselves. Thank goodness, I do not receive many letters from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problems dealt with by the Bill may well be greater in the central London parks than in Richmond park. However, they have arisen in Richmond, so my party and I are delighted to support everything in the Bill. The present fine of £200 is extraordinarily low for the offences involved. At the prices that vendors charge for hot dogs and ice-creams, that fine could be paid off in a couple of hours. It is well worth those vendors risking the fine and carrying on trading. The much more realistic sum of £1,000 is welcome, and the forfeiture of equipment is even more pertinent and important, although I notice that perishable items are

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
not included in the forfeiture, which is bad news for the foxes in Richmond park, which seem to multiply by the hour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have consulted the constables, the people in Richmond park and Mike Fitt, who is in overall charge of the royal parks. They totally support the Bill and cannot see it doing anything other than helping them in their task of keeping the royal parks free of traders. The only comment was, "For goodness' sake, don't talk too long or let anybody else talk too long; get the Bill through as fast as you can." Therefore, I shall stop now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leyton and Wanstead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Lady does not mind taking an intervention before she stops. She has made it clear that she supports the principle in the Bill of stopping illegal traders, as I do, but is she satisfied with the management and accountability of the Royal Parks agency and, indeed, the Crown Estate generally? I am thinking particularly about the almost secret £1.8 million grant that went to royalty to upgrade a home owned by the Ministry of Defence in Bagshot park, as one of her colleagues mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions should be brief and relevant. I remind the Committee that it would be helpful to be able to hear the debate. Conversations among those in sedentary positions are not allowed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady want more accountability in relation to the role of that management?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Tonge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a good point about accountability, but I do not see how we can possibly deal with that problem while we are discussing the Bill, which deals with a specific problem. I accept that questions are being asked about the management of the royal parks, but it is not appropriate to discuss those now. This is a good Bill, which is much needed, and it has the total support of local residents and people who work in the royal parks. Therefore I urge the Committee to proceed as quickly as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Brooke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cities of London and Westminster)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Jones.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a footnote to the intervention by the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, it was not recorded in the film "The Madness of King George", which was based on Alan Bennett's play, that when Lear was read aloud to George III, he interrupted, saying, "But all my daughters are Cordelias."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I have been seeking similar legislation for the past two and a half years, it would be churlish of me not to acknowledge the Government's graciousness in introducing the Bill. It would be equally churlish if I did not let bygones be bygones and help it to make maximum progress. Any references that I make to royal parks are to those in my constituency, and half
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
of them—Hyde park, St. James's park and Green park—are. I also have a tiny corner of Regent's park, which is primarily in the constituency of my parliamentary neighbour, the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck), but possibly also in Holborn and St. Pancras. I have a tiny corner in Park crescent at the northern end of my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale implied that the Bill was less important than the Freedom of Information Bill. The historical continuity of London is totally familiar to all those hon. Members present who served on the Committee of the Bill that became the Greater London Authority Act 1999. There is some repetition in London's history down the years. Just as we have problems with Canada geese in Green park, in the 1730s the geese in Kensington gardens caused considerable problems by picking up the gravel that was being laid outside Kensington palace. An aide-de-camp received rapid promotion up the military hierarchy for doing what the Royal Parks agency would find it more difficult to do in the current era: he simply shot the geese.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the reign of George II, barriers and obstacles were placed around the part of Kensington gardens adjacent to Kensington palace to keep out vagabonds, malefactors and miscreants. Although I am certain that the legislation did not specify Albanians, it is clear that such measures have been part of our history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Richmond Park alluded to the deer in her constituency. I am extremely proud of the fox that has recently appeared in the public prints and has eluded the Albanians. I was crossing St. James's park in the dark the other night and observed the fox disappearing into the bushes behind the public lavatories at the far end of the park. Therefore, that is where its earth may be. I report that for the benefit of any member of the Royal Parks agency who may conceivably be within earshot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the right hon. Gentleman observed the fox on the same occasion that my wife and I saw it. As we returned from the theatre and drove up St. James's street, we saw it emerging from Brooks's club.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the fact that Charles James Fox ran the entire Opposition to the Government of Pitt the Younger throughout the Napoleonic wars from a headquarters in Brooks's club—although he was good enough to propose Pitt for membership and Pitt was honourable enough to remain a member of Brooks's club until he died, even though the activities of His Majesty's Opposition were being conducted from the club throughout that period—I find it in no way surprising that another member of the fox family should have greeted the right hon. Gentleman, and quite right too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the right hon. Gentleman seen the answer that my hon. Friend the Minister gave on 9 November 1999 in which he stated that the nearest foxes live in the grounds of Lancaster house and under a portakabin in a Treasury building compound?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of that. I think that it was the portakabin fox that was filmed recently. The

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
photographer had to wait up eight nights in Downing street before he was able to take the picture. However, if I go too far down that line, Mr. Jones, you may deflect me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale said that the Bill was less important than the Freedom of Information Bill. Later in the 18th century than the events that I have so far described, freedom of information was taken up by Wilkes and such matters were largely fought out in this constituency. I say proudly that the royal parks exercised Parliament's attention earlier in the century. The Greater London Authority Act 1999 is also relevant because welcome amendments to it were agreed at a late stage. Perhaps those amendments were not so welcome to the Royal Parks agency as to those who reside around royal parks, given that the agency became subject to constraints on its traffic plans and must liaise with the local authorities surrounding the parks if it wants to change the regulations in the royal parks. The Bill represents a relief for the royal parks and is based on legislation that has worked well in Westminster, as the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale have said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to mention pollution. I was reassured by what the Minister said about the smell and the oil; it was clearly a personal expression of experience. There were moments during the period of procrastination when I wondered whether those smells had ever reached the nostrils of any member of the Administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a minor aspect of the Bill that is worth recording as one of its virtues—conservation. I declare an interest as the vice-president for my party of the London Wildlife Trust—a post that I earned as a result of a speech opening an international conference on conservation in public parks around the world. The conference was initiated by English Nature and the Royal Parks agency and my speech was sufficiently well received by the London Wildlife Trust members who were present that they asked me to become a vice-president. The former right hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes, Sir Jeremy Hanley, was my predecessor and so it has been kept very much in the royal parks family. Although the oil and smell cannot constitute a major setback to wildlife, plants and trees in the royal parks, it cannot but be a good thing that that threat to them should be removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.5 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I greatly welcome the spirit in which the measure has been debated. I am most grateful to those who have spoken for their willingness to recognise the nature of the problem and to acknowledge that the remedy that we propose is appropriate. I should like to pay my tribute to the Royal Parks Constabulary, which, equipped with less than adequate powers, has done its zealous best to ensure that this nuisance is kept to a minimum. It has been an impossible task, and the Committee is right to recognise that the constabulary needs our reinforcement and help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
I should also like to pay tribute to the Royal Parks agency for the high standards that it sets for the parks. It is enormously proud of the trust that is vested in it. My hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Mr. Cohen) touched upon matters of accountability. I agree that they are not really appropriate to be dealt with in this Committee. I would simply say that I am proud of what the Royal Parks agency achieves, frequently in difficult circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Faber</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of clarification, the Minister will know that on Sundays, the north edge of Green park along Piccadilly is used to host art displays and sales of souvenirs. It causes a great deal of traffic congestion and pollution. Will such vendors be affected by the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those traders are licensed by Westminster city council. For many people they are part of the pleasure of living in London at the weekend. I understand that the hon. Gentleman does not want the implication of his question to be that the traders should be prevented from doing what they do but that he simply seeks clarification. They are licensed by Westminster city council rather than by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster made a charming and learned speech, predominantly in the irenic spirit of Cordelia. A little mischievously, however, he alluded to procrastination. I cannot let that point pass. The problems that we have experienced in the royal parks had become all too apparent as early as 1995, in the period of the previous Administration of which he was a senior member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I just make the point? I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will wish to respond to it. I do not know whether the previous Administration were unwilling or simply unable to act upon the problem, but they failed to do so. From the moment that we took office we sought to act on that problem. We made it clear that that was our intention. I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Ryedale. A measure of this sort should be a Government measure. That is what we wanted it to be from the outset. Right hon. and hon. Members are political as realists and they will recognise that as a new Administration, coming into office with important manifesto commitments requiring legislation on health, education, law and order, social services, social security and so forth, we had to prioritise our legislative programme. We certainly would have liked to propose the Bill as a Government measure earlier, but the criticism that we should have done so is unwarranted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We made it clear to the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster that we would be more than enthusiastic to support him when he introduced a private Member's Bill, and we gave him every assistance with the drafting. In view of all his experience and authority as former chairman of the Conservative party and senior member of the Government Whips Office during the previous Conservative Administration, it is remarkable that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0671">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
his Bill failed to make progress. It happened because he was unable to control the antics of the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth), who scuppered the Bill. If the two right hon. Members had reached agreement, the Bill would have been on the statute book last year, which is what we hoped for. That did not happen, so we introduced the Bill as a Government measure at the earliest opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in a slightly difficult position, in light of the Minister's recent observations about keeping interventions short. I rose because he had implied that I was a member of the Conservative Administration in 1995. I wanted to point out that I left the Administration in 1994, before the problem became apparent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me briefly respond to what the Minister just said. In view of the manner in which my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst conducted his scrutiny of private Members' Bills, if, in November 1998, the Government had taken up the offer of Baroness Hooper and myself to introduce the Bill initially in the House of Lords and then in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
House of Commons, our chances of getting it through would have been much greater. My right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst did let through just such a Bill that started in another place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, it is water under the bridge now. If that point had been put to us with a little more lucidity, we might have been able to act on it. At all events, in the co-operative and cordial spirit of our affairs this morning, I am delighted to find that the measure has such a universal welcome. As the hon. Member for Richmond Park stressed, let us not hang about. We need the measure on the statute book as fast as we can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
