	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As this is the first meeting of the Regional Affairs Committee under the procedures set out in Standing Order No. 117—with which I assume all hon. Members are familiar—it may be convenient for hon. Members if I summarise the proceedings of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>To avoid confusion, I should be called either Mr. Chairman or Mr. McWilliam, not Mr. Deputy Speaker. Secondly, we shall begin with a statement from the Minister on the matter referred to the Committee by the House on 2 May. That will be followed by questions to the Minister on the statement, which may continue for up to an hour. We shall then move to the general debate on the matter referred to in a motion moved by the Minister; it is for her to decide whether to move that motion formally. Other hon. Members, including any sitting for English seats, not just the 13 core members of the Committee, will be called in the normal way until I call the Minister to wind up. At the conclusion of her speech, or at 4 o'clock, I shall put the question on the motion.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Steen	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Totnes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. Since the House will rise tomorrow and the Minister is sadly unlikely, even if she is returned, to be in her position after the election, is it appropriate for the Committee to sit this afternoon? It need not do so, because if no hon. Member were to stand up after I sit down, the Committee would adjourn. Do hon. Members feel it appropriate to fiddle while Rome burns? There are things to do outside; the campaign has started. Although we are, as always, delighted to see the Minister and it is a marvellous opportunity to quiz her because many things are happening in the regions—particularly in the south-west, which I represent, with all our foot and mouth problems—she could do nothing about such problems. If it sits, the Committee would be wasting its time, even though there are important matters to discuss. If no hon. Member gets up after I sit down, could the Committee adjourn until after the general election?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. J. Beith	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick-upon-Tweed)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I am confident that I can rely on you to protect the rights of members of the Committee, and of other hon. Members who sit for English constituencies, to put their concerns on the future of regional expenditure and other regional issues. If we were not allowed to proceed, we would be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
denied the opportunity of questioning some of the proposals for cuts in support for the regions, which the Conservatives announced this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, the Italian elections are nothing to do with us, so Rome is out of the question. Secondly, we are sitting at the direction of the House. Thirdly, I see a quorum before me, so there is no reason why we should not sit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.33 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Ms Beverley Hughes)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. I am delighted to see you in the Chair; I am sure that that augurs well for what I hope is an important and useful sitting of the Committee. I am delighted that the Committee has been re-established and I do not share the views of the hon. Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin by paying tribute to all my hon. Friends—Ministers and Back Benchers—and hon. Members in other parties who have, for many years and long before 1997, pressed the case for a strong regional dimension to economic and other policies. Some of those hon. Members are present as Committee members and others, including my right hon. Friends the Minister for Trade and the Deputy Prime Minister—who have long been strong supporters of the regional case and have ensured that it is a strong theme of the Government's policy—are not. Given the significant developments in regional issues over the past four years, it is important that developments specific to the English regions are discussed by a Committee along the same lines as the Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland Grand Committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the past four years, how to raise the economic performance of the English regions and deal with regional imbalances has been one of the Government's key priorities, although it has not always attracted the attention that we believe it deserves. There have been some considerable policy developments. That the matter is a priority springs from our firmly held belief that regionally led growth is not only desirable in its own right, but is an essential element of the drive to raise the economic performance of the nation as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we were elected in 1997, our priority for regional development in England was to ensure that the right framework could be put in place for regional economies to flourish in the future. We wanted to ensure that all regions of the country, including the best performing ones, have the opportunity to reach their full economic potential. I wish to put it on the record that, contrary to some press reports, the Government have never denied that there are economic differences between some parts of the north and south. Regional gross domestic product figures tell their own story. For example, within the United Kingdom, based on 1999 figures, gross domestic product per head in the north-east made a welcome increase to about £10,000, but that lags behind the United Kingdom average of £13,000 per head and the south-east figure of £15,000 per head. However, we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0222">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
cannot lose sight either of the fact that disparities in economic performance are, if anything, even more stark within some regions than they are between regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may come as a surprise to some people when they realise that the supposedly prosperous south-east of England barely scrapes above the European Union average for GDP. In fact, only London is comfortably ahead of that average and no one, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Regents Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck), needs telling that there are significant pockets of deprivation in the capital, too. That serves only to reiterate my point about economic imbalances being more pronounced within regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regional disparities are nothing new, yet no previous Government have seriously attempted to tackle the country's historical regional inequalities in a systematic and sustained way. Even in a period of growth, we know from history that it does not automatically follow that there will be a greater sharing of wealth throughout regions or communities. Areas that do not, for whatever reason, share in rising prosperity represent a huge waste of economic, human and social potential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to how the Government have dealt with such issues. In 1997, we started from the premise that we did not have all the answers. It was also clear that individual regions faced different problems and that no single solution could be applied throughout the whole country. We wanted to establish structures that ensured strategic decision making and accountability at regional and local level. We therefore set up regional development agencies and set them the tasks, first, of building up a shared understanding and consensus within each region of the challenges that they faced and, secondly, of developing a strategy to meet those challenges and to implement the vision. The Act that established the RDAs was passed in the Government's first parliamentary Session. Eight RDAs were set up in April 1999, followed by the London development agency in July 2000. The eight initial RDAs inherited £900 million from existing programmes, such as the single regeneration budget, the land and property budget, the skills development fund and the competitiveness development fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
RDAs are the building blocks for economic growth in the regions. They represent a bottom-up, rather than a top-down, approach and, as such, they are a form of economic devolution to the English regions. It is a major step for a United Kingdom Government to decentralise economic decision making in such a manner, and I hope that that will be seen as a positive commitment by us to the wider regional agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The RDAs have made an excellent start since their establishment only two years ago. As hon. Members wish to contribute to the debate, I shall merely offer a brief summary of their achievements. They have consulted with local partners to produce regional strategies that provide a focal point for regional economic development, and they have begun to establish a promising track record in the creation and protection of jobs—35,000 jobs were created or saved
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
in the first year. Their good start shows that they have the potential to establish lasting regional economic stability and growth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Their swift success was rewarded in the Chancellor of the Exchequer's spending review 2000, which introduced three major new measures. First, they were granted a substantial year-on-year increase in resources, from £1.2 billion for the present year to £1.7 billion in the 2003–04. Secondly, they were given more budgetary flexibility, which will lead to a single funding scheme in April 2002. Thirdly, they were given a strengthened economic regeneration role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision to allow RDAs maximum flexibility in the allocation of their resources is particularly significant. Their programmes will no longer be administered by three Departments—my Department, the Department of Trade and Industry, and the Department for Education and Employment. Instead, they and their local partners will be given the freedom to identify the overriding priorities of their regions and to allocate resources accordingly. They will be able to choose to spend more money on, for example, regeneration, training, or the promotion of business and enterprise. RDAs have therefore been given the tools to build on their success and to make an even greater difference in their regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I expect the RDAs to deliver on several key matters over the coming years: the promotion of competitiveness in their regions, including the development of clusters of innovation; the regeneration of brownfield land and buildings; the creation and protection of more jobs; the promotion of enterprise and business-led growth, and of other means of tackling deprivation and promoting social renewal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The counterpart of that greater freedom is that we are establishing challenging collective targets for the RDAs. In March 2001, we set out 11 targets that we expect them to achieve. Those targets are consistent with the public service agreements signed up to in the spending review 2000 by the three parent Departments—the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department for Education and Employment. RDAs will also be key players in the delivery of the measures set out in the urban and rural White Papers, and in the recent White Paper on enterprise and skills innovation that was produced by the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department for Education and Employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we develop economic policies that are regionally generated, we must ensure that there is local and regional accountability. In that vein, we have recognised the need for RDAs to respect the views and needs of the regions that they serve. To that end, we have encouraged the creation of voluntary regional chambers, to provide the main link between the RDA and the region. With the increased flexibility and resources that we have given to RDAs, the chambers' role has become more crucial than ever. That is why we announced £5 million a year for chambers to provide for the expanded scrutiny role that the new flexibility of RDAs requires the chambers to have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0223">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
The expanded role for the chambers could also take in regions' wider strategic activities and frameworks, such as regional sustainable development frameworks and regional planning guidance, which in turn incorporates regional transport strategies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a first step, by working together and providing joined-up governance for the regions, the RDAs, chambers and other partners such as Government offices have the potential to make a real impact on, and difference to, people's lives. That is what the matter is about, and why it is such a tragedy and an indictment that the hon. Member for Totnes is the only member of Her Majesty's Opposition who has taken the time to participate in the debate and share concerns about regions. I welcome the hon. Gentleman's presence, but it is a pity that today he is on his own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by restating the importance that the Government attach to regional development. It is not putting it to strongly to state that the matter is crucial to the future well-being of the whole country. By setting up RDAs, we have put in place the building blocks for better strategic co-ordination at regional level. We have delivered resources to the RDAs and given them the flexibility that they need to do the job. That has been a radical and fundamentally different approach—not one that simply tinkers at the edges of previous policies. The approach is also long term, and is aimed not at holding back the best performing regions to allow the others to catch up, but to get all our regions firing on all cylinders and widening the circle of winners, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry recently said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In short, we see RDAs as the strategic drivers of economic development in our regions, and therefore for the whole country. There is clearly some say to go before we can turn round several of our underperforming areas, but we are now better placed than ever before to achieve across-the-board growth, and thus ensure that we get all our regions performing to their full economic potential.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>I invite a gentleman Member to ask me on a point of order whether jackets may be removed, if only to put the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) out of his misery.</p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is always a great pleasure to represent my party, and today is no exception. I am a little disappointed that more of my colleagues are not here, but that is not surprising because they are not much in favour of regional government, and do not especially like regional development agencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a pleasure to see the Minister. The last time I had the pleasure of a debate with her was on the Floor of the House about my private Member's Bill, which, as she knows, was a tour de force and much needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is going on for rather a long time without asking a question. Will he please do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am known for being long-winded. I wind up a bit, and then ask a question at the end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is Question Time. The hon. Gentleman may be as long-winded as he likes when it comes to the debate, although he will be preventing others from speaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to prevent anyone from speaking. One of the reasons for my point of order was that I, unlike many colleagues, must fight the general election for a marginal seat and will therefore not be staying for the entire debate. I hope that the Minister understands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We last met on the Floor of the House a little while ago, and I should like to ask the Minister a couple of questions. The first relates to the voluntary chambers, or whatever they are called; they are called all different things all over the place. What is their status? I stumbled into a meeting at Exeter county hall and thought that I was in the Albert hall, as there were so many officials in the chamber. There must have been 200 or 300, all paid for by the taxpayer, and they all had prescribed questions. It was a talking shop. Everything was pre-rehearsed, and it did not do any good at all. Does the Minister believe that that is the way to proceed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, regional development agencies sound marvellous until they are presented with a problem. The south-west has had a major problem with foot and mouth, as the Minister knows. North Devon and Torridge and West Devon have been badly affected, as have some other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will comment on regional development agencies' ability to help small tourism businesses, especially in Dartmoor national park, which has in effect been closed for the past three months. There have been devastating results not only for the animals but for tourist operators, hoteliers, post offices and everyone else. The regional development agency needs to target its money now to help small businesses and tourist operators, and it is not doing so. I hope that she will agree and explain why, now that there is a genuine problem in the south-west in respect of helping small beer businesses, that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0224">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
cannot be done. The most that the Government have said that they can offer is £15,000 grants to small businesses in difficulties, but that does not go far, especially for hoteliers. Will she help me both on the question of regional voluntary chambers and on the failure of the regional development agency in the south-west to do what should be done immediately with regard to the foot and mouth problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I invite the Minister to reply, I advise hon. Members that questions are supposed to be questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members will testify that voluntary chambers have now been established throughout the country. Although they vary slightly, they tend to have a common membership that comprises representatives of the constituent local authorities, many voluntary organisations and some sections of the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As is the case with all such matters, voluntary chambers are evolving. As I have said, they have an important role to play in scrutinising RDAs, for which the Government have provided extra resources, enhancing their status in the scrutiny role that we hope that they will develop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regional co-operation that involves local authorities and other stakeholders is an important counterweight to the agencies, so it is important for those chambers to be active and effective and to represent and provide a conduit for all stakeholders to scrutinise what is going on and to have a say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the developments that we have witnessed during recent months, following the foot and mouth outbreak and the unfortunate job losses announced in some areas, is the ability of a strategic regional body to act much more quickly in bringing people together, identifying key areas and mobilising the various partners that need to be mobilised in order to develop and implement a recovery plan. The RDA for the south-west, was one of the first, if not the first, to put together a taskforce that brought together the local authorities, farmers, landowners and tourist industry representatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has not done anything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The RDAs have done some things. Last week, I was in Cornwall to examine the problem of foot and mouth. Without any prompting from the Government, the RDAs have put £8 million of their own resources, along with £2 million of EU money, into a starter fund specifically to help non-farming businesses. Since then, my Department has provided £15 million, and my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment announced an extra £24 million this week. Those funds are being channelled through the RDAs because they are best placed to identify the precise problems in each region. The problems are many and varied. Those experienced in the south-west are unlike those in other parts of the country, where the manifestation of foot and mouth has been very different. To have agencies at that level is a strength. They can mobilise partners and respond to crises in a localised and sensitive way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is good to see you here today. I also welcome the Minister on this historic occasion. Some of us would argue that, when Standing Order No. 117 was formulated by the House, there was a desire that the business of the Committee should be brought forward urgently. Will the Minister explain the reason for the obvious delay?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my part of England, Yorkshire, there is a growing and enthusiastic demand for regionalism, intervention and a proactive approach to the Government's economic policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share my hon. Friend's impatience at the delay—	<i>[Interruption.]</i>—although that is obviously not shared by all parties in the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hon. Members must not heckle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share my hon. Friend's frustration. To put the matter in perspective, the Committee was established in 1975. It met approximately 13 times, the last of which was in 1978. There was a long period— throughout the Tory Administration—of no interest at all in the Committee, or in the regions as an important perspective to feed into policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my statement, I outlined what has happened since 1997. We established the RDAs in the first parliamentary Session. I hope that my hon. Friend will agree that we acted precipitously to do that. The RDAs had been set up, but in April 1999 they were still embryonic. They had first to develop an economic strategy, which took some time, and they have effectively been going for little more than a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that my hon. Friend will understand that we have had a great deal of difficulty. He knows that the re-establishment of the Committee was strongly resisted by the Opposition. In re-establishing the Committee, my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House tried to obtain consensus to ensure that the Committee is attended and endorsed by all parties, and she spent a great deal of time trying to achieve that. That is the main reason for the delay between the order last April and the first meeting today. It is a pity that we have not been more successful in achieving more active participation, but I share my hon. Friend's view that we could wait no longer and it was important that we meet today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, I did not mean to heckle—it was an involuntary expression of amazement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The right hon. Gentleman was not the hon. Member to whom I referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was unable to stop myself expressing amazement that the Conservative party should completely abandon the discussion on the affairs of the regions, such as the one that you and I represent, Mr. McWilliam, in the north-east of England—not to mention the south-west and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister recognise that the most disadvantaged regions need a higher level of public expenditure on essential services to compensate for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
that disadvantage and become economically successful? Scotland has done that to a significant extent through the Barnett formula. Does she recognise that such a formula, if applied to the English regions, and the creation of a mechanism to set it up, could make a profound difference?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister accept figures, such as those used in early-day motion 618, tabled by the hon. Member for Blyth Valley (Mr. Campbell), who is present in the Committee, which illustrate that, in many areas of public service, expenditure in Scotland is at least 20 per cent. higher than in the north-east of England, for example, and in some areas higher still. Industry spending is £171 per head compared with £119 in the north-east, and tourism spending is £5.85 per head compared with 16p in the north-east. Does she admit that such disparities exist and see them as a handicap? Are the Government prepared to reform the Barnett formula so that all parts of the country—Scotland, Wales and the regions of England—have a basis that reflects their needs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman knows from previous statements by other Ministers that no plans exist at present to review the workings of the Barnett formula. The Government believe that that formula is the best available means of fairly distributing public spending throughout the United Kingdom. It simply determines changes in existing block budgets on the basis of population in the different countries; it does not determine the total allocation for each devolved Administration. Over time—I accept that it may take some time—the formula should lead to relative convergence of spending per head between England and the rest of the United Kingdom. The Barnett formula began when there existed historically different patterns of expenditure, representing the different issues in terms of delivering public services in the different countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have allocated sums of money to deal with the relative deprivations and inequalities and the need to regenerate communities to which the right hon. Gentleman referred. That money comes from outside the mainstream public spending blocks. In many instances, the most disadvantaged communities in all the English regions have received that additional money through the neighbourhood renewal fund, the new deal for communities grants and those other special grants specifically targeted at our most deprived localities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Louise Ellman	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Liverpool, Riverside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome the Minister's statement, and especially the comment that the great achievements of the Government are only first steps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have several specific questions. What Government machinery exists to ensure that all Departments are working towards a regional agenda? Is the Minister satisfied that the Department for Education and Employment is a convert to regionalism and that the budgets of the learning and skills councils are sufficiently devolved to allow regional skills and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
training needs to be taken into account and fully developed? How does she reconcile the Government's commitment to devolution to the regions with the Arts Council's apparent decision to centralise and abolish its regional arts boards? Does she agree that the powers given to regional chambers, whose increased budgets are to be welcomed, would have greater legitimacy if those assemblies were directly elected, allowing for the retention of voluntary and private sector involvement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend, who has been a strong supporter of and protagonist in the regional agenda, asks several questions. I know that she wants further progress to be made towards directly elected regional governments and that she has been active in supporting that process in her region and in Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On my hon. Friend's first question, all Departments are expected and, I believe, are striving to ensure that all their policies include a strong regional perspective. One testimony to that is the role of the new regional co-ordination unit, which will pull together regional Government offices. As all Departments are moving towards having representation in those Government offices, that will be a mechanism whereby we can ensure that all Departments at Whitehall level have a strong regional presence, and that, through the RCU, there is a strong regional connection with the RDAs and assemblies. The tripartite structure of assemblies, RDAs and Government offices is important in ensuring that the feedback to Whitehall has a strong regional perspective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On budgets and learning and skills councils, I accept that the relative responsibilities of RDAs and the councils must be worked out. Clearly, RDAs have a strong role in identifying the skills deficits and needs of businesses in terms of different skills in their areas. The LSCs focus on ensuring that those skills gaps, so identified, are delivered on, and that will be reflected in budget allocation. Currently, I have no reason to suspect that the budgets of LSCs have not been devolved sufficiently. The picture is evolving, however, and we must undertake close consideration to ensure that there is a connection between the identification of skills gaps and delivery in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge my hon. Friend's point about the Arts Council decision not to have regional arts boards. Our focus on regional perspectives and structures requires us to examine the implications of that focus and the link with regional structures. Such linkage has been important—for example, in relation to the tourism industry during the recent foot and mouth crisis—and the role of regional arts boards has been significant in terms of raising some relevant issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On regional government, I can tell my hon. Friend that, as she will be aware, the Deputy Prime Minister has reaffirmed our position. I cannot pre-empt our manifesto, which I understand will be published next week, but I am fully aware that the national policy forum document endorses our position, which is that, as soon as is practicable, we shall move to directly elected regional government, when and where there is a clear demand for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
Our policy document suggested requesting regional chambers to develop proposals in their respective regions—those proposals might be different—and publishing a Green or White Paper on regional government, which would set out how we propose to take the matter forward. That remains our position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Karen Buck 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Regents Park and Kensington, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I warmly welcome not only the general thrust of the Minister's statement, but her reference to the impact of sub-regional patterns of deprivation, which, as she knows, is a subject dear to my heart. As a London Member, I know that, alongside a strong and successful economy in London, there are serious problems. My leafy-sounding constituency of Regents Park and Kensington, North has the 14th highest claimant count in England, and the seventh highest eligibility for free school dinners. Indeed, London is the region with the largest number of constituencies ranked in the top 50 in terms of percentage unemployment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister agree that the existence of those pockets of deprivation will not only have a deleterious social effect, but will undermine economic performance and could act as brake on London's ability to be one of the economic engines of the country? Can she assure me that future allocations via the single pot regeneration budget will recognise those complex patterns of sub-regional deprivation? Will she be open to further representations on refinements to the multiple deprivation index, so that we can ensure that resources are directed where they are most needed, not only to provide a social benefit for residents, but to enable them to take part in our economy and to contribute to further economic success?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we are moving towards flexibility in the single pot budget. The allocation in this year's budget will be made on the basis of 80 per cent. formula and 20 per cent. discretion. The formula is largely driven by indices of unemployment and deprivation, which will continue to pertain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that my hon. Friend has strong feelings about the index of deprivation, but she and her colleagues will accept that, in revising it, we recognised that deprivation is not always urban centred. We need a definition that recognises the serious problems in many other areas, such as ex-coal mining, rural and coastal areas, and seaside towns. The constellation of problems and the particular manner in which deprivation manifests itself in such areas were not acknowledged in the previous index. However, the index continues to represent the kinds of urban deprivation that are evident in her constituency and about which she is concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Wyatt 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sittingbourne and Sheppey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My question to the Minister is about venture capital. At national level, one of the most successful venture capital groups is the Prince's Trust, which has been very effective in assisting start-up companies. It has an expertise that does not exist at RDA level. What discussions has she had with the trust to tap its expertise? My community has a vibrant chamber of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
commerce. We continually wonder why most of the successful business men and women in the chamber are not part of discussions at RDA level and are not tied into that economic presence. They, too, could help with venture capital.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot answer my hon. Friend's question about the discussions that have taken place with the Prince's Trust. However, I am confident that officials in my Department or the Department of Trade and Industry have been involved in such discussions, and I commit myself to writing to him with precise information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the general point, the White Paper on enterprise, skills and innovation published recently by the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department for Education and Employment discussed a key role for RDAs as channels for venture capital funding to encourage business formation and growth in all the regions. The Small Business Services operates a £75 million incubator fund in conjunction with the RDAs, for example, and there are other important measures to promote new businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned business women. A significant number of women start new businesses and do well, but we still lag far behind other parts of the world, particularly North America. With other groups, RDAs could target sectors of the community that we do not traditionally think of in connection with business start-ups—for example, women and minority ethnic groups—and provide specific assistance with venture capital. We must provide resources to help with start-ups for such businesses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Cousins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. McWilliam, for allowing me to ask a question. I am not a full member of the Committee, but I want to place it on record that this is an important moment for some of us. You, my hon. Friend the Member for Blyth Valley and I count ourselves among a group of north-east Labour Members who pressed for the revival of the Committee. We thank the Government for arranging that, albeit at the end of this Parliament, and for the promise of much more to come in the next.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition, who, in the form of the hon. Member for Totnes, have left the Committee, have announced that they seek the abolition of regional development agencies. How much would that mean in respect of spending in the north-east of England? Regional development agencies were carefully and painstakingly built up and they have a body of experience and expenditure behind them. I am worried that they might simply be wiped out, and the problem would be not only lack of money, but the opening up of a gap in the delivery of important regeneration and improvement programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answering my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman), the Minister suggested that legislation to permit referendums in regions, which could trigger a move to democratically elected regional government, might be considered early in the next Parliament. Will she advise us about that possibility?

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
The right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) referred to the Barnett formula. I recommend an equivalent formula for England—the Hughes formula, perhaps—so the Minister's name might live for ever. Long after the Prime Minister and Chancellor are forgotten, debates would take place on the Hughes formula, which, I hope, might commend itself to her. The Barnett formula, however, is structured around the territorial block allocation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee is supposed to be asking questions, but the hon. Gentleman is making debating points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In respect of the answer to the question put by my hon. Friend the Member for Riverside, will the Minister consider the possibility of providing a territorial block allocation to English regions on the same basis as that which has operated in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for more than 70 years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position of the Tories is to abolish not only regional development agencies, but regional chambers and the Government offices, even though they created them. They are obviously keen to have no structures in our English regions, nor do they recognise the significance of what we are debating— regional imbalances and the importance of improving the economy in each region, which will in turn contribute to driving up the national economy as a whole. The policy of the Conservatives is clear: they do not like regions and they would do nothing to help them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The net budget for One North East RDA this financial year is a little short of £150 million, so the region would lose at least that amount, but we all know that such funds are largely pump priming money, which generates more money through investment, project development and job creation. The full value of the amount lost to my hon. Friend's region would therefore be much greater and would impact more significantly on the north-east.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have yet to decide the detail of our approach to the policy, but our fundamental position is clear: we remain committed to directly elected assemblies when people in the regions want them and then vote for them in a referendum. Later this year, subject to the election, we shall publish a Green Paper setting out the proposals, but I can tell my hon. Friend no more than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that the Hughes formula has quite the same ring to it as the Barnett formula. I understand my hon. Friend's point and his strength of feeling, but the Government have no plans to change the formula and he and his colleagues will have to keep pressing if they want change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Great Grimsby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's statement and the first sitting of the Committee, belated though it is. We are taking a big step because regionalism will be the major issue of the next Parliament, as devolution was the major issue of this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
The matter is not stationary, as regionalism and devolution are a process that needs to move forward, and I pay tribute to my right hon. Friends the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade for driving it forward so effectively. Furthermore, I welcome the establishment of the regional development agencies, but, given that so many jobs have been taken on by the RDAs, the funding will almost certainly be inadequate. There are regional disparities in public spending to which hon. Members have alluded. Public spending per head is £5,271 in Scotland, but only £4,224 in Yorkshire and Humberside, which is £1,000 less, even though the problems of unemployment, deprivation and industrial decline are worse than in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister say what plans the Government have in that respect? Now that the Conservatives have left the Room she is among friends, and I hope that she will elaborate. Will the Government increase allocations to the RDAs and even up the anomalies, not by dragging Scotland down, but by boosting regional spending?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As to RDA spending, as I said in my opening statement, the RDAs' initial budget, which comprised the streams that they inherited, was about £900 million. We have already increased that substantially. The budget for this financial year represents a 15 per cent. increase on the budget for the previous financial year. There is a total of £1.3 billion for this financial year, which is a substantial increase on £900 million, and, as a result of increases built into the spending review, that will rise to £1.7 billion in 2003–04. The Chancellor provided for substantial year-on-year increases in the RDAs' budget to tackle the issues facing them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise what I said about the Barnett formula and what my hon. Friends consider to be disparities between the English regions and the other countries in the kingdom. I know that I am among friends, but I am not yet Chancellor of the Exchequer, and I regret that I cannot go further than I have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ronnie Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blyth Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Northumberland has four Members of Parliament. Three of us are in the Committee Room—only the Tory is missing—and we have a case to press.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Barnett formula has been mentioned, and I asked Lord Barnett about why it was introduced. It began because Scotland was having a rough time and was fairly run down, so it needed extra spending. In those days, we were great socialists, so we did not mind the Scots receiving extra money to bring things up to scratch, but unfortunately the formula has continued for 22 years. What my hon. Friend the Minister says about my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer is right, but he is a Scottish MP. I mention that in passing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask the Minister about standard spending assessments. In Northumberland, we always get a bad deal. In particular, headmasters and headmistresses do not receive enough money for their schools. We are not on a par with most of the country and we always receive less than the average, because of the way in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0228">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
which local government spending is formulated and the imbalances of SSAs. For many years, my hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck (Mr. Murphy), the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed and I have pressed for a review, which has been almost as hard as trying to have the Barnett formula reviewed. There is an imbalance, and it is bad for Northumberland. I do not know how the formulas work—we would need to be rocket scientists to understand them—but are there plans to take action on SSAs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will agree that, although my right hon. Friend the Chancellor represents a Scottish constituency, he is Chancellor for the United Kingdom. I am sure that most of my hon. Friends accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand my hon. Friend's point about SSAs, and many Members throughout the country have made similar ones. We have recognised for some time that the SSA formula needs to be changed and we would have changed it earlier had we achieved any consensus among local authorities about the direction in which it should go. Although we have not achieved that consensus, we are committed to reform, as my hon. Friend knows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister repeated yesterday at Prime Minister's questions, we are committed to publishing a White Paper in October. Work is going on in my Department and all Departments that contribute to the SSA blocks through spending. We are seeking a way to change the system radically, so that it does not depend on the formulas that create perversities in outcomes, but reflects the different needs in different areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot give my hon. Friend any detail about the White Paper's content, but I can say that we are working on it. Officials will continue to work on it during the summer and we hope to produce it in October. I hope that it will deal with some of the legitimate concerns that he has raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take my hon. Friend back to her opening remarks? I think that she referred to building blocks for regional regeneration and a new economy in England's regions. I do not know whether I should declare an interest, but I am a civil engineer and I must tell her that we need to put the foundations in place before the building blocks. One of the most important aspects of building a new economy in my part of the world—Yorkshire and one of its most peripheral areas, Scarborough and Whitby—is the desperate need for transport infrastructure renewal, investment and a far more proactive approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to know how the Government propose to achieve accountability, particularly for transport infrastructure improvements, so that areas such as mine can achieve an enhancement of the A64 corridor, of which I know the Minister is aware. We must ensure that a peripheral area such as Scarborough and Whitby do not lose out because it is 42 miles from a major conurbation. There have been major job losses
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an important point because transport infrastructure is an essential factor in economic development. That is why my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister announced significant additional investment in transport, and returned decision making on priorities to regional and local initiatives and transport planners through regional development agencies and the assemblies. I hope that my hon. Friend agrees that this is an evolutionary process and that we are beginning to devolve down to the regions not only big economic questions, but related issues such as draft planning guidance, and regional and local transport strategies. That is important because, if we want to achieve our objectives in regional economic strategies, we must devolve decision-making and priority-setting powers on infrastructure matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That evolution seems to be going in the wrong direction, although one of my most intriguing recent experiences was sitting in the Gallery of the Scottish Parliament, observing a former Conservative Member of this House arguing that the Scottish Parliament should not allow Westminster to legislate for it on one matter. That former Member had opposed the creation of the Scottish Parliament and its electoral system, without which no Conservatives would have been elected. The hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Austin) might be right, and there is always the prospect of the repenting sinner and of political evolution, but there is not much sign of that today.

I had the duty this morning of reading the Conservative party election manifesto. Those who read it will see that the regional development agencies that we have debated, and just about everything else in the regions, are proposed as a source of savings. Such bodies would be abolished to pay for other commitments. Indeed, the regional assemblies that have not yet been created or paid for are also supposed to be a source of savings. Not only the money that the regions have now, but any that they might hope to get in the future is earmarked to be taken away—from some of the most deprived areas of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is dear to the heart of my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. George) and I pass on his apologies to the Committee. He has suffered a significant family tragedy with the death of his brother; otherwise he would have been here to put the strong Cornish case on behalf of the lowest wage area. His area shares many of the problems that we have in north-east England and he, too, feels keenly the need for an effective institution to serve his and other regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the disappointing stories that the Government have to tell in this election campaign is that their aspirations for the regions have not been met. We were glad to work closely with them on the setting up of the Scottish Parliament, which we sought to shape in the way that we thought important. It was a fruitful co-operation. However many complaints the people of Scotland may make now, if they were asked to vote on the matter, they certainly would not vote to have their Parliament taken away from them. Parliaments are not, by definition, popular, but taking the Scottish one away would incur the wrath of the majority of the Scottish people. It has clear opportunities to serve Scotland, which it carries out, as well as other advantages that I turn to now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I start with the Barnett formula. Those who argue that a funding formula for the regions is needed do not argue that Scotland should be punished for having had the Barnett formula. In so far as a needs case can be represented for expenditure levels in Scotland and for a Scottish block to be a particular size, that case can be made. Indeed, the proper place for doing that is a commission for the financing of the nations and regions of England, which could determine how the block is distributed on objective criteria, related to need. The creation of a body that would match the claims of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland with those of the different regions of England seems a sensible way of proceeding. Perhaps it could become known as the Hughes commission, if the Minister were to put her weight behind it. Some such body is needed to make that allocation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) about the need for a block basis of funding for the regions, not just in principle but in practice, because it would allow the regions, as it now allows Scotland, to decide on priorities. They are sometimes difficult decisions, such as whether to spend more on one thing and less on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
another. My colleagues in the Scottish Parliament have made a commitment to fund personal care for the elderly, which they rightly regard as a high priority. That commitment will have financial implications, which will have to be resolved within the Scottish budget. It is quite right that it should be so resolved. We should like to make choices like that about priorities in our various regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lack of progress on this matter is depressing. I respect those Labour Members who have clearly and forcefully argued that case. My hon. Friends and I will argue with them until we get a system that takes account of the genuine needs of disadvantaged regions. Short of some economic miracle or fluke, those regions cannot be expected to overcome their disadvantage so long as their infrastructure, their main public services, their education or their health service are behind other regions. Unless unexpected industry arrives in the way that the oil industry arrived in Shetland many years ago, the disadvantage will remain. A transformation cannot be achieved without a basic change in the funding formula.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Blyth Valley (Mr. Campbell) pointed out, other funding formulae affect regions badly too. Certainly in Northumberland and Durham, and some other parts of the country such as Somerset, the local government formula is a serious handicap. Regional businesses that are trying to develop their potential require well-educated young people. The same standards of education for our children are expected nationally, but the funding levels available for that are weirdly different. I use the word "weirdly" because they do not correspond precisely to areas where one can show that there is a particular problem, such as a high proportion of children whose first language is not English. That is a specific need and we would all agree that some provision must be made for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other differences between Westminster or Kensington and Northumberland or Somerset are not explained by that and leave schools in those areas at a terrible disadvantage. Business people always stress that what comes out of the education system is vital to their potential. The present local government formula is the one set up by the Conservative Government. It is depressing that, after four years of a different Government, we still have the same formula and are still talking about whether we can do something about it. Dealing with it should have been a priority. The Government are tying their hands behind their back by going into an election in our part of the world without having resolved that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have liked more progress on regional assemblies. Rather than sitting around waiting for the Government to make progress, some regions, particularly the north-east and Yorkshire, are following the example of Scotland and working together. It is very important to note that various interests in the regions are getting together to set the agenda for developing democratic regionalism. Such regionalism should not be imposed by central Government. It is born of a desire in the regions for accountability on the part of existing Government
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0230">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
officers and activities, and for the opportunity to improve regional governance by making real choices. Much more in Scotland than in Wales, that was achieved through a convention and the coming together of various groups to establish the nature of the Scottish Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Wales, the process was much more hasty, and as a result the vote on the creation of the Welsh Assembly—of which I was strongly in favour—was extremely narrow. Unlike in Scotland, where real advantage was taken, in Wales the wrong approach was taken to the development of regional government. We in the north-east are trying to follow Scotland's example. The Churches, the trade unions, business, community organisations and political parties are all talking to each other about how to make regional government effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By providing the necessary mechanism and giving people a choice in a referendum, the Government would be responding to an existing desire in the regions. I welcome the fact that the Minister has underlined today that that remains a Labour party commitment, but I am disappointed at the progress made during this Parliament. Regional government is a high priority for my party. After the general election, we shall use all the power at our disposal to enable people in those English regions where there is a real interest in regional government to cast their vote on the establishment of a regional assembly. We must present an attractive package that offers real powers and real competence, that embraces existing Government bodies—rather than leaving them without regional accountability—and that has a fair voting system. I am certain that the Scottish Parliament would not have succeeded without a fair voting system. It enabled people to feel confident that one party or one region would not dominate the Scottish Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of regional assemblies is also important in relation to other levels of government. It is important in terms of the European Union, which is crucial to the success of disadvantaged regions. Like a German Land, a regional assembly could represent itself in Europe and win arguments on behalf of its region. At the moment, such opportunities do not exist, although we try our best through our regional offices in Brussels. The offices are sometimes criticised, but they are necessary because they provide funding and opportunities for the regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is becoming clear that, despite all the difficulties and weaknesses in the system, London government allows London to challenge central Government. An interesting and rather difficult argument about the future of the tube is taking place between London government and central Government. We all have views about that, but it is important to note that the north lacks the robustness that enables London to participate properly in that argument. Most of those who might conduct such an argument on behalf of Yorkshire or the north-east are civil servants, who are employed by the Government. They cannot challenge the Government in the manner of the hon. Member for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone), or Bob Kiley. The ability of a region to speak for itself is greatly affected by the existence of an assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it is generally recognised by the Government that one of the most important ways to enable the regions to prosper is to ensure the necessary infrastructure, such as transport, support services and telecommunications. Infrastructure is crucial, and decisions about such priorities are a matter for the regional assemblies. It is regional assemblies that must talk to business. They must listen to what business says about matters such as freight services and road communications, without which the regions cannot develop. In Northumberland, an important infrastructure development would be Al dualling; in other parts of the country, an altogether different project might be necessary. We must have the opportunity to allocate money to priorities on the basis of regional decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to discuss two more issues, both of which have already been mentioned. The first is that of regional arts boards. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan) said last week in a debate in Westminster Hall, the need for a regional level of decision making in the arts is recognised in just about every region. Nobody who works at that level can see any sense in the highly centralised structure that would emerge if we did not have regional arts boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second matter is the regional effort that is being made to deal with foot and mouth and its impact, which was mentioned during the brief stay of the hon. Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen). Scotland has scored in that regard. The capacity of government in Scotland to act in a co-ordinated way has been demonstrated by their handling of the foot and mouth outbreak and its aftermath and consequences. Obviously, they have the advantages of smaller scale, but so would a regional assembly. I pay tribute to the government officers, including the head of the Government office for the north-east, who are working at the foot and mouth emergency centre in Newcastle. They have a tremendously difficult job and are putting a tremendous amount of effort into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must recognise the regional significance of what has happened and the despair of many people—not only in farming, although there is plenty of despair there, but in businesses associated with farming and tourism—about the situation that they now face. That is especially true of people in the tourism industry. Those who have invested in hotels see no match at all between what is available through regional tourist boards and the scale of the losses that they are sustaining. I recently spoke on the phone to a hotelier in my constituency who had invested in a hotel within the past 12 months. Almost all his customers are walkers, and those who are not come to events such as motorcycle rallies, which have been cancelled this year. Many people have had only a tiny fraction of the business that they would normally expect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tourist board resources are barely sufficient to mount an effort to counteract the publicity that has been generated by foot and mouth by issuing an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0231">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
invitation to people to come to the region. The resources that are available are helping to deal with the problem, but are insufficient to compensate the businesses that have suffered. The Government must channel more resources into the regions that have been drastically affected by foot and mouth, which is still raging in Northumberland as new cases continue to appear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Committee is no kind of answer to the issue of effective democratic government in the regions and scrutiny of that government. Indeed, it has been made available to us only on the last possible day before the dissolution of Parliament. However, that is no reason not to take the opportunity, as hon. Members have done, to raise our concerns and to put them firmly in Ministers' minds. All those of us who hope to be back here after the general election intend to pursue these matters vigorously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have a background in engineering and, when I made my maiden speech on first entering Parliament, I talked about landslides and problems with failure. My experience as a professional engineer taught me that one should take as proactive an approach to the economy as one would take, say, to a major piece of earthworks. If one maintains and tends the feature properly, the garden will flourish and one will have a successful crop. If one does not tend and maintain the garden or have a proactive approach to it, one faces a harvest failure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The policy of regionalism is similar to that problem. Last week, I received a phone call from a major private employer in my constituency. A large factory was closing and one in 20 of the work force would face redundancy—a bleak prospect. Without the help of the Department of Trade and Industry, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and all the good forces that the Government have put in place, the ambulance would not have come to that awful, bloody accident that, potentially, could cripple the people of Scarborough and Whitby. I refer to the closure of the Plaxton bus factory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is vital that we grab this agenda in the next Parliament. We must take it and score a try—a reference that my hon. Friend the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Mr. Wyatt) will appreciate from his rugby days. We need to score for our regions and ensure that our communities participate fully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
I should like to mention the areas of economic activity in my constituency. Scarborough is known for tourism, of which there are two types: coastal and rural. I commend the excellent work carried out by my hon. Friend the Minister in recognising the inequalities in the coastal communities around the country. Without that intervention, my constituency and other coastal constituencies would not have received the assistance that they have over the past four years. We would be facing a bleaker future had a proactive approach not been taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rural tourism in my constituency involves a national park. I want to associate myself with the comments of the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed, who identified the problems that face rural constituents in relation to national parks and the tensions and conflict between the farming community and rural hoteliers and the tourism industry. Such problems manifested themselves during a recent visit from my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. We need a framework, a dialogue and a mechanism for a proactive approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our fishing industry is also related to tourism. My hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby and I know too well that we desperately need a more proactive approach to the fishing industry in Yorkshire and the Humber. Through a regionalised approach, we can enhance, remarket and reinvent the fishing industry in the North sea, in tandem with the work that must be done on a pan-European basis. Many of Yorkshire's remoter communities have a struggling manufacturing industry. There has been a lack of research and development, and a lack of positive reskilling, retooling and retraining of the work force. Such problems will not be dealt with by the policies of the Conservative party, who are not here— like their policies, they are invisible. They offer nothing for the people of Scarborough and Whitby. Members of the community in the Eastfield area of Scarborough face the prospect of long-term redundancy. They are 42 miles from the nearest alternative source of work, and I would fear for their future were it not for the regionalised approach taken thus far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need vitality and an agenda with which we can proactively move forward when Parliament reassembles. I hope that all hon. Members who reassemble after the general election will be at the forefront of the arguments, the scrutiny and the process. I commend the excellent work done by my right hon. Friends the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade. I have worked as an individual member of the Labour party and a trade unionist for nearly 20 years and have tried to support the notion of regionalism and devolution. It is vital for my community and region, and I hope that the Committee will fully and wholeheartedly endorse the proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

for the south-east; today, we are looking at broader regional economic disparities. I hope that our worth as a Committee will be measured by the action that emanates from discussions such as today's and the facts that we are able to bring out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall comment briefly, about the north-west in particular. The facts about relative economic disparity and deprivation affecting the north-west are well known. Although in terms of population we are the largest region outside London and the south-east, in terms of gross domestic product per head we are seventh out of nine English regions. On the regional competitive index, we are, again, seventh out of nine; on the index of knowledge-based business we are fifth out of nine; and we have a low level of business formation and retention. Those factors have a widespread impact, which is shown in part in continued population movements and in the intensification of existing regional disparities. It is estimated, for example, that in the next seven years, 8,000 people will leave the north-west and that more than 12,500 will go to the already overheated south-east. Economic disparities lead to conditions that will continue those disparities unless steps are taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, the north-west faced a watershed that showed more clearly than ever the importance of having an effective regional structure. The crisis was precipitated when, as a result of a decision by the Wellcome Foundation, an expected major investment in the Daresbury laboratory in Cheshire—the synchrotron project—was removed from the north-west and made in Oxfordshire. That undermined the local scientific and research base that is so important to future growth and the retention of the existing skills base. That decision galvanised the region. The North West Development Agency took a leading role in bringing together business, scientists, local authorities, Members of Parliament, the trade union movement and a range of people interested in the future of the north-west. Apart from drawing attention to the very unsatisfactory fact that more than 70 per cent. of Government research and development expenditure goes to the south-east and the London area, the decision resulted in a number of changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those changes came about in part because the north-west brought itself together as a region, and in part because in my right hon. Friend the Member for Tyneside, North (Mr. Byers), we had a sympathetic Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. His action in response to the strong impetus and strong organisation from the north-west resulted in a major announcement, made earlier this year, of massive investment in the north-west's science base. That included the Casim project, the feasibility study for the fourth generation of light sources, a major investment in bio-pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities, and a proposal for a north-west science council. Since those announcements, the North West Development Agency has announced that it will go ahead with a science park at Daresbury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That action shows the importance of having an organised regional structure. If such a structure had existed formally before, I doubt that the Wellcome
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
Foundation would have found it so easy to take the decision that it did. That underlines the importance of bringing people together across the region. The projects that have been promised to the region mean benefits right across the region. In my constituency, Liverpool university is directly involved in the majority of projects based on Daresbury laboratory: in particular, the major Casim project will greatly benefit Liverpool and develop the skills base in that part of the north-west. The whole experience has demonstrated how it is necessary to act regionally in order to deal with the economic needs of the region's science and research base.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today, I draw attention to a new issue facing Liverpool in particular and Merseyside and the north-west in general: retaining the skills base at the Marconi company in Liverpool. Marconi is at the centre of new technology, which is the kind of investment that we want and need. It currently employs about 2,500 people in Liverpool. It is a centre for high-technology skills that deals with software engineering and the research and development of computer operations and information technology. A little while ago, the company announced that it will make between 200 and 400 redundancies at its Liverpool site. At the same time, Marconi has stated that it anticipates increasing employment by about 3,000 new jobs, but that that increase will take place in Ansty, Nottingham and Northampton, where the company will develop centres of excellence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The big question is why the existing Liverpool site cannot be developed as a centre of excellence. If we accept that other parts of the country outside the north-west should become centres of excellence for major world players such as Marconi, we are saying that the skills base in Liverpool and the north-west could be at risk. That is unacceptable. The North West Development Agency, which is currently working with trade unions and Members of Parliament, is putting together a plan to develop and promote that skills base, which is another example of the importance of regional action. I raise that example in Committee today because it is a live issue. It is about both maintaining the regional skills and research base and building on what we have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister can give some reassurance that the Government will support activities taking place within the region on the initiative of the region. It is people in the north-west, specifically in Liverpool and Merseyside, who are closest to the impact of what is happening and they have taken the initiative to put things right. I hope that both the Government's newly reactivated regional policy will bring practical results and the retention of the Marconi site in Liverpool as a future centre of excellence will be one practical result of our new regional policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
it is the most disadvantaged region in the United Kingdom. I hope to use the next few minutes to explain some of those disparities and propose ways to overcome some of the problems affecting our region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At 77.3, our GDP per head of population is the lowest in the United Kingdom. London's GDP of 146 is probably not a fair comparison as there are huge disparities within London, but the eastern region's GDP of 103 and Scotland's GDP of 96 demonstrate how far we as a region lag behind the rest of the country. Sadly, all other indicators are equally bleak. Although unemployment has decreased dramatically over the past four years, it is still nearly twice the national average. As a region, we have the lowest business survival rate and the lowest level of educational attainment in the United Kingdom. The indices of deprivation that were published in 2000 identify seven districts in the north-east as among the poorest 20 local authority areas in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many reasons for the problems that we face. The rapid decline in shipbuilding, heavy engineering and mining has played a major role. However, even within our region, there are huge disparities of wealth and of opportunity. There are leafy suburbs and smart new housing estates with properties selling for hundreds of thousands of pounds, cheek by jowl with local authority three-bedroom, double-glazed, centrally-heated semis that cannot be let or even sold for £2,500 each.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arts in the region are flourishing, adding to and improving civic pride and the quality of life. The publicly funded "angel of the north" and the conversion of the Baltic flour mill on the Tyne as a contemporary arts centre of international standing are two excellent examples, and there are many more. The beautiful new millennium footbridge over the Tyne sets new standards of design and engineering. Made in Tyneside, in many ways it completes the famous Tyne bridges scene. It has a huge advantage over the millennium footbridge in London: when it is completed in two or three weeks, people will actually be able to walk across it. However, against that backdrop of welcome and exciting projects bringing tens of millions of pounds into our region, we occasionally struggle to find funds to maintain our brass bands. Not all of our children have access to musical instruments, and we cannot fund the community projects that we so desperately need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of Government policies, there is probably more money being invested in the north-east now than ever before. We have health action zones, education action zones, action for jobs, single regeneration budget funding, objective 2 and objective 5B funding and many more targeted initiatives in the region. Generally, they are successful, but sometimes the funding ends before the problem is solved. There is a lot of money, energy and passion being targeted at our region, yet unemployment remains twice the national average. Many of our communities are not sharing in the prosperity of the rest of the nation. That cannot be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
Several issues must be tackled immediately to enable the area to realise its full potential. We need to strengthen our industrial and economic base, diversifying into new and improved technologies. One example of that vision would be to build a clean energy centre, and I offer my constituency as a base for that new centre. The UK's only offshore wind farm is there, but sadly it uses imported technologies. Newcastle university is a world leader in photovoltaics, yet we do not produce them at all in the United Kingdom. We have a history in the region of engineering excellence. Let us bring all of that together on one site, with research and development along with our universities. Let us design and manufacture state-of-the-art renewable energy systems, for which there is a huge international market as nations strive to come to terms with global warming. Our region fuelled the industrial revolution and I am confident that we are capable of powering cleanly this century and beyond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one example of how we could strengthen our industrial base, but we also desperately need to connect people in business to job opportunities. The region's transport infrastructure requires continuous development and, as the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed said, the Al needs to be made into a dual carriageway right up to the Scottish border. Major improvements are also needed on the east-west links—the A66 and A69. There is an opportunity to develop within the region a truly integrated public transport system by reintroducing passenger rail services on the Blyth and Tyne line, linking one of the most deprived parts of the region into the Tyneside conurbation and the Stephenson jobs corridor. Other opportunities exist in County Durham and Teesside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current standard spending assessment is not adequate for the region's needs. Our education funding is £232 per pupil less than London's—before any London adjustments. Population decline affects our local government income. I love my region, but there are times when I wish that Hadrian's wall was the border with Scotland and that we had access to the same levels of public funding that are available to the Scots. My hon. Friend and neighbour the Member for Blyth Valley (Mr. Campbell) speaks of little else: for relaxation, he occasionally has a pint in the Services club in Blyth, whose quiz team has won many a tie-breaker by correctly answering the question, "What is the mathematical calculation of the Barnett formula?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to identify and explain some of the region's problems and have suggested one or two solutions and improvements. I do not doubt that the Minister and her team work hard on the strengths and weaknesses of all the regions. The only long-term solution is to allow the people of the north-east to decide their priorities for themselves. In a recent poll, the north-east was the only area outside London to agree with the statement that a regional assembly would look after its interests better than central Government. That was before the public had had the opportunity to examine the performance of the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales, which, as hon. Members have noted, is well liked and respected.

A directly elected regional assembly with specific devolved powers and budgets would help to realise the final statement in a regional economic strategy document that was produced very recently. It stated:
	<br><q><p>"In 2010 the north east of England is a vibrant, self-reliant and outward-looking region with the assertion, ambition and confidence to unlock the potential of all its people."</p></q>
I urge the Minister to make a commitment to the setting up of an assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Wyatt	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Sittingbourne and Sheppey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My constituency is in the area of the South East of England Development Agency and I declare that my father-in-law, Allan Willett, is the chairman. That has led me into some correspondence with the Commissioner for Public Appointments. I would not wish any hon. Member to go through what my family went through because a family member was closely involved in economic development while another was a Member of Parliament for the same region. I hope for some reform of the procedures in the new Parliament. The relevant form should require those concerned to declare that there are Members of Parliament in their midst. None the less, I am a huge supporter of the regional development agency, even though, owing to my personal circumstances, I have been unable to make a greater contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We in the south-east have a different issue to contend with from those outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Murphy) and the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed, in that the region does not hang together: it is not a cultural, linguistic or religious entity, and it is mere accident that the South East of England RDA has been created. The region extends from Milton Keynes to Margate and to Portsmouth. There is nothing to bring us together or to lead us to feel warmth about the region. Those circumstances present us with distinctive problems in that we are, in a sense, behind the north-west, the north-east and parts of the midlands in our thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that it would be fair for regional government to be awarded to a region on account of its relative coherence. Many hon. Members feel that the Thames gateway, north and south of the Thames, which includes part of the areas covered by the East of England and the South East of England RDAs, is a far more coherent region. Will the Minister reflect on the possibility of changes to the map of the regional development agencies? Are they set in stone? That could have a huge impact on the way in which the Thames gateway feels, which is in part owing to the fact that the south-east RDA has ignored London. The majority of people who live within 40 minutes of London commute; they do not feel part of Kent, Hampshire or Surrey. They are a commuting class and feel that they belong to London, but they have no vote there. The problem is complicated, and I do not have a solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck mentioned that we have not engaged our universities. We have 120 universities, but I do not believe that they
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
represent 120 centres of excellence. In Canterbury, we have the University of Kent. We might compare it with Stamford, in silicon valley, but Stamford's board took it upon itself to own the poorest schools within a 50-mile radius saying, "We have a duty to ensure that those schools are higher performers." Who could imagine a single university in this country saying that it had a role in respect of the poorest sectors in Liverpool, Newcastle or Sheppey, where I live? Imagine what a breath of fresh air it would be if the universities were far more integrated into their regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a debate to be had about how we disinter the traditional role of the universities and we must be quite hard in dealing with the issue. We will have world-class universities and regional universities and they should work together. Great practice at the universities in Newcastle, Liverpool, Nottingham or even—God forbid—Oxford and Cambridge should be shared, not sealed in; it has to be brought out of the ivory tower. We have been saying that for 50 years, but we still need to debate the issue. The Thames gateway has no university. In Medway and Swale—the unitary authority and the district council respectively—there are 380,000 people without a university. That is the largest population in Europe without a university. That shows that in the 1960s Robbins saw university expansion very differently from the way in which we need to look at it now. We need to tie universities more closely to their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed tourism. Some RDAs have it and some do not. The south-west RDA has tourism in its area and it immediately gave financial help, but that is not necessarily true of the south-east RDA or other RDAs. Some have more urgent needs than others. I accept that there must be organic change and growth among RDAs, but tourism is our fourth largest industry, and it is clearly the responsibility of the wrong Department. It needs to be dealt with by the Department for Trade and Industry and it needs a much stronger ministerial presence if we are to promote it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same can be said for arts boards. I was privileged to go to Salford—an unusual destination. One would have to spend two and a half days there to see everything. There is the magnificent Lowry centre—people forget what wonderful things the Millennium Commission has done—and the imperial war museum, which is nearly finished. I know that it is in the Minister's constituency, because she asked me in the Lobby one day to make sure that it was finished in the end. The point is that the area has been regenerated. We have never considered the arts as a regeneration mechanism. The Arts Council is fundamentally wrong not to see the arts as promoters of economic growth, but they are. Hundreds of jobs have been created in Salford. Land that could not be sold for dozens of years has been sold and the premium has gone up. There is good will and confidence in the system. We should compare that with the situation in Sittingbourne and Sheppey, which are an hour from London: there, there is no drama, no theatre and only
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0235">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
one small cinema for 65,000 people. One would think that we had a greater and stronger cultural life, but we do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thing that the RDAs have missed is the need for a real audit of the basic requirements that regeneration can meet. My hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Quinn) is not here at the moment, but he talked about getting the base of the pyramid correct. We have some blocks, but the cement is a bit loose. Even in the Treasury, we appear to lack a fundamental economic understanding of the regenerational factors of tourism, the arts and sport. People usually go to Manchester for Manchester United, but now they must go to the Lowry centre and they will have to visit the imperial war museum. Those will become destinations, as they should be. However, we have lucked into that, rather than got there through the regional audits that are necessary to create regeneration through sport, art and the universities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are still 200 economic committees responsible for economic growth in Kent. I was hoping that the RDAs would bang some heads together and stop public money being wasted. To be fair, they have only been up and running for two years, but there is more economic activity in the committees than outside them. In the end, the Barnett formula or Hughes formula may change that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The devolution argument worries me most. I cannot remember any Welsh, Scottish or Northern Irish Members asking for regional assemblies before they got their National Assemblies and Parliament. We are asking for regional assemblies with no English parliament or assembly, and I am beginning to wonder why. I am nervous that we are going a road that we have not considered in enough detail. We have debates about the House of Lords—we had one this week— but we were not allowed to consider the unitary chamber in the Wakeham report. We were not allowed to discuss why we never see MEPs or why they are not located in the British constitution. That is not the case in Finland, which has a unitary Chamber. I know that its population is only 3 million people, but its MEPs must report back to the MPs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With devolution, the development of constitutional reform has been a muddle. As we establish regional assemblies, we must place them in a larger constitutional debate. My instincts tell me that we shall come to have four national parliaments in the United Kingdom and that the upper house will be the house of representatives of those four. If we do not have that, Scotland will inevitably be lost to the UK, which in 20 years' time we would come to regret. I accept what a famous existential philosopher, Soren Kierkegaard, said:
	<br><q><p>"the truth is … in the minority".</p></q>
I recognise the depth of his wisdom in respect of my wish for four Parliaments and a house of representatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Cousins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the points made by the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed and my hon. Friends the Members for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman) and for Wansbeck, but this may not be the right occasion on which to rehearse the facts of our situations. At the end of a Parliament, perhaps it is more sensible to consider the politics of the issue under discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most telling points was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck, who reported that the Barnett formula was cropping up as a topic at quiz nights in working men's clubs in Northumberland. That is a reminder that issues that were the inconvenient obsessions of a handful of people for many years are now gathering momentum as issues that cannot be disregarded. Following the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey, I accept that that does not apply to all parts of the country, but in some parts those issues are now the stuff of real practical politics, not simply the subject matter of articles in learned journals. They are not simply the kind of thing that people talk about at seminars and social occasions. We are discussing something that in regions such as the north east is now a significant issue of practical politics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the next Parliament, the people whom we represent will have views and opinions on the issue which they will insist that we express. They feel, rightly or wrongly, that their needs go unrecognised in the mechanical distributions of resources between the regions and nations of this country, and they will want those needs to be met. They will insist on a greater share and a greater recognition of their needs, which I hope that the Minister and her colleagues will take into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are no longer talking about something relatively obscure. I had a discussion about the Barnett formula with a senior member of the Cabinet who said, "Why are you talking about this? It is like the Schleswig-Holstein question; anyone who understood that either went mad or died, apart from Lord Palmerston, obviously. No one understands it." If I share with members of the Committee the information that I was talking to a rather Palmerstonian figure they will understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about something on which people have views and opinions. People have unmet and unrecognised needs, and unrealised opportunities. People see a hidden potential that cannot be unlocked on the present basis and they will insist that that is recognised in the next Parliament and that practical measures on devolution or resources are undertaken to meet those needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey comes from a different part of the country where the matters we have been discussing, and the way in which they are discussed, have a different shape and form. He must accept that in some parts of the country views are forming and hardening. There is a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0236">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
political momentum for change, which must be recognised, but not every part of England will move at the same pace. I hope that my hon. Friend will see that it is sensible to allow that to happen; it should not worry or alarm him and those whom he represents or cause him to want a rigid formula to be imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to many more discussions with my hon. Friend, but there may be considerable difficulty because some of us come from parts of the country where people feel that the issue cannot be ignored for much longer. Needs must be met and people will expect us to deliver that in the next Parliament. I hope that my hon. Friends who represent other parts of England will accept that my argument is not intended to threaten anyone, to beat anyone over the head or to be a means of gaining an advantage. I hope that hon. Members will recognise that we are expressing the strongly held and genuine views of many of the people whom we represent. We cannot afford to ignore them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Great Grimsby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate is really about regional imbalances and, therefore, about money. As my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) said, these are now matters of public debate. People know and feel resentful about the different levels of spending in different communities. That is one reason why regional feeling is growing; it was bound to happen. As soon as we started developing regional institutions and structures, the information about spending levels seeped out. It is now well known, thanks to the work of the Campaign for Regional Government in Yorkshire, that public spending per head is £1,047 less in Yorkshire than it is in Scotland. When we learn that we would need £5 billion to bring public spending in Yorkshire up to the same level as in Scotland, it produces a real sense of grievance. My hon. Friend the Minister said that spending for the RDAs has increased and will increase. We are all grateful for that—it is important—but spending on regional development is still £330 million more in Scotland than in Yorkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to keep crying that from the rooftops, because funding is a question of power. As the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed said, because devolution has occurred and Scotland, Wales and London have devolved structures, they also have platforms to put their cases more powerfully and come to deals with the Government. He pointed out that the platform that the Mayor of London has from which to talk on equal terms—very cleverly, I must add—with the Government about the public-private partnership plan for the tube was achieved by the kind of devolution that we are discussing today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need a platform such as that in Yorkshire and Humberside, and devolution for Scotland and Wales makes it more necessary. First, we are competing for a diminishing amount of footloose industry; the competition is now intense. Secondly, we are competing for public spending. Thirdly, the way in which the devolved structures are developing allows them to apply finance to their own purposes. My hon.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby mentioned the fishing industry. Scotland has allocated £27 million to support its fishing industry and, if it chooses, can spend nearly all of that on decommissioning. Compare that with the pathetic £6 million allocated by the Government to the English industry, which is 30 to 40 per cent. of the entire British fishing industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quinn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The irony is that some of the skippers from Whitby, whose boats are registered in Scotland, will benefit more from Scottish devolution than from the lack of devolution for Yorkshire and Humberside. That is how the formula will apply for compensation to the fishing industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention. In the Select Committee on Agriculture yesterday, the point was made to the Minister responsible for fisheries that a steady flow of English vessels that are registered in Scottish ports will go north to collect the dosh and, perhaps, to decommission. The point was not answered, but that looming problem will be difficult to resolve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for regional government and devolution is strong. It will be a major issue in the next Parliament in a way that it was not in this one, because devolution for Scotland and Wales held centre stage. I make only three caveats, which we must bear in mind. The first is that devolution and or regional government must be strong and effective. My slogan in such matters is "What Scotland gets, we need." It is no use offering people in the regions a watered down package of, shall we say, petty devolution, because it will not be worth voting for. People will vote for and on something that has the potential to improve their lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that the much weaker—in many respects, pathetic—devolution structures conceded to Wales were carried by a majority of only 7,000, whereas, in Scotland, there was turnout, interest, and a big majority. Scotland got an effective system of devolution; Wales did not. That must be borne in mind when we come to the devolution to the English regions. My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central mentioned his hopes for a referendum. We do not have to put all our eggs in the referendum basket. It would be comparatively easy for the north-east to win a referendum for devolution and regional government. To achieve that might be more difficult in other areas that are slightly behind the north-east in that regard, such as Yorkshire and Humberside, particularly if the Tories choose to oppose devolution for those regions. They always oppose such proposals initially, and subsequently accept them and praise them as marvellous ideas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not tie ourselves to the concept of a referendum. There are other means of expressing and developing consent. My hon. Friend the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey made a telling point about an English Parliament and regional representation. Each region need not have the same version of devolution. A variable geometry structure could be introduced. That is the system that Spain has adopted. Its regions take two decisions: first, whether they want
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0237">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
a regional government, and, secondly, what form it should take and what powers it should have. We should move swiftly towards that system by introducing a measure early in the next Parliament. That would allow us to get on with the job of setting up regional structures, and of creating accountable and democratic systems for all the regional institutions that we have established, such as the learning and skills councils, the RDAs, and the regional offices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome today's development, although it has been somewhat belated. The right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed said that 24 years have passed since he sat on the previous Committee. A quarter of a century has passed. Today, we are standing in the foothills and looking up at the mountain of regional government, which lies ahead of us. We will climb it, and, from the summit, we shall see a view of the regions. We might not enjoy a view of the promised land immediately in the next Parliament, but it will, eventually, become visible. The process that has begun today must continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ronnie Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blyth Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be as brief as possible. The Barnett formula was devised 22 years ago to help to revitalise Scotland, which had gone through a bad period of shipyard closures and so on. The formula provided money for public expenditure. That, at least, was the official reason for it; the unofficial reason related to the Scottish National party making great inroads into the Labour vote in Scotland. The formula was a buy-off of the Scottish people. That second aspect of the Barnett formula still exists today. I understand the issue involved, but I cannot understand why the Government—the Chancellor and Prime Minister—have closed their minds in the past four years to the idea of bringing us up to the Barnett formula or devising a Barnett formula part 2, which has been referred to many times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our debate this afternoon has been good. Different regions have different problems. It is fine if the block money meets the needs of those regions, but the Barnett formula is much discussed and people in my constituency ask me why Scotland receives free tuition fees and personal help for old people when people in the north-east of England—or anywhere in England— cannot get it. Scotland receives an extra £1 billion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall finish off with the story of LG, because it is a great one. That company was supposed to come to my constituency. We were delighted and we thought that we would get some money together—£4,500 a job. We thought that we would have a big factory in our region, but that did not happen; the factory went to Wales, because it had extra funding and the Barnett formula, which meant some £24,000 a job. We could not compete with that, and that is wrong. I understand
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
that that is being changed, but I do not understand why we are being done down again in comparison with Scotland and Wales. Will the Minister explain what is happening with the money for the regions for the industrial side?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>3.52 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an excellent debate. We have shown that there are regional imbalances and inequalities, but we have also discussed the reasons for the different economic positions in the English regions, the factors that need to be addressed to improve that economy, the priorities that must be addressed first and the differences in the action that needs to be taken. Hon. Members have presented different histories and constellations of problems requiring different solutions in our regions. This historic debate—as some members of the Committee have called it—has itself, by the contribution of those members, demonstrated the most powerful case for the regional perspective and for the Government to provide the vehicle for that perspective to be articulated and implemented in government and regional policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of hon. Members made points, so I hope that I can do them justice in the time that I have. I have picked out four themes in addition to some of the detail mentioned by hon. Members. First, for many hon. Members, the related issue on the question of imbalances and inequalities regionally is funding. Several hon. Members have referred to the Barnett formula and the local government formula. The right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed initiated that theme, and it was continued by my hon. Friends the Members for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central, for Great Grimsby, and for Blyth Valley. I stated the Government's position on the matter, and I am sure that my hon. Friends' words will be noted. As my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby says, the subject will continue to be strongly addressed in the next Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make a general point in addition to those that I made in response to questions. I understand the point about the strength of feeling about perceived considerable differences in funding levels or funding per head, particularly vis-à-vis Scotland and the English regions. However, in relation to Barnett, but particularly local government finance—with which I am more familiar—I tell my hon. Friends that we do not want to reach a position from which we argue for exactly the same amount per head for services for each of our different areas of the United Kingdom. Although, as the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed said, we want to work towards achieving the same standard of public services, we must recognise that to achieve the same standard and the same opportunities for people in different parts of the country, we must acknowledge that costs differ throughout the country, and that levels of need, which impact on cost, differ. We must reflect on the fact that the same amount will not achieve the same standard of public service in different areas, so, inevitably, if we are to meet need and strive for the same standard of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0238">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
service, different areas will receive different amounts; otherwise, we are not, as my hon. Friend the Member for Blyth Valley reflected, redistributing to meet need. I am sure that my hon. Friends accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A second theme was to acknowledge the importance of RDAs and other regional partners in reacting to local challenges. I am pleased that my hon. Friends the Members for Scarborough and Whitby and for Riverside acknowledged the contribution of such partners, and particularly the RDAs, to the Plaxton and Daresbury matters. In relation to Marconi, local partners have been galvanised to respond to that matter. I am sure that Government Departments will support that regional initiative, as they already have with matters such as Daresbury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A third theme was the importance of a wide range of factors to reduce economic disparity and inequality. My hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby mentioned transport, and my hon. Friend the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey referred to the importance of higher education and the role that that should play, and increasingly plays, in several regions—certainly my own in the north-west. Universities there, as my hon. Friend the Member for Riverside will testify, were crucial in mobilising the response to some of the matters that she mentioned. We certainly need to see more of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further theme concerned many hon. Members looking forward to and supporting the process of the evolution of the regional agenda, and wishing to see a movement toward directly elected regional government. There was a variety of views on how that could be put into operation—whether there is a one-size-fits-all formula or whether we can contemplate the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
possibility of people in different regions moving at different speeds or even toward different structures to accommodate peoples' regional aspirations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One matter that we all share is our indictment of the Conservative party, which has shown no interest in the English regions, and no concern about the imbalances and inequalities that we have discussed. Its disastrous economic policies of 18 years only served to widen and deepen such imbalances and inequalities. Although we are discussing regional policy, we are really talking about people. Clearly, Conservatives have no regard for people in our regions, who need the thrust of regional policy to deal with the specific regional challenges faced. If the Conservatives were serious about their concern, they would have been here to support us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our policy is founded on the belief that, if we are to make progress, that progress must be at the regional level. Central Government have the task and responsibility of putting the macro-economic structure, templates and tools in place, but it is at regional level, with the full involvement of local partners, that enterprise, skills, innovation, higher education, scientific excellence and infrastructure can be dealt with most effectively to deal with the imbalances and inequalities that we want to see reduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
