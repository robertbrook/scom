	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. Gary Streeter)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee recommends that the Damages Bill 	<i>[Lords]</i> ought to be read a Second time.</p></blockquote>
I am delighted to be called by you, Mr. Winterton, and to serve under your chairmanship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It gives me great pleasure to bring before the Committee another Bill to give effect to the recommendations of the Law Commission which has met with general support on both sides in another place. The Bill gives effect to recommendations made in its report "Structured Settlements and Interim and Provisional Damages", presented as a result of its examination of the present remedy of damages. The aim of that examination is to ensure, in particular, that people who are bringing claims because they have been injured should get proper compensation for their injuries with special regard to personal injury litigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is the result of the first report in the series, which concentrates mainly on the use of structured settlements. The structured settlement is quite a recent development which enables claims, especially claims for very serious injuries, to be settled in a way which ensures that the injured person will be properly cared for for the rest of his or her life. The broad framework is that instead of getting a large lump sum all at once, the victim takes a tailor-made package, designed to meet his or her individual needs. That is typically a smaller lump sum first, to look after past losses and immediate needs, followed by guaranteed, index-linked payments for his or her lifetime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the bill has one clause less than the draft Bill annexed to the Law Commission report, it includes one extra reform which follows a general recommendation made by the Law Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Commission thought that a general solution should be found to meet a particular problem which had arisen in the context of structured settlements offered in the public sector. Although it is a normal feature of private sector structured settlements that an annuity is purchased to provide the injured person with periodical payments during his lifetime, Government Departments and public sector bodies are more likely to provide such payments out of their own resources so that the settlement is self-funded. There was some reluctance to accept self-funded structured settlements offered by public sector bodies which could, in theory, cease to exist without their liabilities being taken over unless such settlements were backed by some form of government guarantee. The general solution is in clause 6, which confers a statutory power for ministers to enter into such guarantees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an extra provision in the Bill. Hon. Members looking at the Law Commission's draft Bill might think
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
that some of the other provisions have been left out. Indeed, some of them are not in this Bill, for the excellent reason that they are already on the statute book. Those of the Law Commission's recommendations that related to the tax treatment of payments made under structured settlements—which are complementary to provisions included in this Bill—were implemented in the Finance Acts of 1995 and 1996.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An opportunity was also found in the previous Session to include one of the Law Commission recommendations in the Civil Evidence Act 1995. The purpose of that Act was effectively to abolish a technical rule that hearsay evidence was not usually admissible in civil proceedings. The Ogden tables, which are actuarial tables published by the Government Actuary's Department for use in the assessment of damages, are a special kind of hearsay evidence, affected by that rule, and the 1995 Act was therefore an appropriate place to take forward the proposal to make it easier and cheaper to use the Ogden tables in court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That explains the additions and omissions. Fuller explanations of the current law and the proposed changes may be found in the Law Commission report to which I have referred. Full notes on clauses are available for any hon. Member wanting to examine the provisions in greater detail—I see that many of my colleagues are already tucking into those—so I propose today to explain the provisions of the Bill in fairly broad terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 is there to help the courts in their assessment of lump sum damages. It is concerned with the discounts that must be applied when the plaintiff receives an immediate lump sum payment to compensate for future loss, such as the loss of income he or she might have expected to earn over perhaps many years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jean Corston 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that the measure of damages awarded will refer to common law measures, and that they will involve, for example, the Smith v. Manchester decision, which related to handicap in the labour market? If so, does he share my concern that a similar measure of damages is no longer available to the victims of crime through the criminal injuries scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Streeter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady makes a political point in her parting comment, which is not appropriate in our debate. With regard to her first point, there is nothing in the Bill that impinges in any way on the measure of damages that a court might be asked to assess. The Bill relates to the discount rates that might be applied to a lump sum settlement rather than to the measure of the settlement itself, which will be assessed in the same way as it has been assessed in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The discount reflects the fact that a person receives all the money immediately and can invest it straight away, although if he had not been injured he would not have received most of it until later on in his life. The clause gives the Lord Chancellor—and, where appropriate, the Secretary of State for Scotland—the power to prescribe the rate of return that courts should take into account. The provision in the clause is not exactly the same as in the Law Commission's draft Bill.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0742">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
It makes no reference to any specific indicator to be the initial prescribed rate, and it is more flexible. That will allow the Lord Chancellor to take into account the conclusions about to be reached in the appellate courts, which are already considering the same issues, before proceeding to any exercise of his power. Hon. Members may know that the Court of Appeal has already heard three appeals on those very points. We shall consider its conclusions carefully when judgment is given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 resolves around the residual doubt about whether courts can, at the parties' request, make consent orders for damages to be paid other than by an immediate lump sum payment. It is, of course, an essential feature of structured settlements that at least some of the damages will not be paid immediately. The clause therefore resolves any doubts about whether a court has the power to order a structured settlement by consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3 deals with the interaction between the provisional damages regime, the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 and the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934, where the Law Commission had found the present position uncertain and unsatisfactory. That reminds me of the Labour party. Provisional damages are those that are awarded when there is a recognised risk that the injured plaintiff's condition may get worse in a particular way, but he chooses to accept an award assessed at the time on the basis that it will not, although he will have the right to apply for further damages later if it does. Clause 3 prevents an award of provisional damages made to a person who died as a result of the same injuries, from barring an action after his death by his dependants under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976. However, it also prevents the same losses being taken into account more than once in assessing the overall damages payable by the defendant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clauses 4 and 5—and, as I have already described, clause 6—are designed to allay possible concerns, in private and public sector structured settlements respectively, that beneficiaries accepting such settlements might not have adequate protection in the event of the failure of the body responsible for making payments under the settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Law Commission for its careful work in producing the report on which the Bill is based. As I have said, that is part of the first fruit of the Law Commission's examination of the law of damages, and we look forward to considering its further reports in that project when the time comes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.38</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Boateng 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brent, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a relatively uncontentious—and certainly highly technical—measure, which is none the less welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to his hon. Friends tucking into the notes on clauses. Looking around me, however, I am bound to say that some of them seem to be indulging in rather more exotic fare. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Well, some Conservative Members have suddenly taken to a simpler repast, and at least one Conservative Member is making a great show of doing so although he may not have been partaking of that particular feast earlier. To remain in order, members of the Committee are required to discuss the contents of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernard Jenkin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Colchester, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman assure me that he has studied the report of the Select Committee on Social Security on compensation recovery and its relationship to the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention, which was timely. However, I am not sure how apposite it was or how much bearing it has on the matters before us. Nevertheless, I shall take care to ensure that that impinges on my consciousness before Report stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I presume that that was a piece of unusual—or perhaps not unusual—self-advertisement on the part of the hon. Member for Colchester, North (Mr. Jenkin), who, I fancy, must have been on that Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah yes, I see that he was, in which case, I shall take his remark in the spirit in which it was offered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is relatively uncontentious and technical but it is highly important to those people who seek justice in our civil courts in personal injury cases. It is obviously vital to the quality of a successful plaintiffs life that he or she is ensured appropriate and accurately assessed damages. It is an area that has long given cause for concern to personal injury lawyers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This concludes consideration in this House of a process that began many years ago and which was started by the noble Lord Hailsham, who established an inter-departmental, inter-professional working party, involving both actuaries and lawyers, whose unanimous recommendations formed the heart of the Law Commission's original Bill. It gave the matter considerable care and attention and, at this stage in our proceedings, it is right that we should thank that interprofessional working party, chaired by the distinguished Queen's Counsel, Sir Michael Ogden, for its work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings us to an area that we should explore a little at this stage, and which I hope we shall explore in more depth when the Bill receives its Second Reading and we proceed to Committee and Report stages. As the Minister outlined, clause 1 deals with the multiplier by which the assessment of damages for future pecuniary loss is arrived at. The general principle of assessment is that the amount of loss anticipated over a year is multiplied by the number of years for which the loss is expected to continue, subject to a discount to reflect the fact that the lump sum will be paid immediately and will be available for investment to provide income, whereas the loss it represents would have been spread over a period of years. It is the calculation of investment and its product that is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause empowers the Lord Chancellor, after consultation, to determine the return to be expected from the investment of a sum awarded as damage for future pecuniary loss. He then proceeds by way of an order. I want to explore that order and the need to proceed in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Commission's proposal, which originated from the inter-professional working party of actuaries and lawyers, was that we should proceed differently, referring not to a rate of return based on a basket of gilts and equities, but to index-linked Government stocks—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0743">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
ILGS. That was an important proposal because the introduction of ILGS provided a more certain basis on which the parties to litigation could proceed and a more secure form of investment. Certainty and security are central to appropriate and just calculation. The interprofessional working group and the Law Commission found that attractive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The working party concluded that the rate of return should be based on the ILGS, suggesting, with the Law Commission's agreement, that the appropriate rate is that for stock bearing the description of inflation rate 5 per cent, over five years. That would currently give a return of 3.8 per cent. The Law Commission's draft Bill provided for rules of court to specify the index-linked Government security to be used. It also provided for the use of an alternative indicator if the Lord Chancellor decided that no ILGS existed to which reference could be made. It is possible—though highly unlikely—that at some later date the Government might decide to cease issuing such index-linked stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to a parliamentary question in March 1995, the Lord Chancellor made clear that he intended to implement all the Law Commission's recommendations. That would have included specific reference in the Bill to the index-linked Government stock criterion rather than proceeding through the general power given to the Lord Chancellor by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, acceptance of all the recommendations was also anticipated in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This Bill gives effect to the principal recommendation of the Law Commission".</p></blockquote>
The Law Commission's principal recommendation on the assumed rate of return on investment of damages—the subject of clause 1—was that specific reference should be made not to a general power for the Lord Chancellor but to ILGS. That would ensure certainty, which is necessary for all parties, and security, which is obviously always the preference of plaintiffs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happened? Why did the Lord Chancellor change his mind? The uncharitable suggest that he was got at by the insurance industry, which has an obvious interest in keeping the level of damages awards as low as possible. Insurers would like to find a way of relieving defendants who have lost litigation of the burden of paying damages calculated by reference to an indicator that would lead to a higher lump sum. Something happened. I see the Minister responding visually in the negative to the suggestion that the Lord Chancellor and his Department were got at by the insurance industry. If that was not so, perhaps he will explain what happened. It is not good enough for him simply to refer to three cases, albeit not by name. Wells 	<i>v.</i> Wells, Thomas 	<i>v.</i> Brighton Health Authority, and Page 	<i>v.</i> Sheerness Steel are the cases concerned. They were considered by the Court of Appeal and are likely to go to the House of Lords, but that is no reason to depart from the Law Commission's recommendations and the careful scrutiny and study of the topic by the inter-professional working party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lord Chancellor does not require the wide power in place of the proposal that reference should be made
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
to ILGS. By all means give the Lord Chancellor the power to adopt another criterion, after consultation, if the ILGS becomes inappropriate, but the Opposition are highly sceptical about the decision to ditch one of the central recommendations of the Law Commission report which is widely favoured among practitioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chairman of the inter-professional working party made his views clearly known to the noble and learned Lord Ackner and the noble and learned Lord Simon of Glaisdale, both of whom take the view that the Law Commission's initial proposals were preferable. The incoming chairman of the actuarial professional body also believes that the Law Commission's proposals are preferable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lawyers and actuaries, who are most intimately concerned with the proposals, together arrived at a specific view, but the Lord Chancellor's Department took a different view. When a matter has been referred to lawyers and actuaries and then to the Law Commission for a considered view, and when the Lord Chancellor is purported to have accepted all the recommendation, a very good reason is necessary to persuade the Opposition that it is right not to proceed as originally intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that specific caveat, which we intend to pursue, we welcome the Bill, which will bring greater justice to defendant and plaintiff. It has been a long time coming and it is the fruit of careful consideration. We should give it a warm welcome and a speedy passage through the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.54 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Streeter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) for his support for the Bill and for the best wishes and congratulations that he conveyed to those who have been so hard at work in bringing the Bill to this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised the important issue of index-linked Government securities. He was right to say that they formed part of the Law Commission's recommendations and were thought of as an indicator of what discount rates should be. However, the hon. Gentleman was wrong to say that that proposal was a central plank of the Law Commission's recommendations and that it is the only one of the commission's recommendations that we have not adopted. We have made many modifications, and I alluded to some of them in my opening remarks. Certain recommendations have not found their way into the Bill, and we have done other things slightly differently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In expressing his scepticism as to the reasons why our proposals for the discount rates are slightly different from those in the Law Commission's report, the hon. Gentleman is making much ado about nothing. The Lord Chancellor has not been got at by the insurance industry, nor is he capable of being got at. He does not bend in the prevailing wind as Members of the Opposition Front Bench appear to do week after week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I almost turned instinctively to you, Mr. Winterton, for protection. The Minister's remarks are incredible. I am not suggesting that he feels the need to make a reputation in his newly acquired position, but he is going some way towards obtaining a reputation for causing quite unnecessary political acrimony and for injecting bias into the most unlikely vehicle. I assure the Minister that he will have plenty of opportunity in the weeks and months ahead to engage in politics. He need not inject them into this innocuous vehicle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am able to assure the hon. Member for Brent, South that, whenever he justifiably needs my protection, he will get it. I am not responsible for the utterances of Ministers, or Opposition spokesmen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Streeter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Brent, South for the profound compliment he has just paid me.

We have introduced more flexibility in the Bill than the Law Commission recommended because, over the
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
past few years, case law has become the key determinant of discount rates. Case law has evolved and developed. Therefore, it is wise that the Lord Chancellor should take the time to see what happens to important cases in the Court of Appeal, and possibly the House of Lords, before finalising a decision on the discount rates that will prevail under the Bill. He may exercise his power to introduce the Law Commission's recommendation, but he may go for more flexibility than that. That is a wise approach, which the hon. Member for Brent, South would appreciate in a more lucid interval.

We shall return to these issues in Committee. However, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and to my hon. Friends for their support for the Bill. I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
