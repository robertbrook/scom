	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Bill [	<i>Lords</i>]</h1></div>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. Gary Streeter)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee recommends that the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Bill [	<i>Lords</i>] ought to be read a Second time.</p></blockquote>
I am pleased to bring before the Committee a Bill to give effect to recommendations deriving from two reports of the Law Commission, which met with support on all sides in another place. Notwithstanding that general support, the Bill has also received the closest scrutiny in the other place and has been amended and improved in a number of particulars. That is as it should be, because although the area of law with which the Bill is concerned may seem arcane, it affects a large number of people, particularly home owners. Given the technical nature of the Bill and the detailed scrutiny that it has already received, I shall explain its provisions in fairly broad terms. Full notes on clauses are available, however, should any hon. Member wish to study the Bill in detail. I am sure that several of my hon. Friends will want to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part I of the Bill does away with the complex dual system of strict settlements and trusts for sale established in the property legislation of 1925 and replaces it with a new simplified single system known as the trust of land, covering both concurrent and successive interests. Good news for law students, you will agree Mr. Hill. All trusts involving land will become trusts of land on commencement of the system, with the exception of certain specialised statutory schemes and existing strict settlements for the benefit of individuals, where change would cause unnecessary upheaval and possibly unfairness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the trust of land, trustees will hold the land with power both to sell and to retain it, rather than being under a duty to sell as with the present trust for sale. As a consequence, the doctrine of conversion—by which interests in land subject to a trust for sale are deemed to be interests in money rather than in land—is abolished, reflecting modern conditions of property ownership, where joint home owners, in particular, would be surprised to learn that their interest is deemed not to be an interest in land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part I also makes detailed provision for the administration of the new trust, balancing more flexible powers of management for trustees against extra rights for the beneficiaries, such as a right to be consulted about the administration of the trust unless the settlor considers that inappropriate and expressly excludes it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part II of the Bill makes provision affecting trusts of all types of property, not only those involving land. Where the beneficiaries are all of full age and capacity
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
and together absolutely entitled to the trust property, so that they could under existing law end the trust and require the property to be conveyed to them, part II offers them the option of directing any of the existing trustees to retire, directing the appointment of a new trustee or trustees of their choosing, or combining both directions. There is provision for a settlor to exclude those provisions from applying to the trust if he considers them inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part III of the Bill deals with supplementary matters such as definitions of terms used in the Bill, commencement and territorial extent, which is limited to England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I am grateful to the Law Commission for the meticulous work that went into producing the reports on which the Bill is based and for its continuing assistance during the Bill's passage, and to parliamentary counsel for rendering a very detailed and technical set of reforms in such a succinct and accessible form. I also wish to put on record the Government's appreciation of the assistance provided by members of the Law Society's land law and succession committee, who worked closely with departmental officials in scrutinising the Bill and suggesting ways in which it might be adjusted and refined. As a result of that collaborative approach, in which the noble Lord Mishcon, played a prominent part, the Bill has benefited from close and constructive consideration at every stage in the other place, and has been significantly improved in its detailed operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.34 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Boateng 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brent, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In dealing with the concepts of trusts for sale and strict settlements of land, the Bill speaks to us of a very different age from this one—an age when it was inconceivable that land should be dealt with other than as a source of profit, through rent, or as a home to someone and his successors through blood and title.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Things have changed. Given that I see a few knights of the shire assembled on the Conservative Benches, there may be people in this Room—perhaps including you, Mr. Hill—who regret the passing of that age of tranquillity. However, most ordinary owner-occupiers, who have found themselves unintentionally in a position in which a strict settlement was created that interfered with their proper disposal of their own property, will breathe a great sigh of relief at the good sense of both Houses in addressing the issue. That has been done in accordance with the recommendations of the Law Commission, ably assisted—the Minister has given credit where it is due—by the Law Society's land law and succession committee and a number of noble Lords in the other place, not least Lord Mishcon and the Lord Advocate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are required simply to put our seal of approval, such as it is, on the work that they have done. It is important and valuable work—not the sort that grabs headlines or causes controversy or discussion on the "Today" programme or the "Nine O'Clock News". Nevertheless, a number of people have made this subject almost their life's work and have spent a considerable amount of time on it. We should thank them for that, and give the Bill a fair wind, wishing it good speed into the final stages of its parliamentary life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.37 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Alison 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Selby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng), prior to taking a necessary swig from a bottle, alluded to elderly knights of the shire who might or might not be members of the Committee. The hon. Gentleman made a very eloquent speech, representative of the best of new Labour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to say how much we welcome the first appearance at the Dispatch Box—if one can put it like that—of the junior Minister who is breaking his
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
duck by taking this important Bill through its stages. He made a formidably competent and penetrating speech. We congratulate him on his promotion and assumption of office and wish him every good fortune in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
