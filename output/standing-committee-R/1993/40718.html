<p>[SIR JAMES KILFEDDER <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>

<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Law of Property (Miscellaneous<br><br> Provisions) Bill [Lords]</h1></div>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. John M. Taylor)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee recommends that the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill [<i>Lords</i>] ought to be read a Second time.</p></blockquote>
There are a number of causes for satisfaction this afternoon, not least for me; this is the first time that I have had the pleasure of appearing under your chairmanship, Sir James. The hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng) invited me to tell the Committee that he apologises for not being here this afternoon; he has a family occasion and, of course, he has our good wishes for that. The hon. Gentleman is handsomely deputised for by the hon. Member for Kingswood (Mr. Berry) who, I understand, will regale the Committee at length later this afternoon.<br><br>
The more serious and perhaps more permanent cause for satisfaction is that in taking this step this afternoon, the two Houses of Parliament have managed to implement in full the Jellicoe procedure in another place and the House of Commons Second Reading Committee procedure, thereby operating the fast-track alternative legislative procedure that Members of this House have wanted for Bills that have no known enemies. In that spirit, I must tell the Committee that the hon. Member for Brent, South told me at the end of last week that the Bill has his full support. The process is a means of keeping the Chambers of the two Houses clear for contentious business and of transacting uncontentious business elsewhere.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
<p>So it is, Mr. Kilfedder, that this Bill is the first to proceed in another place under the Jellicoe procedure, involving consideration by a standing committee with the benefit of evidence from interested parties. As a result, it has undergone very considerable detailed scrutiny and some refinement and improvement. I am sorry, Sir James; I think that I may have used a lower case prefix for your name, for which I apologise.</p>
<p>Full notes on clauses are available for any hon. Members who wish to study the Bill in detail. I shall be brief and shall content myself by drawing my remarks to a conclusion.</p>
<p>The Bill represents a useful and uncontroversial measure of law reform which has attracted the support of the legal profession, and which has been thoroughly scrutinised in another place and, as a result, improved in its detailed operation. Accordingly I ask the Committee to recommend that the Bill be given a Second Reading.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Berry <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kingswood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: When my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South asked me temporarily to adopt Front Bench responsibilities this afternoon, I thought that it would give me a unique opportunity to attack the Government for one thing or another. When I discovered what my task was, I was obviously bitterly disappointed. Indeed, my comments will be even briefer than the Minister's.<br><br>
The Bill is uncontroversial and has the wholehearted support of the Opposition.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee recommends that the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill [<i>Lords</i>] ought to be read a Second time.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Committee rose at twenty-six minutes to Five o'clock.</i></p>
