<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Police and Firemen's Pensions Bill</h1></div>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee recommends that the Police and Firemen's Pensions Bill ought to be read a Second time.—[<i>Mr. Maclean.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I briefly raise one matter of concern in relation to the Bill? I must first say that the Minister has been extremely helpful in previously outlining the purpose of the Bill. That has made clear the Government's intention, which is to help individuals who opted out of the police pension scheme and were sold unsatisfactory insurance or other schemes.<br><br>
I think that we all agree that those people were unwise to make that decision. Indeed, I understand that they did so against the advice of the Police Federation. Nevertheless, they made that choice, and were to some extent encouraged to do so by the Government. I accept the purpose of the Bill as explained by the Minister: to assist the full reinstatement of the pension rights of police officers and firefighters.<br><br>
The information that the Minister has circulated to the Committee makes clear—as does the Bill—that costs are intended to be recovered by the local authorities and police authorities, so no burden should fall on them. However, the explanatory and financial memorandum says that the Bill will have no financial implications for either the police authorities or the local authorities because
<br><blockquote><p>"Any additional costs incurred by police and lire authorities in providing information to personal pension providers and in reinstating pension rights where there was mis-selling will be recoverable from those who mis-sold the private pensions."</p></blockquote>
Concerns and representations have been made over a considerable period about the delay in publishing a review of such schemes. There has been debate about the delay to reviews and a report by Deloitte and Touche, which raises some of those concerns, was commented on by Opposition Members in November and December last year.<br><br>
My concern is to ensure that the recovery process does not lead to the possibility of any costs falling back on police authorities and local authorities. Is there any danger that delay to reviews or delay to recovery could lead to a financial penalty, or is the process of recovery a matter for the individuals concerned, with the oversight of the reinstatement being the responsibility of the relevant police authorities and local authorities? I should be grateful for the Minister's assistance with that point.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
<p>4.35 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like briefly to follow up the points made by my hon. Friend and Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael). I support the straightforward objective of the Bill, but could the Minister tell us today—or if he cannot, in future—how many people have opted out of each scheme? Does he know how many people want to come back into a scheme because of mis-selling? Mis-selling of pensions is a major social issue and it is incumbent on the Minister to tell us the scale of the problem and the timetable for action.<br><br>
Although the Bill is welcome, it is based on unsteady foundations because, as the Committee will know, police and firemen's pensions are pay-as-you-go schemes. Can the Minister tell us the implications of the Bill on local authorities, because that concerns me greatly? I am concerned about the budgets of fire authorities and police authorities because a growing proportion of their total budget is spent on funding pensions. In Nottinghamshire, my local authority, 13 per cent.—£3 million—of the total fire budget is now devoted to pensions and that figure is growing; 12 per cent.—£1 million—of the police budget is spent on pensions and the figure is also growing. That is a lot of extra bobbies that could be put on the beat. I seek an assurance from the Minister that the Bill will not put an extra burden on fire authorities or police authorities. It is a big problem—a ticking time-bomb—to which no one has the solution. Someone, however, must get to grips with it.</span></p>
<p>4.38 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. David Maclean)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to respond to the points raised by hon. Members. I agree that the question of police and firemen's pensions is a ticking time-bomb; I can assure all hon. Members that the Bill does not shorten the fuse in any way. There must be about 170,000 police and fire officers in the country; we think that the total number affected by the legislation—those who exercised their judgment, opted out of the scheme and were possibly mis-sold a pension scheme—is about 500 at most. It is impossible to say how many will come back into a scheme, but knowing the scale and the generosity of police and fire officers' pension schemes, it would be extraordinary if those who had been sold a pup did not do so when they know that they have the chance.<br><br>
No financial burden will be placed on the authorities; the result of the review and of the decisions that have been made in connection with the general mis-selling of financial services is that the mis-sellers have to finance the costs and a reasonable share of administrative costs. Other public sector pensions can be tidied up by statutory instrument, but legislation is required for police and firemen's pensions; because of that we do not anticipate a delay. If the mis-sellers cause a delay—which I do not think will happen—they will have to make up the difference and re-fund the scheme; they

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
will have more money to put back into the scheme once the police officers and fire officers are able to join. With those assurances, I hope that the Committee is satisfied with the Bill.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
