<div class='page-header'><h1>Representation of The People Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mr John Maples)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee that the Representation of the People Bill ought to be read a second time.</p></blockquote>
The Representation of the People Bill is a short, technical Bill designed to correct an inadequacy in the current law as set out in section 29 of the Representation of the People Act 1983.<br><br>
Section 29 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 provides for the reimbursement to returning officers of the expenses incurred in running parliamentary elections. Those expenses include the personal fees of the returning officers, presiding officers and poll clerks, the cost of printing and issuing ballot papers and polling cards, the travelling and subsistence expenses of all officials, the renting of rooms for use as polling stations and for counting ballots papers, and many other items. Hon. Members will be aware of all the tasks involved.<br><br>
Section 29 of the 1983 Act provides that the Treasury shall, by statutory instrument prescribe a scale of maximum charges in respect of services rendered and expenses incurred by returning officers in organising parliamentary elections. In other words, the Treasury shall set out in regulations the maximum amount that returning officers may be reimbursed for each service.<br><br>
Section 29 of the 1983 Act further provides that the reimbursement of such expenses shall be from the Consolidated Fund and not from voted money. Parliament intended when passing that provision that returning officers should be assured that they would be reimbursed for their reasonable expenses. The best way of providing that reassurance was to pay the money direct from the Consolidated Fund.<br><br>
The provisions of section 29 of the 1983 Act go back to the Representation of the People Acts of 1918 and 1919. The 1983 Act is simply a consolidation of previous legislation. Under the European Assembly Election Regulations 1986, section 29 of the 1983 Act also applies to European elections.<br><br>
The implementation of section 29 has not been straightforward. The problem is that the amounts spent by returning officers on the conduct of elections vary considerably, with the result that no maximum charges for those amounts would be reasonable for every constituency.<br><br>
That difficulty applies in particular to travelling and subsistence costs, to the cost of printing and providing ballot papers and poll cards, of renting rooms and of other miscellaneous items. If the maximum charges are set too high to allow for high costs in certain areas, returning officers in other areas might spend or claim up to that maximum. However, if the maximum is set too low, great difficulty can be caused when returning officers reasonably
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
and properly incur expenditure that exceeds the relevant amounts. In short, what is fair and reasonable in one constituency may not be so in another.<br><br>
The solution has been to provide in the regulations that, for certain items of expenditure, returning officers will be entitled to receive their "actual and necessary costs". However, in 1987, Mr Speaker's Counsel advised that that was ultra vires. He pointed out that section 29 of the 1983 Act provided that the Treasury should prescribe a scale of maximum charges, so maximum charges should be prescribed and that "actual and necessary costs" would not do.<br><br>
The Government accept that that advice is right, and that the way that the regulations had been drawn up for many years had strictly speaking, been inconsistent with the wording of the 1983 Act. Therefore a way had to be found of complying with the 1983 Act that still allowed returning officers in every constituency to be reimbursed for their reasonable expenses.<br><br>
The device that was used to surmount that difficulty in the regulations for the 1989 European parliamentary elections was to provide that, for those items where it was not reasonably possible to specify scale maxima applicable to every constituency, returning officers would be entitled to their reasonable expenses up to an "authorised maximum". That in turn was defined as the expenses incurred in each constituency at the 1987 general election but uprated by 31 per cent. and subject to an overall addition of £25,000.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Great Grimsby)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is fascinating to learn that the Government allowed for 31 per cent. inflation between 1987 and 1989. I had not realised that they had mananged to get it that high. Will the Minister give us examples, as I am alarmed at the scale of variation between the cost of running an election in the north of Scotland, where it is presumably done for a few bawbees, and in a metropolitan centre such as Grimsby. What are the variations in returning officers' costs for accommodation and hiring rooms for different constituencies?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I found substantial discrepancies. During the 1987 general election, the returning officer for Slough claimed more than £4,000 for travel, whereas the returning officer for Alyn and Deeside claimed £1.27; he must have taken the ballot papers on the bus. For printing poll cards, Stroud claimed more than £3,800 and Fylde £101—I assume that there was some left over from the previous election. On renting polling stations and count venues, Hornsey and Wood Green spent £6,700, whereas, Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale spent £537. Although those are substantial discrepancies—and I have more of them—all the amounts were approved by the National Audit Office. The expenses were properly incurred and audited and there were good reasons for the discrepancies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will send me other examples. Perhaps, he will also send me an application form for the post of returning officer in Slough.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I was misheard. The first example was Slough and the second was Stroud. It would be difficult to be returning officer in both constituencies at the same election.<br><br>
At the recent parliamentary by-election, a similar practice was followed of uprating the 1987 expenditure. That is clearly a complicated and unsatisfactory approach,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0547">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
and only tolerable on the understanding that the underlying inadequacy in section 29 of the 1983 Act will be corrected at the first opportunity.<br><br>
Moreover, the authorised maximum approach will break down at the next general election. That approach can work only as long as the 187 general election constituencies remain unchanged. However, the Milton Keynes constituency is to be divided into two at the next general election. Then it will no longer be possible to apply the authorised maximum device to the two new constituencies.<br><br>
The Milton Keynes problem could be overcome at the next general election, but the regulations would have to be drafted in an artificial and unsatisfactory way. The authorised maximum approach would fail altogether on the next general revision of parliamentary boundaries, which are to be reviewed shortly.<br><br>
Section 29 of the 1983 Act causes one other difficulty. The expenses of returning officers may, in practice, exceed the statutory maximum laid down, but do so for good reasons for the purposes of running a parliamentary election. In such circumstances, extra-statutory payments to the returning officers concerned have been made by the Treasury. The payments have been made out of voted money rather than from the Consolidated Fund. They have also tended to be fairly small. Nevertheless, there is doubt whether it is right to pay them because section 29 of the 1983 Act expressly states that returning officers should not be paid in excess of the scale maxima set out in the regulations. In the circumstances, it seems highly desirable to amend the law to ensure that there is no need for such extra-statutory payments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Viggers <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gosport)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend has shown himself so resilient in depth under cross-examination by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), can he tell me anything about the remuneration of returning officers? Does it vary much across the United Kingdom and, if so, by how much? I ask because the remuneration of returning officers is added to their other income in determining their pensions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend allow me to deal with that later? I shall have to study the regulations before I can give him an answer.<br><br>
The Bill solves the problems in the 1983 Act by amending it and essentially does two things. First, it provides that, when it is not reasonably possible to specify a maximum charge for an item of expenditure applicable in all constituencies, returning officers shall be entitled to their actual expenses, provided that they are reasonably incurred. Secondly, it provides that, for those items for which it is possible to specify a maximum charge, the Treasury may authorise payments in excess of the specified maxima, again provided that the expenses have been reasonably incurred.<br><br>
In other words, the orders to be laid down by the Treasury will continue to specify the maximum amounts to be reimbursed for certain items of expenditure. Where, however, it is not reasonably possible to lay down the scale maxima applicable to all constituencies, it will be possible to reimburse returning officers their actual and necessary expenditure, provided that it has been reasonably incurred. Moreover, if for good reason a returning officer has to spend more than the scale maxima to ensure that a ballot is properly conducted, the Treasury will be able to reimburse him for the full amount spent.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
These changes are essential if returning officers are to be reimbursed their reasonable expenses when organising parliamentary elections. They are nevertheless technical in that they do no more than enable section 29 of the 1983 Act to work in the way envisaged by Parliament when passing these provisions earlier this century: that returning officers should be reimbursed their reasonable election expenses, and that those payments should be made from the Consolidated Fund and not from voted money. I, therefore, believe that the changes are uncontentious. I hope very much that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will welcome the Bill and recommend a Second Reading accordingly.</span></p>
<p>10.40 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. John Marek <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Economic Secretary because, although he has been a Minister for some time, this is the first time that he has been in charge of a Bill. The Bill is important and I hope that in Committee we can have a good interchange of views and make it a better Bill as a result of our deliberations.<br><br>
I am in favour of the reform of Parliamentary business, as we often sit around until beyond midnight. It is a good idea for this debate on Second Reading to take place in Committee. We are detaining not all 650 Members of Parliament but a smaller group with a closer interest in the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: An elite Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Quite. It is a Committee with a greater interest in the subject, and it will be able to go into matters in more detail. I hope that the Bill will have its Committee stage upstairs rather than on the Floor of the House because there are not many issues in the Bill on which we could muster much cross-party anger and antagonism.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to caution my hon. Friend. He must not rush in and give such assurances as the Bill might refer to the Common Market and therefore arouse controversy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may arouse controversy because later I intend to refer to the European Parliamentary Elections (Returning Officers' Expenses) Regulations 1989. The sums referred to in that statutory instrument seem quite large.<br><br>
The media do not appear interested today. They are interested only when there is a row and not when Parliament is getting on with the business of examining legislation.<br><br>
I want to make a number of substantive points, but I do not necessarily want answers from the Economic Secretary now. The principle of the Bill has been explained by the Economic Secretary, and I agree that legislation is required. I do not like extra statutory concessions of whatever form. They are necessary, but where they can be dispensed with, they should be. If that means primary legislation, I am glad that we have this Bill. If it can regularlise matters, that is all to the better. However, if it does so it is important that Parliament knows what sums are spent. The Bill will allow, in certain circumstances, the making of extra payments of an undefined nature for undefined reasons. I hope that we can refer to that again later so that we know what money Parliament is asking the Government to spend.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0548">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
I am a little worried about returning officers receiving fees for these services because generally they receive reasonable salaries from their local authorities. Do local authorities deduct pay from returning officers and acting returning officers for the time that they take off from their other duties as employees of local government, or do those officers delegate some of their tasks to other employees of the local authority? But in that event, local authorities would then have to foot the Bill, even though the fees were received by the returning officers and acting returning officers. I know that presiding officers and polling clerks have a set scale of fees, but there is a lot of administration involved in running an election and I wish to know who actually pays for that because it is not made clear in the statutory instruments.<br><br>
The point made by the hon. Member for Gosport (Mr. Viggers), is answered by the Returning Officers' Expenses Regulations 1990 which in part A, paragraph 1(1):
<br><blockquote><p>"For conducting the election and generally performing duties which a returning officer is required to perform under any enactments relating to parliamentary elections, other than any duties for which separate fees are prescribed herein … £862·60."</p></blockquote>
That is the net fee, by way of salary, and it is superannuable. On top of that, extra amounts are payable if a constituency has more than 50,000 electors. that adds up to a tidy sum. However, it is nothing compared to the fees for European parliamentary elections. The European Parliamentary (Returning Officer's Expenses) Regulations 1989, which are in the same format as the statutory instrument that I mentioned earlier state that the returning officer's fee is £6,760. I take it that those fees go into the pockets of the returning officers after the job has been done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why so big?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend asks why the fee is so big. Perhaps the Economic Secretary will put me right if I have misread the statutory instrument. On top of that fee, there are additional sums. Part B of the statutory instrument, which runs to three pages, covers disbursements and schedule 2 deals with the fees payable where there are two elections on the same day. Are all those fees a correct use of Treasury money? Should such comparatively large sums be given to officers who already receive adequate salaries as employees of their local authorities? It is possible that much of the work for elections is done by employees of the lcoal authority which has to foot the bill and does not get a Treasury subvention for that work. Perhaps we can consider that when the Bill is in Committee.<br><br>
The list of disbursements in the statutory instruments that I have mentioned is possibly too detailed and abstruse. For example, the European Parliamentary Elections (Returning Officers' Expenses) Regulations 1989 provide, in part B, paragraph 3(1)(d):
<br><blockquote><p>"For the completion and issue of the cards on the occasion of an election:"</p></blockquote>
For every 100 cards or fraction thereof issued (or withdrawn in respect of voters entitled to vote by post) the sum of £31·65. Can that be simplified? Perhaps there should be a gross maximum so that returning officers can have more freedom and can take account of the different circumstances in their constituencies. Clearly, fees for presiding officers and polling clerks need to be set, but do we need to go into so much detail?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
Why is it not good enough to use the phrase "actual and necessary costs" in the statutory instruments? Why do we have to put in "authorised maximum"? The Opposition will be tabling amendments in Committee so that we may discuss that matter in more detail.<br><br>
It is amazing that the travel claim for the constituency of Slough was £4,000 whereas that for Alyn and Deeside was £1.27. Both constituencies are roughly the same size, suffer from the same traffic problems and have a similar urban nature, yet there is a huge discrepancy. Why is that? Did all officials go by private car or taxi in Slough? Did all officials take the bus in Alyn and Deeside? Perhaps the Treasury should give more advice to constituencies on those points. I do not quibble with the fact that the National Audit Office found that the expenses were properly incurred, but that is not the point. Perhaps Alyn and Deeside would have required more money if it had carried out its task more effectively, or less, in other circumstances. The National Audit Office does not necessarily consider that aspect.<br><br>
If we need to spend more time on this argument we can do so in Committee when we debate amendments. Several of my hon. Friends wish to raise other matters in Committee. I hope that the Minister will consider our amendments carefully. The Opposition have no objection to the Bill being given a Second Reading. We insist however, that it is considered properly in Committee after the Christmas recess.</span></p>
<p>10.51 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Viggers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Bill. It is quite right that the Government should bring it forward and I am confident that it will become law.<br><br>
The way in which returning officers are remunerated during elections is a hangover from the days when town clerks, who were solicitors, could charge personal fees for taking on articled clerks. It became a perk of the job. Nowadays, the tradition means that a town clerk or chief executive is remunerated as the returning officer in election year, which is of considerable benefit to the individuals affected.<br><br>
If there were several elections in one year, remuneration would be considerably greater than if there were no election. The remuneration is superannuable, as the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) said. But it is more important, if there are several elections in the year in which a town clerk retires, that the extra remuneration is added to his normal remuneration and the total figure taken into account in calculating his pension.<br><br>
Town clerks do a wonderful job and deserve decent pensions, but it is wrong that their pensions are determined in such a random way, according to whether there are several elections in their retirement year or none at all, in which case there is no windfall profit. I hope that my hon. Friend will deal with that, either in this debate or during consideraion of the Bill in Committee.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise if I do not stay for the response to my speech.

It is unfortunate that a representation of the people Bill, however minor compared to former ones, should be dealt with in a Second Reading Committee. Such Bills, concerned with basic provisions of democracy, should be dealt with on the Floor of the House, even if a small Committee has technical advantages.<br><br>
The electoral arrangements in Britain are in crisis. The electoral register is about 600,000 names short, according to the estimated populations of England, of Scotland and of Wales. In Scotland, names began to disappear about three years ago, and the trend has been followed in England and Wales. There is no problem with the electoral register in Northern Ireland where the numbers in relation to the estimated population hold up, as they have in the past. The major reason for the fall in numbers is the poll tax, which is having a bad effect on electoral registration even though people are obliged to register. We should bear that in mind when we seek to improve the lot of electoral registration officers.<br><br>
We spend little in Britain on publicising the need for electoral registration, and therefore in assisting the work of electoral registration officers. In the last financial year, only 0.31 per cent. of Government expenditure went towards encouraging electoral registration—about £320,000. That is insignificant compared to the £7·5 million spent by Abbey National on a campaign to encourage people to vote in the ballot to decide whether it should be turned into a public limited company. Furthermore, only half the amount spent on encouraging British nationals overseas to register was spent on encouraging people in this country to vote. I understand that the position has improved recently and that there has been poster and newspaper advertising to encourage people to vote in the south-west of Britain. We should encourage expenditure to create an atmosphere in which as many people register as possible.<br><br>
We should not skimp on the operation of the electoral franchise and should ensure that plenty is spent on democracy. It is only when we try to fiddle and manoeuvre democracy that we spend small amounts of money. We should not have spent money on attempts to increase overseas registration. That seemed to be a manipulation of the electoral system. There was compulsory registration for people resident in this country and voluntary registration for people overseas.<br><br>
The Minister seemed to say that amounts for reimbursement come from Consolidated Fund moneys and do not invade the provisions for local government, which is sorely oppressed in the amount that it can make available for electoral registration. Local government officers must double up and take the place of returning officers and assistant returning officers. We should be aware of the wider problems of electoral registration when we consider the minor details of its function and operation. Unless we get the overall picture correct, only a limited amount can be done in tidying up the bits and pieces.</span></p>
<p>10.59 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes), I welcome the fact that the Second Reading is taking place in Committee. It is an uncontentious measure and this is an expeditious and helpful way to proceed, which does not waste the time of the whole House. This is a weighty subject. I had not realised how weighty until I asked a policeman, "Where is the representation of the people?" and he replied, "I don't
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
think you'll find that here." I was not sure where the Committee was being held and I wondered about the nature of the institution in which we are supposed to be serving.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) said, we should devote some time to considering this matter. We all make speeches at elections thanking the returning officer for his efforts—most recently my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Rooney), who is with us today. It is right that we should devote attention to their remuneration and as my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East said, it should not be skimped. Spending should be liberal and generous because it is important that elections are properly and efficiently conducted and that there should be full and effective registration.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Gosport (Mr. Viggers) appeared to suggest that, since there is a possibility of more frequent elections as a result of hung parliaments in the 1990s, we should give a discount on remuneration for quantity in any one year. If that was indeed the essence of his argument, I could not go along with it.<br><br>
Since it is important that we do not skimp on elections, I wonder about the interpretation of the phrase, "reasonably incurred" in relation to expenses. The Treasury's interpretation of what is reasonable is most unreasonable. I can think of no worse institution to interpret the term "reasonable" than the Treasury. Having recited the past practices and legal anomalies, can the Minister say how the measure will be interpreted and what will be accepted as reasonable?<br><br>
It is possible that extra expenditure will be incurred in the ridiculous extension of the franchise to people overseas. There will be potential anomalies and frank and we shall have to consider policing the validity of registrations.<br><br>
I have just received an application for registration from my son in New Zealand. So few people came forward that the Government extended the time for registration. His application must be authenticated on the form by another British passport holder resident in the country from which the application is made. That is incredibly difficult for a returning officer in Grimsby or Alyn and Deeside—or wherever the cheapjack operation was—to police. What kind of expenses does the Minister envisage being necessary to police registration?<br><br>
When the principle of local registration and local representation is removed, we will be in unknown territory in which the potential for anomaly, to the extent of outright fraud, is enormous. The responsibility for checking falls on the returning officer. Not only have the applications to be authenticated, but there is the matter of where those applications are to be lodged. It has been argued that it would be possible for party organisations to gather applications and focus them on marginal seats. The Minister may nod, but he must explain how that can be stopped and what is returning officers' responsibility. If people have been overseas for 10 years, their last place of residence is a hypothetical consideration when it comes to submitting an application for registration.<br><br>
We must consider how the registration will be policed and what expenses will fall on returning officers as a consequence of the new, untested arrangement, which will be particularly difficult to enforce.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0550">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an interesting point. May I suggest that, when the Minister replies, he delineates the precise point where the electoral registration officer's powers end and the returning officer's begin.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will be a difficult area for both. Extra responsibility will attend on the whole procedure, and we need to know about it in authorising this legislation. As my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East reflected, new efforts are needed to encourage registration because of the impact of the poll tax. A universal pattern is emerging of declining registers except, as was pointed out, in Northern Ireland. It is interesting to note that only in Northern Ireland—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Dickens <span class='memberconstituency'>(Littleborough and Saddleworth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: They vote early and often.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I vividly remember reading in David Butler's 1950 election book of a practice, that was introduced in Northern Ireland, of authenticating officers from the parties attending at the polling booth. The book cited one polling booth in Northern Ireland where the authenticating officer arrived after the poll had been open half an hour. Two streets of people, whom he knew to be his own party supporters, had rushed in in that half hour and voted before he was there to authenticate the votes. He made a special effort to authenticate every vote that came in after that and succeeded in having several votes rejected. At the end of the day, the anger of the crowd on the opposing side was such that he had to be removed from the polling booth by an armoured car provided by the British Army. Clearly special measures apply in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
Apart from Northern Ireland, registration is down and special measures are needed to encourage people to register. That means more than inadequate advertisements. Why is there not a system of confidential registration? People are annoyed by receiving circulars through the post from firms who buy the electoral register. If people do not register because they are afraid of paying poll tax, registration will have to become a confidential matter so that people can get on the register without their names being published. A correspondent in <i>The Times</i> suggested that there should have been confidential candidates in the recent elections for the Tory party leadership.<br><br>
We want to know what measures will be taken to encourage registration and to build up the register. The decline in registration is more likely to hit the Labour party than the Conservatives.</span></p>
<p>11.9 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Gosport (Mr. Viggers) raised a matter in an intervention which was subsequently raised by the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek). The fees for returning officers are laid out in the regulations that are passed under this legislation and in those that will be laid out under the new Act. At the moment, as the hon. Member for Wrexham said, they are £862.60 for a returning officer plus additions if there are more than 50,000 or 60,000 voters. If a returning officer is responsible for more than one constituency he receives an additional fee.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned superannuation. I do not have information readily to hand, but I deal with it later. The hon. Member for Wrexham mentioned several
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
other matters. I thank him for his welcome. I hope that each Bill in which I am involved will be as uncontroversial and as short as this.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman said that under amended law—the Bill—there was the possibility of making extra, undefined payments for undefined reasons. It is true that there will be undefined payments, but it is not true that they will be made for undefined reasons. They will have to be made in respect of items which have maximum payments attached to them in regulations: they will have to be under headings approved in regulations. Payments in excess of that would not, by their nature, be made, they would be extra payments and not included within the terms of the regulations. They would, of course, have to be reasonable. The Treasury is the judge at present, but those payments would have to be approved by the National Audit Office: at present, no payments can be made from the Consolidated Fund without the NAO's approval.<br><br>
Returning officers delegate some of their duties to assistant or acting returning officers. When they do this, they also delegate—or pass on—some of their fees. I cannot say precisely how that is done.<br><br>
I cannot say why the fee for European elections is so large. It must have something to do with returning officers running about 10 constituencies in a Euro-election—a Euro-constituency is equal to about 10 Parliamentary constituencies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Viggers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Eight.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says eight. My Euro-constuency has 10 constituencies. Presumably they have to pay on much of that fee to assistant returning officers. I shall deal with this in more detail during the Committee stage.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Wrexham asked whether the list of payments was too detailed and whether we should have a gross maximum. We are looking at the scope for simplifying regulations and will have discussions with local authorities. Simplification is not exactly an easy answer because, the greater the simplification, the more discretion there must be in making payments. Perhaps that is not a particularly good way to go. If there were a gross maximum, there would be a tendency to spend to the maximum, which is inappropriate in many constituencies.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked why the old phrase "actual and necessary" was not sufficient. The Act said that regulations should specify maximum payments. Everyone knew that there was a problem, and we got round it by saying that everyone could pay up to what was actual and necessary. We were advised by Mr. Speaker's Counsel and, having looked further into the matter, he thinks that the advice is correct, that the words "actual and necessary" do not properly flow from the authority to prescribe maximum payments and that one has to prescribe in regulations either a sum of money or a formula which can lead directly and inexorably to a sum of money. It is a legalistic rather than a legal problem: nevertheless, it is the sort with which all of us in this place are familiar.<br><br>
I was asked why travel in some areas was so expensive. Travel expenses in the south-east and in urban constituencies tend to be greater, especially where polling clerks are often women—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They can use the M25.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0551">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are no tolls on the M25. Polling clerks—often women—are not willing to work until 1, 2 or 3 am unless taxis home are available. I understand that much of the transport heading is represented by expenditure on taxis for that purpose. I was interested to hear the hon. Member for Wrexham suggest—especially in the light of the comments of his hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)—that the Treasury might be paying too generously. I shall return to that.<br><br>
I dealt with the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport (Mr. Viggers). I did not deal with the pensions question, but I promise to do so subsequently.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes) is absent so I do not feel inclined to respond to his speech. But he asked about the accuracy of the register deteriorating since the mid-1960s. We do not get an accurate check on it unless there is an accurate census. There was a census in 1981, and there will be one next year, which will provide a more accurate check. However, we check every year to find out how many of the population are entitled to vote. In 1976, it was 91·1 per cent. It then rose to 97·7 per cent. in 1984, since when the figure has deteriorated to 96 per cent. Between 1989 and 1990, the number of people on the register rose, whereas the year before it fell. I do not think that there is any correlation—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is clearly a tendency for the register to decline in accuracy because people are becoming more mobile and society is changing. That validates our case for greater effort to be made to upgrade the register. But that does not account for the decline that has occurred in the last year or so, which must be related to the poll tax. That change is on top of the long-term deterioration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, if the hon. Gentleman looked at the figures, which are tentative because of the lack of a census, he will see that this is a long-term trend. The percentage deterioration between 1989 and 1990 is 0·3 per cent., which is less than in any of the previous three or four years. Therefore, there is no supportive evidence for the hon. Gentleman's allegation. If it is true, I am sure that we should all make it clear to people that they do not reduce their chances of having to pay the community charge by failing to put their names on the electoral register. In fact, the chances are that they will not be able to avoid the community charge by any such strategem. When they find that is true, I suggest that they should all get back on to the electoral register, if they ever got off in the first place. There seems to be no solid evidence that they did.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to be repetitious. The Minister's formula is ambiguous. We want a positive indication that the electoral register will not be used for the compilation of the poll tax. That is what is putting people off. Surely the electoral roll is used for that purpose. If people appearing on that register are specifying their existence, it increases their chances of having to pay poll tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dickens</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give way to my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dickens</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are so many different ways of identifying people in terms of health registers, dental registers, tax office returns, and so on. They can all be used to trace people and, therefore, it does not follow that people are relying—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the simplest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dickens</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It probably is the simplest, but I do not think that anyone is relying purely on the electoral register to identify people who are justly liable, to pay the poll tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes my answer for me. Both registers are public documents, and it is perfectly proper for them to be used to check each other. However, I suggest that the community charge register is more accurate than the electoral register, which will eventually result in the electoral register becoming more accurate. There is an extraordinary morality in suggesting that it is proper for citizens to avoid their tax liabilities by taking themselves off the electoral register. I suppose that people could avoid their income tax liabilities by disguising the fact that they exist, and one of the ways to do that is to take themselves off the electoral register. I cannot believe that the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) thinks that that is the proper way for a citizen to behave. The fact is that the community charge is law—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is up to them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is suggesting that the community charge is responsible for taking people's votes away. That is the gist of his argument. He could make the same argument about income tax. We could all reduce our chances of getting caught by the Inland Revenue by taking our identification out of existence. First, this a fallacious point and, secondly, morally it is on the wrong track.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That point is not accurate. The Minister is wrong. Paying or not paying income tax is irrelevant to getting on the electoral register to vote. That is a basic fundamental human right. The fear is bound to exist among people who are unable to pay the poll tax that putting themselves on the electoral register will make them liable to pay poll tax. That fear is realistic because the electoral register is checked.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They do not become liable to the community charge by putting themselves on the electoral register. They are liable to pay it because they exist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Come on!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) will not continue to shout across the Committee Room.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are liable to pay the community charge because they are British citizens. They are not liable to the community charge because they are on the electoral register. The hon. Gentleman is onto a fallacious point. On a practical level, if people have that fear—and if they do, it is largely because they have been misled into it by the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends—the hon. Gentleman should advise them to get onto the electoral register as soon as possible. My experience is that the electoral register is inaccurate in the opposite direction—there are hundreds, if not thousands, of people on the electoral register in my constituency who have not lived there for some time or who have died. It is often inaccurate not by failing to have people on it but by having people on it who should not be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case, the electoral registration officer is not doing his or her job properly, and needs more staff or money to make the register more accurate.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0552">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to the functions of the electoral registration officer later. Northern Ireland was a bad example because if there is a notoriously inaccurate register, it is there. There is a well-trodden joke about a Northern Irish politician standing on a soap box outside a cemetery making a speech to five people. When asked why he was doing so, he said, "They will all be voting tomorow." The fact that Northern Ireland's register has been growing is an example that we should not pursue.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Great Grimsby gave an interpretation of "reasonably incurred" and suggested that we are never generous. Obviously he did not listen to the remarks of the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek), who suggested that we might be paying too much money. If it is any comfort, we are using the long-followed interpretation of those matters. There has been no suggestion from a returning officer that we have not paid proper expenses. If that happens in future, no doubt they will make their complaint widely and publicly known.<br><br>
Policing registration and extending the franchise to overseas voters are matters for the electoral registration officer. Such regulations do not involve payments to the returning officer. The functions of an electoral registration officer are matters for the local authority, and his expenses are covered by that authority. Considerable efforts have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
been made this year by the Home Office to encourage people to vote, and to warn them of the consequences of not voting, in a large advertising campaign that I have seen all over London and which may have been in other places.<br><br>
Overseas voters cannot be concentrated in marginal seats. As a holder of a marginal seat, trawling round the south of Spain to sign up voters is an attractive proposition, but they have to demonstrate that they were on the register that they seek to vote on now within the last 20 years. One cannot simply choose where one wants to register and do so; one has to show that one was on that register before.<br><br>
I have dealt with all the points that have been raised and I hope that the Committee can come to a conclusion. </span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
