	<div class='page-header'><h1>Agriculture and Forestry (Financial Provisions) Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. David Curry)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee recommends that the Agriculture and Forestry (Financial Provisions) Bill ought to be read a Second time.</p></q>
The Bill is a short but useful measure. Its main purpose is to deregulate the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation and its Scottish equivalent, the Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation, so that those organisations can offer a wider range of services to agriculture. It is mainly a public Bill, but one provision in clause 1 amends the organisations' memoranda and articles of association—that makes it a hybrid Bill. That amendment is a minor consequence of the main deregulation provisions and is supported by the corporations and their shareholders. The Government have complied with the relevant Standing Orders for private business and we shall move a draft motion to commit the Bill to a Select Committee, to hear any petitions against clause 1 and the schedule. The Bill contains three other financial provisions which I shall outline as I tackle the relevant clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 constitutes the guts of the Bill. The AMC and the SASC were set up in the inter-war years with Government support to provide long-term credit to farmers when few other sources of capital were available. Both organisations are now successful and they wish to expand their original role and concept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The AMC and the SASC have always been registered limited companies with shareholders, but they accepted some statutory restrictions on their activities in return for Government support. The principal restrictions are that the AMC can lend only on a first mortgage on agricultural land in England and Wales, and the same applies to the SASC in respect of land in Scotland. They can lend only up to two thirds of the total value of the security. They can lend only for the purchase or improvement of agricultural land. The memorandum and articles of association can be changed only with the consent of the appropriate Minister or Ministers. There are certain controls on the appointment of directors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of those restrictions were imposed 50 years ago—conditions have changed dramatically since then. Farmers now need to borrow for other reasons, for example, to finance diversification. Land is not necessarily their main source of security. More other sources of finance exist, and 1992 may add to the choices available. The organisations wish to be able to compete in that wider and more competitive market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
The AMC's Government loan of £10.6 milllion is a very small proportion of its total lending. The SASC receives no financial support. Neither organisation needs Government support or the attendant controls. We reviewed the future of the AMC last summer, and the response to our review favoured deregulation. The SASC is already largely deregulated. It is included in the Bill to ensure that both organisations are on an equal footing and that no anomalies remain between the constitutions and activities of the AMC and the SASC. The Bill will put them on the same footing as any other financial company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 repeals the legislation that enables Ministers to make financial advances to the AMC and the SASC and sets out conditions that they must fulfil to qualify for financial support. Those repeals will not affect existing mortgages and debentures. They will be brought into force by order, probably soon after the normal two-month period that follows Royal Assent. The AMC repeals will not be made until outstanding Government loans have been repaid. I anticipate that that will happen as the Bill becomes law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 also contains some minor consequential provisions, including the amendment to the organisations' memoranda, which makes the Bill hybrid. Both memoranda require ministerial consent to any changes. The main repeals will end that requirement, but scope for amending the memoranda themselves is limited by company law. Our legal advice informs us that the organisations could not change the relevant clauses even after the statutory requirement was removed. The Bill will, therefore, achieve that. The Government have discussed that with the corporations and their shareholders. They fully support the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the central question of how deregulation will affect the AMC's future activities. We have discussed that carefully with the corporation's shareholders, and what I am about to say reflects their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The AMC intends to remain firmly in the business of providing long-term loans to agriculture. That forms the basis of its current successful operations and is where its expertise lies. But deregulation will allow the AMC to be more flexible—for example, to lend on security other than land, to help farmers finance diversification projects and to offer loans outside England and Wales. The AMC will also be able to consider joint ventures with organisations providing other financial services if that offers the farmer a better overall package. While deregulation will help the AMC to adapt to the needs and challenges of the coming decade, I am satisfied that, in the main, the AMC will continue to do what it has always done best—provide medium and long-term loans to agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now deal with the AMC's shareholders—the Bank of England and five of the major clearing banks—because they will have an important role in helping to make the transition to deregulation as smooth as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bank of England and the AMC's other shareholders do not in any way guarantee the AMC's borrowings; but their involvement has been a major factor
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0508">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
in building up the confidence on which the AMC has successfully developed its business over the past 60 years. The shareholders are determined to ensure that the move to deregulation goes smoothly and efficiently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bank of England is anxious to ensure that the changes sought by the commercial bank shareholders and the AMC are made in an orderly manner, and readily recognises that it has a special, positive role to play in ensuring an orderly adjustment to the new market situation. The bank will only dispose of its shareholding when it is satisfied that that adjustment is assured. It is not for me to commit the Bank of England, but I expect that that will take several years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position of the clearing banks is a little different. Over the years they have increasingly entered the markets in which the AMC operates and they and the AMC now compete to provide a similar service to agriculture. It makes increasingly less sense for the clearing banks to continue to hold an investment in a competing company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, the clearing banks are genuinely anxious to ensure that the move to deregulation goes smoothly and efficiently. Apart from any wish to protect their own investment, the AMC's customers are their customers, too. So, while there is likely to be some disinvestment, the clearing bank shareholders have assured me that it will happen in an orderly way. Precisely how and when will be a matter for discussion between the AMC and the clearing banks, but I am certain that the AMC will be able to attract new capital. It is a successful organisation, and I believe that it can, and should, stand on its own reputation like any other successful private company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position of the SASC is a little different. The SASC is owned by three Scottish clearing banks which are fully involved in the formulation of its current and future plans. Unlike the AMC, the SASC lends only at a fixed rate of interest and is not in direct competition with its shareholders, whose lending is predominantly at variable rates of interest. For the future, the SASC's primary objective will be to provide a first-class service to the Scottish farming community through its competitive mortgage facilities. I understand that there are no plans for any of its shareholders to sell their holdings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the guts of the Bill. There are three smaller elements that I shall outline more briefly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 will enable the Government to recover the cost of supervising European Community grading schemes. Pig carcase grading was introduced on 1 January 1989. No charges have yet been made, but they will be made from 1 January 1992.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Pig Carcase (Grading) Regulations 1988 allow grading to be carried out by slaughters or the Meat and Livestock Commission. Such grading is supervised by our fatstock inspectorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mandatory beef carcase grading scheme will be introduced in January 1992, but detailed implementation is still being considered. The Commission is also considering a scheme for lamb.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We intend to recover supervision costs throughout Great Britain from 1 January 1992, when beef carcase
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
grading will be introduced. We shall discuss detailed charging schemes with representative industry organisation before that scheme is introduced. We included lamb in the Bill to avoid having to come before the House with an identical small piece of legislation later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3 will provide statutory authority for payment of the national element of the suckler cow premium. Until now we have paid under the annual appropriation. That method of authorisation has been criticised, and we have taken the advantage of this Bill to correct that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Community suckler cow premium scheme was introduced in 1980. It is designed to help support specialist beef producers who receive a Community payment for suckler cows kept for rearing beef cows. Member states may add a discretionary national payment; Britain does so now under the authority of the appropriation Acts. The Bill will enable Britain to make regulations providing for that payment and setting out the relevant terms and conditions. The details of the payment do not change; only the legal base on which it rests changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the more picturesque part of the Bill, which provides statutory authority for payments currently made to the New Forest verderers, also under the authority of the annual appropriation Acts. We do propose not to alter those payments but to put them on a better legal basis. The verderers are of ancient origin, but their current functions are set out in the New Forest Acts of 1877 to 1970. They have responsibilities for conservation and recreation as well as administering rights of common. They are unpaid but have administrative costs that have risen substantially with the increasing pressure of public use on the forest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Forestry Commission agreed with the Treasury in 1973 that it would make an annual ex gratia contribution to those expenses. The sums have never exceeded £10,000 a year, but they are important if the verderers are to carry out their wider responsibilities. Clause 4 provides the appropriate statutory authority for such payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 5 sets out the short title and defines the geographical extent of the Bill. Its provisions do not extend to Northern Ireland, but parallel legislation will be introduced to cover carcase grading inspection charges and the suckler cow premium. The clause provides also for the commencement of clause 2. Clauses 3 and 4 will come into force immediately after Royal Assent, since the payments are being made already, and that is normal practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is short, useful and beneficial and I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.42 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter L. Pike 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Burnley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for explaining the Bill and for sending us the notes on clauses, which have been helpful. We agreed to this Second Reading Committee because we do not believe that the Bill is contentious. Therefore, I do not intend to prolong the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are grateful also to the Minister for explaining how the hybrid provision arising from clause 1(6) and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0509">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
the implications for the memorandum will be dealt with, assuming that the Bill has a Second Reading. That could have given us cause for debate today, but the procedure that has been agreed eliminates the need for us to argue about it now. The Minister clarified that the clearing banks involved with the Bank of England would not withdraw overnight their involvement. The change will be implemented in an orderly and sensible way that will allow the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation to continue to function and provide the same service. I do not doubt the Minister's remarks on those clearing banks, and I am sure that the Government are just as anxious as we are about problems arising from a sudden change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall refer in the main to the Agriculture Mortgage Corporation, because the minister rightly pointed out that the Scottish counterpart is already largely deregulated and is in a different position at present. I shall therefore concentrate on the AMC. We recognise that during the time that it has existed as a centralised organisation it has had a low overhead cost structure. I am sure that we all want to see that maintained. We obviously want it to continue to provide the type of medium and long-term finance to the industry that it has been able to do, and at competitive rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all recognise that times change, and the AMC certainly supports the Bill and recognises that the format that will result will enable it to meet the challenges of the 1990s and to move on into the next century rather than being tied rigidly by the framework that was envisaged. It has served well to date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many points that I could have made had this been a contentious issue. The Opposition do not intend to divide the Committee. The issues will properly be discussed during the Bill's Committee stage. We are not opposed to the direction in which the Bill is going, and it is not my wish to prolong our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.47 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Conway 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Shrewsbury and Atcham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) has encouraged me to make a long contribution, but preferably in the Corridor. I promise not to delay hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, may I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for his clarification in his opening remarks and especially for the notes on clauses, which were particularly helpful. I should like to comment briefly on clause 1 on the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
AMC. It will be welcomed, and it is encouraging, especially as all parties are urging farming communities to diversify. The flexibility will be welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I also put on record my surprise that no representative from the Liberal Democrats is present? The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Livsey) is a member of the Committee: his party claims to have an interest in agriculture and rural affairs, and his discourtesy to the Committee and to the farming community should not go unnoticed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, may I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to tell the Committee about the EC implications of clause 1? Is it an area that is likely to cause us difficulties in future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.48 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not introducing this because of any pressure from the Community. There is an indirect EC implication, and it is a technical one. Both these bodies are currently exempt under the Community credit institutions directive and the Community bank accounts directive. That exemption is likely to end after deregulation. Both corporations are perfectly content that it should happen. We are not doing this because of any obligation of Community law but as part of our belief that we need to provide a more diversified service to agriculture. These are the obvious vehicles for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Antony Buck 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Colchester, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister has been most helpful in explaining the purpose of the measure and, as other hon. Members have said, it has also helped to have the notes on clauses. Could he tell us the attitude of the National Farmers Union towards the measure? Have there been any consultations with its representatives? I understand that they are content with it, but perhaps he could confirm that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My experience is that, if the NFU is not content with something, it lets one know quite quickly. We have received no such indication.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
