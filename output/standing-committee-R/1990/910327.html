Under your chairmanship, Mr. Leadbitter, I hope to be expeditious although not entirely brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will enable the United Kingdom to ratify the Lugano convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, which was adopted on 16 Sepember 1988 and by the United Kingdom on 18 September 1989. The parties to the Convention are the 12 member states of the European Community and the six member states of the European Free Trade Association; Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. We share the desire of other EC member states to strengthen relations with EFTA countries. Formal negotiations with them to create a single European economic area began last June and good progress has been made, but there are other areas of co-operation and this convention, in the legal sphere, is a very good example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The convention will make it easier to enforce civil judgments between member states of the EC and those of EFTA. Along with the principles of free movement of persons, services, capital and goods we now have free movement of judgments. Increased social and commercial mobility make it more important to have an efficient system for taking judgments obtained in one country and enforcing them in another. If a person wins a case here against a Swiss company that has no assets in this country, he or she wants to be able to go to Switzerland and enforce that judgment there without any further complication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other part of the convention lays down rules for ascertaining in which state's courts cases are initially to be heard and determined. In the past, a court that was being asked to enforce a judgment from another country had to be satisfied that the court in that other country had jurisdiction to hear the case. Now it will no longer have to do so, because jurisdiction, having already been determined by the convention, can be taken as having been properly asserted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lugano convention is modelled on the existing EC convention which deals with jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments. That convention, the Brussels convention, was made part of our law by the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982. The two conventions are extremely similar and their provisions follow the same numbering. There are some differences between them, but given that the Lugano Convention was negotiated by 18 separate states it is a considerable achievement to have so few.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the final text of the Lugano convention was adopted, the Government consulted people with a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
particular interest in the subject. As expected, the convention was warmly received. Further consultation before the introduction of the Bill produced the same response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the Bill is taken up with setting out the full text of the Lugano convention. Fortunately, few operative provisions are necessary, since the Bill amends, rather than re-enacts, the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982. Practitioners will, therefore, need only one Act on European civil jurisdiction and judgments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's central provision is clause 1, which adds a new subsection 3A to the 1982 Act to give the Lugano Convention the force of law in the United Kingdom. The new subsection 3B of the 1982 Act deals with the interpretation of the Lugano convention and provides that, in accordance with protocol No. 2 to the convention, our courts must have regard to principles laid down by the courts of other contracting states when interpreting the convention. That provision differs from that of the Brussels convention, over which the European Court of Justice has jurisdiction, as it is a purely EC instrument. When interpreting that convention our courts must have regard to decisions of the European Court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The involvement of EFTA states in the Lugano convention has resulted in there being no place for the European Court in interpreting the convention. Nevertheless, all the parties agreed that uniform interpretation was desirable and administrative machinery has therefore been set up by protocol No. 2 to ensure that courts know about relevant decisions on the convention which have been made in other contracting states. Following our previous legislative practice, for example in the Contracts (Applicable Law) Act 1990, the new subsection 3B provides that when construing the provisions of the convention out courts may consider the commentary on it which has been prepared by two of its negotiators. The commentary has a semi-offical status, having been considered by all the Governments of the contracting states before it was published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 also inserts in section 9 of the 1982 Act a new subsection (1A) to draw particular attention to article 54B of the convention, which deals with the important question whether a particular case is to be governed by the Lugano convention or by the Brussels convention. Neither the Lugano convention nor the Brussels convention, as amended, contains any provision on the territorial extent, other than with regard to Northern Ireland. Each contracting state will therefore be left free to choose to which, if any, of its territories the conventions should extend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The convention falls into two main parts: The first, consisting of articles 2 to 24, deals with jurisdiction, and the second, consisting of articles 25 to 49, deals with the recognition and enforcement of judgment. The convention's application to civil and commercial matters means that it will cover a wide range of subjects, including commercial, insurance, consumer and other contracts, personal injuries, maintenance, land and trusts. Some areas, including arbitration, taxation, insolvency and divorce are excluded, as they are usually covered by special agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first principle governing a court's jurisdiction is that a defendant is to be sued in the courts of the contracting state in which he is domiciled. For the purposes of our law, an individual is domiciled here if he is resident in the United
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0533">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
Kingdom and the nature and circumstances of his residence indicate that he has a substantial connection with the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The convention lays down rules of jurisdiction under which a defendant may, or must, also be sued in the courts of another contracting state. In contract cases, for example, the courts in the state where the contract is to be performed have jurisdiction, as well as those of the defendant's domicile, and in tort cases the courts in the state in which the harmful event occurred also have jurisdiction. There are special rules for contracts of employment on which the lugano convention and the Brussels Convention vary slightly. There are also special rules in both conventions for insurance contracts and consumer contracts, and those rules are designed to protect the insured party and the consumer. Rights in land will usually be determined by the courts of the state in which the land is situated. There is an exception to this in both conventions, although they differ in detail, in the case of holiday homes when the landlord and the tenant do not reside in the same state as the holiday home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In certain circumstances, the parties themselves may agree that a particular court may have jurisdiction. The Government set great store by that, as it will mean that the commercial court will still be able to hear cases where the parties wish it to have jurisdiction, although neither may be domiciled here. The retention of this provision in the Lugano convention is to be welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim of the enforcement provisions is to make the enforcement of civil judgments between one contracting state and another as simple as possible. The substance of a judgment cannot be questioned by the enforcing court and, because the convention has laid down rules of jurisdiction, only in exception circumstances may the enforcing court refuse to enforce the judgment on the grounds that the issuing court had no jurisdiction to hear the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, the relationship between the Lugano convention and the Brussels convention is governed by article 54B. I know, Mr Leadbitter, that you will consider that to be especially important. Put simply, the Brussels convention will continue to apply in legal relations solely between parties from ED member states. The Lugano convention will be applied where the defendant is domiciled in an EFTA state, where such state has exclusive jurisdiction under that convention, and where the parties have agreed to confer jurisdiction on the courts of such a state. In matters of enforcement it will be applied where either the state of the original court or the state of the enforcing court is an EFTA state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lugano convention will come into force on the first day of the third month following rarification by one EC member state and one EFTA state. Thereafter, it will come into force, for a particular contracting state, three months after that state has ratified it. It is unusual for only two ratifications to be needed in the first place, and that indicates the contracting states' keenness that the convention come into force without delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another desirable feature of the convention is that under article 62, provided that all the members of the EC and EFTA agree, countries other than member states of the EC and of EFTA may accede to the convention. When we were
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
negotiating the convention, we had in mind the possibility of Commonwealth countries joining it; countries in eastern Europe may now also be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lugano convention is a valuable achievement. It will operate with the Brussels convention to create a virtually uniform system of civil jurisdiction and enforcement of judgments throughout most of Europe, and will play an important part in strengthening European legal and economic co-operation in an important area. The Bill is a straightforward measure and is a necessary part of that process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the unusual provision in clause 1(1) which states that the courts may have regard to
	<br><q><p>"the report on the Lugano convention by Mr. P. Jenard and Mr. G. Möller (which is reproduced in the Official Journal of the Communities of 28th July 1990".</p></q>
That is unusual because in British statute law, courts do not usually have regard to commentaries or White Papers or other material. Instead, they look at the literal interpretation of the statute and then apply it, sometimes with common sense and sometimes without.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the reasons why the legislation of this country is so lengthy and detailed is that the legislature and judiciary are constantly battling over interpretation and intention. The courts fail to interpret our intentions. They take the statutes literally and there is very little dialogue between the judges and the legislature. That is a great pity. I am in favour of a court interpreting the spirit of legislation and looking at other material that has been approved by Parliament and which might be helpful. I hope that this is a precedent that will be followed in wholly domestic legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that other countries, especially Commonwealth and eastern European countries, will accede to the convention and become encompassed by the legislation. Such legislation is the mark of the highest form of civilisation. Civilisation means art and literature. One can admire the music, for example, of another country and read its literature, enjoy its poetry and use its language, but still be at war with that country. It is a greater mark of civilisation to recognise the civilised system of law and the courts of that country and for that to be reciprocated. That commends the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
