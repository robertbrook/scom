	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee recommends that the Census (Confidentiality) Bill [	<i>Lords</i>] ought to be read a Second time.</p></blockquote>
My first duty is to welcome you back, Mr. Hughes, after a period in which you were not on the Chairmen's Panel. I am very pleased to be sitting on a Committee under your chairmanship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill represents the final preparations for the 1991 census, which will take place in April. It is important to stress the importance of the census process. It provides us with our only complete record of the makeup of those who live in this country, and it is an essential basis for planning a range of services, especially in the public sector, although information is widely used in the private sector, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain why no mention was made of the necessity for the Bill when the census orders were laid down 13 or 14 months ago? Why is it being rushed through at this late stage? I note from this year's report on statistical information in the Department's booklet that it is anticipated that the Bill will be on the statute book early this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would never try to anticipate the decisions of the House. However, it is important that the protection provided by the Bill should be in place before the census begins. It should apply not only to England, Wales and Scotland, but to Northern Ireland under clause 2. The Bill has been introduced because we reviewed the confidentiality assurances under existing law and concluded that further steps had to be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The census is an important process, and the Bill will provide all the safeguards that are necessary to ensure that the information that the public give as part of the census process will be treated confidentially, as they are entitled to expect. It is common ground that, whenever personal information is provided to any agency, the person giving it is entitled to expect that it will be treated confidentially. There are extensive provisions in common law and in other statutes to provide that those who gather information are under an obligation to observe confidentiality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The census is different from any other information gathering about the population because it is the only time when people are required compulsorily to give information which then becomes the subject of a duty of confidentiality. In recognition of the compulsory nature of the gathering process, the census has always been the subject of particular and specific statutory guarantees on the confidentiality of the information. Historically, such guarantees have rested on two provisions—section 8(2) of the Census Act 1920 and section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The Committee will know that section 2 of the Official Secrets Act has now been repealed. The review to which I referred revealed that that repeal left two gaps in the confidentiality provisions that the Bill is designed to plug. The first gap arises because section 8(2) of the Census Act 1920 applies only to staff employed in the taking of a census and not to other staff who are employed by the census offices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second gap arises because the relevant section of the Census Act 1920 protects only information in the census, and does not protect information given as a result of census tests or census related surveys. The Bill is the result of our recognition that the repeal of section 2 of the Official Secrets Act leave those two specific gaps in the statutory confidentiality guarantees provided by the 1920 Act. We recognise also that, in the special circumstances of a compulsory gathering of information from every resident of the United Kingdom, those gaps must be filled and adequate statutory guarantees must be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1(2) specifies the people who may legitimately have access to census information. They are the Registrars-General, people under their control and people who supply services to either Registrar-General. Clause 1(6) will ensure that all people who are working or have worked for the Registrars-General are included in the provision. Clause 1(3) preserves an existing provision and will catch people who pass on information acquired as a result of unlawful disclosure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Defences are provided in clause 1(4) for people who reasonably and genuinely believe that information that they have disclosed does not contravene the 1920 Act. Clause 1(5) deals with penalties. Those provisions are designed specifically to deal with the gaps in the definition of the people to whom the statutory guarantee of confidentiality applies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill also contains a definition of census information. It extends the term to cover information collected in census-related surveys and in the census tests that the Registrars-General carry out in preparation for a census proper. That is designed to fill the second gap. That definition under clause 1(7) refers to information acquired in the course of the discharge of functions under sections 2 and 4 of the Census Act 1920. Under section 2, the Registrars-General conduct their census tests and take the census. Under section 4, information is collected in surveys to help the Registrars-General to report on the census results. We will be following previous practice by holding a voluntary sample survey after the 1991 census to check the accuracy of the census. We plan to collect census information from members of households who are away from home over the census period, but who agree to fill in the form when they return home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Census information is further defined to include information collected in follow-up surveys that are carried out under section 5 of the Census Act 1920 and are directed to samples of people or households selected by reference to the answers given in the census returns. We have taken the opportunity to focus the criminal sanctions contained in the Bill on the only information that really needs that protection—that is, personal information. That is defined as
	<br><blockquote><p>"information which relates to an identifiable person or household".</p></blockquote>
Section 8(2) of the Census Act 1920 protects any information obtained in the course of taking a census. That would, for example, currently cover, at least technically, a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0515">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
member of the census office who told a member of the public how many census forms were to be printed. We have therefore focused the criminal sanction on information about which the statutory guarantee of confidentiality matters—that is, information of a personal nature, which the person who fills in the census return has a legitimate right to expect to be treated as confidential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members have expressed concern about the inclusion in the Bill of the concept of lawful authority of disclosure. An employee of the census office may have lawful authority to pass confidential information to someone else. That is nothing new. The provision is in the original statute—indeed, it is hard to imagine how any census could ever be collected if it were not. The most important occasion on which advantage is taken of that provision is when one census office employee passes confidential information to another employee. Without the concept of lawful authority it would be impossible for an enumerator to pass confidential information to the person responsible for the area in which he collected it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lawful authority provision is essential to allow information to pass within the census offices. It is needed also so that census offices can pass formerly confidential information to the Public Record Office at the end of the 100-year protection period. Further, it is needed to allow the enforcement of the compulsory nature of the census. If an individual does not adequately complete the census form, information that would otherwise be confidential may have to be revealed in court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, information on postcode areas will now be made available. Will the Minister advise whether the lawful authority provision is the basis on which such information will be supplied to public bodies or sold to the general public?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is not correct. We are discussing lawful authority to pass on personal confidential census information. The publication of aggregated census information on a postcode basis is specifically bound by the provisions of the confidentiality guarantee. It is part of the output of the census office as a result of the aggregation process. The publication of returns on a postcode basis is covered by the confidentiality provisions, and is not one of the exemptions for which lawful authority would be necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we dealt with the census order, I questioned the then Minister about the problems of publishing information on the basis of postcodes when there is a small number of categories within a particular postcode. It was explained that numbers would be slightly distorted—for example, a two might become a three. However, it would still be fairly easy to identify groups of people by running a check through a computer against an electoral roll or a poll tax register.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must disagree with the hon. Gentleman that the publication of small area statistics of that nature can lead to the reliable identification of a citizen's confidential census information. The hon. Gentleman referred to the blurring process, which is designed specifically to obscure personal information. He will be aware also of two other provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, small-area statistics are released only if the population and number of households in an area exceed specific thresholds. There must be a minimum number of
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
households in an area before small-area statistics can be released. Secondly, standard census tables are designed for areas below local authority level, so that instances in which a count of the number of people with a particular combination produces very small numbers are kept to an absolute minimum. The Registrar-General has defined that as defence in depth, and it will act against the danger identified by the hon. Gentleman. It is a danger concerned more with the publication of census output than with guarantees to the citizen who fills in a census return.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Audrey Wise 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Preston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister help us by giving details of the numbers involved? I admit that I do not know how many people or households are within a postcode area, so it is difficult for me to follow the exchange between my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) and the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that the minimum area for which any census information would be published is one that contains 16 households and 50 people. In that context, there are the additional safeguards that there should be blurrring and that any information published about such a small area would be kept to an absolute minimum. There would be resistance to publishing it unless it was clearly necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This short Bill completes the guarantee of confidentiality that anyone completing a census return is entitled to expect, bearing in mind the compulsory nature of that return. Census offices have a distinguished record of observing confidentiality and I am not aware of any significant breaches arising from information in earlier censuses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made much of the plugging of gaps in previous legislation. Does one of the main gaps to be plugged relate to information that could fall into the hands of community charge registrars? Is not the measure tied to that, as masses of people might not complete census forms if they felt that the information might fall into the hands of poll tax registrars?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to get into an argument about whether people should or should not fill in their community charge registration forms. I can give the Committee the absolute assurance that, under the existing legislation perfected by the Bill, information provided to the census authorities cannot be passed on to a community charge registration officer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is nonsense, because the Minister told us that it would be available in small-data information. A poll tax registration officer may get census statistics that involve 16 houses and show that there are 30 adults in that area. He will check his returns and note that they show only 15 adults. That will immediately draw his attention to a specific problem of under-registration in that area. He would be crazy if he did not use that information as a tool.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That intervention raises a number of points. First, the census information relating to small-area statistics is likely to emerge a significant period after the currency—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How long?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0516">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall seek advice about the earliest date on which the smallest area statistics could be published after the taking of a census. Clearly, they will not be the first tables that are published, and they are likely to come out after the currency of the community charge register.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understood that the Minister claimed that all the census information would be out within two years of its collection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At that point, it would be one year beyond the currency of a community charge register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Among further points to be made is that the hon. Gentleman cited an example of 16 households and 30 people. I mentioned a test of 16 houses and 50 people, so in that example the information would not be provided on a small-area basis because it would be too small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To defend the point on small-area statistics, I reiterate that, there will be a blurring process and community charge registration officers would be looking at out-of-date statistics. They could not rely on having accurate figures on the total number of people resident in those small areas on the date when the census was taken. Other sources of information would, of course, be substantially more reliable. Furthermore, it would remain true that, if there were a difference, census officers would be under an obligation not to discharge any information that allowed them to identify where and how the difference arose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Wise</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For clarification, does that figure include children? Are they 50 adults, or 50 people of any age?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but it is a both—and provision that the test must be of 16 households and 50 individuals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Wise</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of any age?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, of any age.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If legislation is needed to protect the census from the community charge registrar, is not legislation needed to protect the electoral register from the community charge registrar?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting question, but it does not arise from the long title of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leyton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may be confident that the information cannot be abused by the poll tax registrar or anyone else and that individual privacy cannot be disrupted, but what sums has he done to confirm that view?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The relevant study is simply to examine the legal obligations under which census officers will work. Anyone working in a census office or under the control of the Registrar-General will be debarred from providing that information to community charge registration officers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but there are important implications for privacy, which should have been assessed in detail. Has the Minister not undertaken any study of how privacy can be secured? Are there no risks? Has he consulted the Data Protection Registrar? Has he asked the British Computer Society to undertake an independent review?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not specifically in relation to the community charge registration officer. However, we have consulted the British Computer Society on the security of the computer programmes that underlie the information
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
gathering process. That will be reported to the House. In view of the unease expressed on that subject, I hope that that report will be available before the Bill is considered in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, most enumerators are being recruited now.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeff Rooker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Perry Barr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say what a pleasure it is to serve on a Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Hughes? I may astonish the Committee by saying that the Opposition warmly welcome the Bill. The Bill is necessary, but it is unfortunate that the subject could not have been included as a clause in the new official secrets legislation. That would have obviated the need to take up the time of the House. The subject could have been debated adequately as part of other legisltion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not debating the census. The House did that 18 months ago when some, if not all, of the issues that might be raised in the Committee were dealt with. I am the only Committee member whose constituency formed part of the 1989 test census. At that time I advised my constituents not to co-operate with the voluntary census. Indeed, I published 20,000 letters and a parliamentary question on House of Commons paper advising my constituents not to co-operate, as, unlike this time, there was no legal requirement to do so. I thought that my constituency had been picked out unfairly because of the poll tax. I made no direct connection between the test census and that tax, but said that non-co-operation was a way of sticking two fingers up to those who brought in the poll tax. I also made it clear that census is a vital instrument of social policy and that, in the real census of 1991, we should have to cooperate because that is a legal requirement and a social duty in a democracy. I noted from the test census response rate that in Birmingham—which also included the Small Heath constituency-42 per cent. responded, which is well below average, so at least my constituents listen to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1989, there has been no evidence of any breach of confidentiality after the test census. Neither my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Howell) nor I have received a single complaint about the test census. There was only one, very minor, breach of confidentiality many years ago. I have read the Lords' debate on the Bill, and the answers Baroness Hooper gave by letter to some of the questions asked in it and I have absolute confidence in the Registrar-General's ability to ensure that the 1991 census does its intended job and protects all the private and personal information that will be given by our fellow citizens which is needed to conduct
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0517">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
social policy and planning. On the evidence, they can give such information in the knowledge that it will not be abused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have discussed the matter with the electoral registration and the poll tax registration officers for Birmingham—which is the largest local authority—who each cover 750,000 adults. Unfortunately, they do not cover exactly the same people and one officer is trying to locate the other few thousand. Both said that they would not dream of using census information, for the reason that was given by the Under-Secretary to my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett), which was that, it would be out of date even for small post code areas. In answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Preston (Mrs. Wise), I have read that 250 to 400 is the basic post code size. Of course, the number varies and there are some very small post code areas, especially in rural areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Wise</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that households or people?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the number of households, or the number of letter boxes to which a post person delivers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both registration officers in Birmingham told me that they cannot use each others' register. I led for the Opposition on the original poll tax legislation and was surprised when the officers said that, due to the practicalities of the task, trying to use each other's information is a waste of time and money and that they will compile and use their individual registers in the best way that they can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that just because the computers in Birmingham cannot talk to one another, that does not mean that in other parts of the country people have not anticipated that computers could talk to each another?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am well aware of that. My hon. Friend said that people have anticipated that. To the best of my knowledge, nobody has done so and made it work in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raised these issues when we debated the community charge. There is a fear—albeit unfounded—that there is a connection and we must deal with that first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend acknowledge that an individual's census form could be traceable? Each form has a number, which could be computerised so that the form could be located. A poll tax collection officer may not use that as a first choice, but if he were keeenly looking for someone, he could trace him from his census form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My Hon. Friend should have thought about that before he made such an allegation. He must think about professional competence and what he has implied about local authority staff in his area. My hon. Friend cannot seriously maintain that professionally qualified local government staff would break the law. They do not do that, and no one has tried or is trying to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share my hon. Friend's concerns about privacy, but it is no good raising a red herring that has no validity which may discourage our fellow citizens from co-operating with the census. If people do not co-operate, we shall not get health clinics and schools in the right places in our constituences for the next generation. My hon. Friend should have a chat with the local authority staff in his borough. I am sure that they are not doing what he
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
described and we know of no borough where they are trying to do that, because in so doing they would break the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any case, the names and addresses on the census form are detached—they are not fed into the computer. That is the point of protecting personal information. Names and addresses are not necessary for the purpose of the census. There is a legal requirement for people to co-operate, and the names and addresses are supplied so that checks can be carried out in surveys afterwards, to see whether the forms are filled in correctly, whether mistakes were made or whether people were not at their homes. The names and addresses are not used for the census, so they are certainly not used for the poll tax or other purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not my job to make the Minister's case, but the census is a matter that transcends the Government machine from a party point of view. The Registrar-General does not consider himself to be an adjunct of the party of the Government of the day. He has a different function which is to serve the governance of the country—local authorities of all persuasions, central Government and other areas of society which, for the conduct of business and to plan for the future, need information about the 50 million-odd people on our island. We need information so that we can plan public expenditure and the use of resources. It is a fluke and a consequence of history that the role of the Registrar-General is attached to the Department of Health. I am glad that it is not attached to the Home Office, or there would be fears, unnecessary though those may be. There is an extra safeguard—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is putting forward the historical argument, which I accept. However, he should be aware that the Government have increasingly demanded that people should make profits out of selling the public good. What worries us is that the small census data will be sold to commerical undertakings that will make profits from them. That is why we asked whether the public service ethos that used to surround the census has been eroded. I accept my hon. Friend's argument, but he should be aware of the way in which the Government started to subvert the whole process for private profit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what my hon. Friend has said, but it does not relate to the protection of personal information provided by our fellow citizens. That issue of policy may divide us from the Government, but it does not affect the way in which our constituents will be treated. We want them to be assured that the information they provide on the census form will not be divulged to any private commercial operation or any instrument of Government other than the census office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People have that great fear about the census. At one time, the Government proposed to sell the poll tax register, but abandoned the idea at the last moment. The question of whether information should be sold is one matter, but confidentiality is another. The point of the Bill is to reinforce existing protection of private information to ensure that it is concreted with a grid round the names and addresses of people in households, especially in small areas, so that those details cannot be divulged. People should be able to feel that they can complete, in the privacy of their homes, a form which no one other than census officials will see. They believe that those officials need that information to ensure that their children's and grandchildren's schools will be sited in the right places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0518">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
When it comes down to basics, the main users of census information are health authorities and local authorities, notwithstanding its use by commercial operations. Not even central Government use it so widely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to the electoral register. It would be wholly inappropriate for any electoral registration officer to use census information, but the electoral register to be published tomorrow is already out of date by 7 per cent. Three million people will be missed off the register, regardless of those who have moved since October. As democrats, that should concern us all. In other words, the register is out of date before it is published and the idea that there can be a match of information to seek out one person beggars belief because it will not work like that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government were to devote as many resources into making an accurate electoral register as they have devoted to making accurate community charge or poll tax registers and the census, I would be very happy. I believe that Home Office Ministers share the view that insufficient resources are provided for ensuring an accurate electoral register in this country. I repeat that the electoral register is out of date by 7 per cent. and that 3 million will be completely missing from it—and that figure does not relate to those who have moved. That register is due to be published this week and the Boundary Commission will start work next Thursday on redrawing all our boundaries. If that does not give all hon. Members pause for thought, I do not know what will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity for this debate, but the Minister should have explained more clearly to the Committee that the Bill is the result of failures on the part of the Government. Had they looked carefully at the Official Secrets Act 1911 they would have realised that they needed legislation at that point. It would have been rather better when they brought the census proposal forward in 1989–90 if they had made it clear that they intended to propose further legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the measure because it seeks to correct a mistake, but I regret that it does not go far enough. My hon. Friend the Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) and I have tabled a reasoned amendment because we do not want to support the Bill until the Government have dealt with the problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are faced with a major problem because I suspect that confidence in the census has steadily declined. There is evidence that an increasing number of people have refused to co-operate with it in recent years and there is also a question about its accuracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acted as a census enumerator in 1961, in a sample census in 1996, and in 1971. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I thank the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick) for that aside. I may not be especially literate, but I am fairly numerate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked to act as a census enumerator on those occasions as one tends to be asked back if one has done a reasonable job. Without breaching confidentiality about statistical information provided on the basis of small areas, the first time that I performed that task I lived in the centre of Manchester. The housing in the area where I worked as an enumerator was pretty appalling, although I saw worse housing when I was a student in Birmingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
I was interested to note that a substantial number of the people from whom I collected forms could not read or write easily, but there was a very high level of co-operation. Almost everyone had their forms ready for me to collect on the Monday following the census and I found it an easy way of earning money. I felt that everyone believed in the census because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Perry Bar (Mr. Rooker) said, they thought that it would ensure better government of the country. They were happy to co-operate and took considerable trouble to help with the completion of the forms of neighbours whom they knew found reading and writing difficult or who were elderly and arthritic. My impression was that the forms had been filled in with extreme accuracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had more or less the same response in another part of Manchester when I did that job in 1966. However, 1971, I performed the task in an area which had a fairly high number of immigrant households. Some of the occupants found it difficult to complete the forms and although a lot of effort went into printing them in various languages it did not seem to make it easier for them. The area also contained a substantial number of bedsitters occupied by people on benefits of one form or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The level of co-operation was nowhere near as high. Not only did I have the impression that some people were trying hard to avoid returning the forms, but I felt that many of them were not completed accurately. The point that I stress to my hon. Friend the Member for Perry Barr is that the public respond in two different ways. One is to refuse to complete the forms, make a stand and to go to court. The other is not to fill in the forms accurately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an enumerator can perceive massive discrepancies, there is a procedure for drawing that to the attention of his or her supervisor. When that occurred in my case, I felt that the matter was out of my hands. In most cases, the enumerators are keen to get the job done, but if someone insists that only two people live in a house, or that only two reside there on a Saturday night and a Sunday morning and the enumerators believe that it was occupied by six or seven people, they are likely to feel that it is some of their business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not help with the census in 1981 but my father did. He found that his belief in the accuracy of the completed forms was futher diminished and that people were worried about the census.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential to have a good census in our country and that will depend on the public believing that the information that they provide will be confidential. I suggest that the Government's actions have steadily eroded that belief because they have chosen to sell information. It should not be sold and I advise the Minister that, even at this late stage, he could allay many people's fears if he would make it clear that it would not be sold on the basis of small postal code areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand from the Government's report that they hope to get an income of about £29 million from sales in 1993–94. That is a considerable amount. Presumably, it is worth while for commercial organisations to buy that information. Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether that income would result from charging by Government departments or whether it will come from sales to the general public. I understand that much of it will come from sales to commercial organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How has confidentiality been eroded? The Minister made a good point when he referred to the length of time it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0519">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
took for the information to be made available. In the past, information on small areas was not made available for about five years. It was not linked to postal codes. I do not agree with the theory that it was possible for someone to manually match up information from postal codes, from telephone directories and information from poll tax electoral registers. It would not be worth the effort to take such action because of the delay in the information becoming available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the position is changing. Information on postal codes is made available. It will be relatively easy to feed into a computer information on postal codes and information will be made available much sooner than used to be the case. Therefore, it will be possible—probably within two years of the census taking place—to produce fairly accurate lists that can be supplied to commercial organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we discussed the census order, the Minister implied that it would be an advantage as it would reduce the amount of junk mail that people received. He suggested that such communications would not be junk mail if they were well targeted. In other words, if someone was the sort of person who was likely to buy a Volvo and he received by post a brochure advertising Volvos, that would not be junk mail, but accurate marketing. I do not accept that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I already receive far too much junk mail. I am worried about the prospect of commercial organisations running information through their compuers on, say, all the small areas of Stockport. They could decide that the characteristics of the small areas were such that one area should be targeted for the sale of yuppie-type goods, while another area with a high proportion of elderly residents should be targeted for the sale of thermal underwear or holidays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider the ways in which organisations could use the information and how such a practice will erode the confidentiality of the system. People will be able to use the published profile of postal code areas for marketing purposes. Although I do not like such a practice, I am not making a tremendous fuss about it because the more reputable marketing organisations will allow people to have their names excluded from their mailing lists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the problem of red-lining, many of my constituents are upset because the Post Office has given them a specific postal code that links them to other areas. Insurance companies and sometimes building societies and banks offering mortgages take into account the profile of a certain area in which people live. Let us consider single parents living in a small postal code area. They would know that, by filling in the forms, their status would be made clear, and as a result, their credit rating level might be reduced. People would begin to wonder what was going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reality is that once small areas are identified, that lends itself to companies increasing the premiums for specific areas. That already happens on the basis of postal codes, and it is a worrying development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we discussed the census order, the Minister said that a more accurate profile would help the banks and building societies to decide to whom to offer credit. I should be most upset if I thought that, as a result of the information that I and my neighbours had provided on the census form, we were influencing the credit prospects of people living in our neighbourhood for the following five or six years. I would be even more alarmed if I thought that
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
my insurance premium would rise because of the profile of information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Information such as the number of cars in an area is being fed into computers. I should have thought that that information would give considerable advantages to those who take commercial decisions and it could lead them to discriminate against particular areas in towns. The House of Commons should not approve of such a measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should not encourage such practices. If someone believes that census information will find its way back into his credit rating, insurance premiums, and so on, he will start to worry, and ask himself why he should provide census information if he will be disadvantaged by it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Perry Barr will say that if people do not provide information, we shall not know whether certain areas have a high proportion of single parents or a low proportion of cars, so we cannot plan public policy. I accept that argument, but it is unfortunate that in providing information for public policy, that information could allow others to make further profits. The Minister must examine red-lining carefully. He may say that problems will occur only two or three years afterwards, but my constituents are upset about the postal code problems at present. No one asks whether they are good people to whom to lend money or whether they are insurance worthy, but they are classified with their neighbours and decisions are taken on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also worried about race relations. I understand that the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys is worried about the public reaction to census information about ethnic groups. We all expect that the proportion of ethnic minorities in the population as a whole will have risen substantially, and I fear that some people may try to sensationalise those figures when they are published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fairly obvious where the main concentrations of people from ethnic minorities live, but there are other areas where that is not so obvious. If information from small postal code areas is published, it will be easier for people who want to cause mischief to pick out those areas of towns where a high proportion of people from ethnic minorities live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about some of the racial attacks that take place in my constituency. Frequently, I hear people saying that they are determined to move away from areas where other people from ethnic minorities live because they want to reduce the possibility of attack. Substantial numbers of people from ethnic minorities live in streets in my constituency where there are no problems of harassment. National Front leaflets are not shoved through their front doors, unlike in some other areas where ethnic groups suffer from such abuse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend speaks for his own area, but that is the opposite of what happens in my constituency, in which there are four large wards—20,000 people in each. In Handsworth ward, I am part of the ethnic minority. The problems that my hon. Friend described do not occur in Handsworth, but they do occur in outer wards, where the ethnic minority is about 5 per cent. The people are vulnerable because they have dispersed to the outskirts of Birmingham. Racial attacks do not happen in the inner city because of the community spirit that exists there. That is the reverse of what happens in my hon. Friend's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0520">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
constituency. His remarks struck a chord because of that difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to sound racist, but perhaps that suggests that there are different characteristics between people in the west midlands and those in Denton and Reddish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The majority of my constituents treat their neighbours as they find them, rather than on the basis of the colour of their skin. I do not know of any one group of neighbours in my constituency organising a petition or making a fuss because of someone moving into their street. People are treated strictly on the basis of who they are, which makes it much harder for those who want to stir up trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that people can look through the electoral register and can sometimes indentify ethnic minorities by their names. If small census figures are to be published, people will be able to see that there is a higher proportion of immigrants in a certain area. They might then use that informationm to behave in an objectionable way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By the time census information is available I hope that the poll tax will be a thing of the past. We should try to ensure that problems do not occur. A poll tax registration officer would be neglecting his duty if he did not study the census information to see whether there was a substantial discrepancy between the number of adults that he believes are registered in the area and those in the census return. If the census return shows that there are 500 adults in the area and only 300 appear in the poll tax register, that is the area in which the registration officer should concentrate his efforts, rather than in areas where the figures tally. That would be a simple tool for him to use to check the figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are trying to protect the way in which census information is collected, but they should be examining matters such as the commercial sale of information. I do no believe that a public service should be something that makes a profit or draws income. Census information helps towards good government of the country—it should not be sold to pay for the costs of collection, nor should it be used to disdvantage people—by creating racial harassment, junk mail or red-lining areas, so that people must pay higher insurance premiums or are refused credit cards or mortgages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about data protection and inquiries about information, especially when census information has been mixed up with information from electoral registers, telephone lists and so on? How far has the Data Protection Registrar been consulted and can he insist that the sale of information is carefully regulated?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us how may prosuctions there were of people who failed to provide the information, and how many were prosecuted for giving inaccurate information? Has the Minister any information about whether the problem with recent census returns has been that accuracy has gradually slipped as public confidence in the use of census information has slipped? Some people may make a protest and not return forms, but many more will return rather inaccurate forms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will make it clear that he accepts that there is a problem with the publicaton of census data based on postcodes. Will he consider sympathetically the amendments that we tabled when we thought that the Bill would be debated on the Floor of the House? That might speed up the remining stages and enable the claim that the

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true, but 	<i>Hansard</i> will show that the Minister referred to the Government having a good record on privacy. It is a dreadful record. I introduced my own privacy Bill for the poll tax because there were so many abuses. I remind the Minister of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. Schedule 5 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(10) The following paragraph shall be inserted after paragraph 13—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'13A.—(1) Regulations under this Schedule may include provision that a registration officer for a charging authority—
	<ol>
	<li>may supply relevant information to any person who requests it for a purpose not relating to this Part;</li>
	<li>may charge a prescribed fee for supplying the information;</li>
	<li>shall account for and pay any such fee to the charging authority for which he is the registration officer."'</li></ol></p></blockquote>
That is a blank cheque to sell information on the poll tax. My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) also referred to that point, saying that it was a source of concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have talked about the specifics of the census and of the poll tax. I shall come to the connection between the two shortly. I tabled several amendments that presumably will be dealt with on another day, but I shall refer to some of the general problems. The Government seem to regard the Bill as a technical measure. That is not appropriate. There needs to be open discussion on the principles that underpin the census, so that the air is cleared, public confidence is maintained and trust is restored. Otherwise, as my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish said, there will be dreadful distortions and health centres will not be set up where they are needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of my first intervention in the Minister's speech was to complain about how the Government have handled matters. I received a reply to a question on 16 January about the confidentiality review. I asked when the Minister expects to publish the independent confidentiality review mentioned in paragraph 29 of the White Paper and whether he will make a statement. The Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The report of the British Computer Society's independent review on the confidentiality arrangements for the computer processing of 1991 census data will be published, together with the Government's

	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
response, in a White Paper before the census, which is on 21 April this year."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 16 January 1991; Vol. 183, c. 516.]</p></blockquote>
That is all very well—rather, all is not very well. We are considering the confidentiality aspects of the Bill, yet the Government will not publish important data about the review of those arrangements until well into our proceedings. The Bill has already gone through the other place, where there was no chance to consider that review. We shall get the review late in the day, as a concession from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Gentleman that that report will be available by the time the Bill is considered in standing committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is immensely late in the day. We should have had it before now. This is the Second Reading stage and we are considering the principles of confidentiality, which is a crucial element of the census. This is not simply a waste of money, but a cover up. We should have had that report. The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mrs. Hicks) asked on 1 February whether the Minister had decided to obtain independent advice on the confidentiality for samples of anonymised records from the 1991 census. The Minister replied that Professor Holt, who is acting as technical assessor
	<br><blockquote><p>"will assess whether or not the arrangements ensure that any risk of inadvertent disclosure of census information about identifiable individuals is minimised"—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 1 February 1991; Vol 184, c. 	<i>682.</i>]</p></blockquote>
So there will be some disclosure. Whatever my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish said about it being against the law, there will be disclosures, because Professor Holt seeks only to minimise them. Again, that review is long after the House has considered the issue, so we shall not be able to see what the problems are. The Government have been negligent in their handling of the matter; if it is not neglect, it is a cover up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first concern is that the census may require personal information that is excessive for the purpose. One of the principles of the Data Protection Act 1984 is that information should not be collected that is excessive for the purpose. I am a little worried that that might not apply to census information. If we reduce the types of information collected and keep it to what is strictly necessary, we also reduce the potential for crime. It makes sense that the information should not be excessive for the purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whenever I see an application form which, like a census form, demands my name, address and date of birth—especially date of birth—I wonder whether the information being collected is excessive for the purpose. Clearly, the date of birth is sometimes needed, but it is a unique identifier which is used by the police and state organisations. For example, when the police vet teachers, social workers and medical staff who are seeking employment where they will have access to children, they require the applicants's date of birth so that they can check up on the person against the criminal record index in the police national computer. Similarly, when the secret services are authorised by Ministers to collect information about strikers or to tap into trade union computer systems to find out who the members are, they collate the information by using the surname and date of birth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasons for the collection of names, addresses and particularly dates of birth must be convincing. For the purposes of the census, the arguments are not convincing. The date of birth is not the only way to find the age profile
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
of the population. For Example, if we want the projected number of pensioners in the year 2000, we need only consider the statistics on the number of women now aged 50 and over, and the number of men now aged 55 and over. People could simply be asked their age, rather than their date of birth. That would reduce the risk of the information being used as a unique personal identifier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have a poor record on respect for privacy, especially in relation to date of birth. When the poll tax was introduced in Scotland, everyone had to give his or her date of birth. If there are two people of the same name, there may be a case for asking their dates of birth, but as a general requirement of the poll tax, it is unnecessary. Date of birth is one way that poll tax information can be used to identify people for other purposes, especially when it is linked to other information, and why it is attractive for other bodies to collect information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the implications for civil liberties, it is wrong to force individuals to divulge their date of birth to census officials, at least without a full explanation of why that information is required. I ask the Minister to provide such an explanation for the record, and to describe the statistics for which date of birth, rather than age, is necessary. If he says that date of birth will produce more accurate statistics, will he tell us how much more accurate those statistics are? They are unlikely to be significantly more accurate for the purposes of the census.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that it is necessary to support a longitudinal study—a study in which individuals with a birthday on a particular day become subject to a more detailed survey. I do not see why that could not be generated randomly, so that individuals with a birthday on a specified day could provide additional information. At least that would limit the number of days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people gave a false date of birth on their poll tax forms—especially in Scotland, If such false information is provided on a mass scale during the census, there is little point in conducting such an expensive exercise. The census will cost £135 million so we clearly want to avoid false information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The link between the poll tax and the census has already been mentioned. The two may remain inexorably linked in people's minds and that could lead to a boycott or the giving of false information. The Government use the population statistics derived from the census to estimate the number of people who should be on a local authority's poll tax register. That is how they produce the local authority's standard spending assessment. Post codes and area statistics have been mentioned. Poll tax officials could use them to check the numbers on poll tax registers. They could then concentrate on particular areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not convincingly answered the question about whether the people who collect the census information will previously have collected information for the poll tax register. I hope that the Minister will return to that issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that by repeating my comments I will give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks. I told the Committee earlier that the Registrar-General has not employed, and will not employ, as census enumerators people who were involved in compiling community charge registers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0522">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that important assurance, and hope that the Government will keep to it. Otherwise, the census would be undermined to an appalling extent. There is still a danger of individual tracing. The Government would not have asked Professor Holt to examine the possibility of minimising such disclosures if that were not the case. Individual tracing could be a last resort for a poll tax officer. It could even be done not by using census information directly, but by combining information from the area codes with other information. My hon. Friend the Member for Perry Barr says that that would be against the law, but I am afraid that such an exchange of information takes place in local government in many ways between many different groups.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend should think about what he is saying about the professional local government officers in his area. There is no evidence that such practices take place. If he has evidence that it takes place, he should give it to the appropriate authorities. He is casting aspersions on local government staff and his comments are unfair and unjustified. He should examine the details of the 200 hours of our deliberations on the poll tax legislation. The issue was a cause for worry, but there is no evidence to suggest that local government officers will knowingly breach the law. I cannot let my hon. Friend's comments pass without comment. The report of our proceedings will be read by people in local government and they deserve to know that no attack is being made on their integrity or professionalism although my hon. Friend implied that they would knowingly break the law in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not casting aspersions on the professionalism of government officers. Their work in my area is excellent. It was my hon. Friend the Member for Perry Barr who used the word "knowingly". I have worked in local government—in a rates office—and I know that information is exchanged. If social services departments, social security departments or the police ask for information, local government officers do not always refuse to provide it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Irvine Patnick: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hallam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They should.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What, even to the police? That does not happen. Information is passed on, albeit perhaps unknowingly. I would be happy if the report of our proceedings was read by local government officers. I would be especially happy if the Minister issued guidelines to all local government chief executives and health authority managers stating that, under no circumstances, should they disclose to the police, social services, social security or the secret services any information that they have on individuals. However, I doubt whether that will happen. I am not making a point about professionalism; I am arguing that information is exchanged as a matter of course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Disclosures in the census will be computerised. The number on the form will be computerised and can be accessible with some effort. I am not casting aspersions on local government officers. It is unlikely that such information will be passed on, but it could be. If it is, the implementation of the poll tax would despoil the census information and could lead to people providing misleading information. The £135 million to which I referred would be wasted. The Minister must be tighter in respect of disclosure. If he is saying that there will be no problem, he
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
will be able to accept some of the amendments that I shall table later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already referred to the longitudinal study, but presumably names and addresses will be collected in case the form was filled in incorrectly, and for other checking purposes. Will the Minister state unequivocally that he will not allow names and addresses to be used after the checking process is completed? Will he assure us that he will not allow such information to be used for the marketing of junk mail, and for changing credit ratings and increasing insurance premiums—matters to which my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish referred? A clause in the local government legislation enabled poll tax information to be passed on. We want assurances about the marketing of information for junk mail purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Each census form has a number. I have a form in front of me and the census district, enumeration district and form number are prominent on it. Will that number be entered into a computer? If so, there will be a link between the anonymous census data in the, computer, and the name and address on the form, via the number on the form. Will the Minister explain what use is to be made of the computerised census data and the non-cumputerised census form containing the name and address? Reassurances will be meaningless unless the use of the link is fully described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The number will be fed into the computer so that there can be a complete record and an audit trail of the completeness of the information in the computer. However, no record will be made, and therefore no record can be kept, linking the number to the name, and the name will not be fed into the computer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No name and no address?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No name and no address either.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome that assurance. We shall return to these matters in Committee, but it is important that the extent of the linkage should be reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Standing Committee I shall seek a reassurance in respect of the security services. In "Spycatcher" Peter Wright says on page 360 that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the main interest F Branch"—</p></blockquote>
that is, of MI5—
	<br><blockquote><p>"had in the Computer Working Party was to establish widespread computer links, principally with the National Insurance computer in Newcastle".</p></blockquote>
How do we know that the security services will not tap into the census data? Who knows what their idle hands could do with a snapshot of everyone's census data, neatly identified by full name, address and date of birth, so that that can be tied up with other information relating to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are no names or addresses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But they can get access to the names and addresses in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will understand that as the enumeration is done, numbers are assigned to households. The person doing the job will usually assign the numbers as he walks around the area. It does not require great intelligence—especially as the postal code area is known—to relate the numbers to the addresses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. The numbers could be traced back to locales in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0523">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish said that the census information would identify areas with ethnic minorities. The information could show, for example, how many people in a particular area were of Irish extraction. The security services are keen to know about people of Irish extraction, so they could concentrate their efforts on obtaining the numbers from an area code and trying to trace them back to the area in which the census information was collected. That is a problem, and I seek assurances that the security services will not abuse census information. Indeed, I shall table an amendment that would define what should constitute lawful authority. The Minister should give such assurances if he has sufficient security clearance to know about the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Census is an important exercise and it is worthwhile when done properly. However, it is not the only basis by which health centres and nurseries can be provided. Indeed, with the Government's policy of cuts, such services are not being provided in the right areas whether or not census information is used. A Labour Government would do much better in that respect. Information on such services could be provided correctly, if there were greater local democracy, and if councillors or members of local health authorities were consulted. They know where the needy people are in their area. It would be better if there was local input into the decision-making process. I accept that a census can add to information used in local decision making. However, I suspect the main use of the census will be for the allocation of funds at central Government level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Census is an important exercise and the only way in which the demand for public services—other than those that I have mentioned—can be estimated for the coming decade. It requires the trust and confidence of the population. That should be supported by procedures that make the abuse of such trust impossible. I shall table amendments that would improve such procedures. The Government have not gone the right way to encourage trust and confidence in the census. Certainly, the two parliamentary answers to which I have referred are neglectful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.02 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Audrey Wise 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Preston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome the Bill, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) has said, it does not go far enough to address problems that might arise. I agree with the census because it is a valuable tool of social policy. Of course, it does nothing on its own; political will is also needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are historical values in having a census, which no one has mentioned. Census information is a valuable source for people in the future who want to understand the nature of our society. We have a responsibility to provide such a source of historical value. However, the Government have not taken sufficient account of the huge difference that exists between this census and previous ones; that difference is computerisation. It is now possible to match information quickly enough to use it commercially. Information could not be misused in that way because matching was far too cumbersome. Now all kinds of matching operations can be carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We, as Members of Parliament, make some limited use of computers, and have some idea of how a database can be set up and used, but, compared to computer specialists, we are just infants in our understanding of such matters. I have been amazed by sophisticated techniques to cross-match
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
lists. Apparently useless lists of information can be combined by such methods to produce profiles of areas, streets and even individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Computerisation is one new factor that the Government are not considering. The other new factor is the desire to make profit out of everything, even by the selling of public information. Putting those two together creates genuine dangers. I am not worried about the poll tax registration aspect, because poll tax registration officers have access to heaps of other information. So I do not see why they should get excited about census information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned about the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett), particularly about credit ratings and the redlining as it is called, so that a whole district can get a bad credit rating and a bad reputation. I was worried by my hon. Friends reference to the Minister's saying that the banks and building societies will be able to target potential customers more accurately. We are supposed to be providing a social and historical tool, not a commercial tool for banks and building societies. That is taking the census outside its proper function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not happy about the definition of what is an identifiable person because that is being too narrowly thought of. I do not expect individuals to say, "At No. 6 there lives Mrs. Smith," and that she has so many children and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept what is said about professional integrity. I do not see much in that point, nor even much temptation, but I am concerned about the postcode link and the small areas. We have not been given adequate answers. In an area as small as 16 households and 50 people of all ages, a blurring technique could operate to protect the individuals without upsetting the validity of the statistics. If the information is too well blurred it will not tell anyone anything, so why collect it? If it is not properly blurred, it may tell too much to those who have no right to the information. I do not understand why it should be based on postcodes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was made clear when we dealt with the original census order that commercial organisations wanted that form so that they could buy information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Wise</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is quite shocking. We should not have designed the collection of that information—an important social tool—in such a way as to make it useful for commercial organisations. That is wrong. Decisions on how the census information should be collected should have a purely social value. I see no social purpose for which a polling district, at the lowest, would not be adequate. Polling districts are bigger than postcode areas. For most purposes, wards could be adequate. But I may be influenced by the fact that wards in my area are small. While my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) has four wards in his constituency, I have 12, recently reduced from 13. In some areas, wards might be much too large, but polling districts would be suitable. If the purpose is to decide how many nursery schools there should be and where they should be located, or other such matters that could be decided using census information, we do not need to know the information for an area smaller than a polling district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must tell us why that information will be available on a postal code basis. If it were not, we could restrict ourselves to discussing other matters that are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0524">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
worrying us, such as an individual disclosing information about someone else. If the information covers the people living in a street, for example, and that is matched up with other lists, small groups—if not individuals—could be identified. The proposal is not necessary for the legitimate purposes of the census.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept the statement that information disclosure will be kept to the absolute minimum. The phrase "absolute minimum" is in disrepute because of the constant reiteration that bombing in the Gulf will result in the absolute minimum of civilian casualties. I cannot feel the same way about that term as I did a few weeks ago—it does not reassure me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When does the Minister anticipate the Bill reaching its Committee stage? He gave the impression that it could be next week or in a couple of months, implying that there was plenty of time available. I am puzzled by that because the census will be taken shortly. What timetable does the Minister have in mind for the measure to be on the statute book? It will be too late to lock the door after the census is taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be easy to be complacent about the subject by saying that there have been no complaints. I believe that there could be serious breaches that would not give rise to complaints because people would not know about those breaches. People would not be able to match the census with something that puzzled them about information that was available about them. If they cannot make the connection, they will not complain about the census. It would be a mistake to overstate that, as my anxiety about the measure rests mainly on the postal code element and why information covering such small areas can be sold. I am suspicious and am worried that small groups or individuals could be identified in ways that could damage them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for being absent from the Committee earlier. I shall not make a long speech, as some of my remarks may have been covered by other members of the Committee. I hope to have an opportunity to speak later when the Bill proceeds to its Committee stage, as I have added my name to 12 amendments that have been tabled so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This important Bill, which refers to civil liberties, should have been taken on the Floor of the House. Measures involving constitutional issues, such as representation of the people legislation and civil liberties should not be dealt with in a Second Reading Committee, but should be debated on the Floor of the House. There are aspects of this measure that are linked to constitutional issues of the type included in representation of the people legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The census is important for many of the reasons that have been mentioned. Its information can be used for social purposes and it has historical value, but I am worried about some of the items associated with the Bill and other Government legislation which may have an impact on the functioning of a healthy census.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the Government's actions have caused a breach in the supply of information. People now have considerable doubts about supplying information in a census that would not worry them in other circumstances. That is the result of Government policy, especially with regard to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
commercial sale of information relating to electoral registers and the census. The poll tax has had a major impact on people's willingness to provide information and those in desperate circumstances have sought desperate remedies by not registering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that other avenues can be used to provide information. It has been suggested in the House that petitions that are sent to poll tax registrars could be used to check whether people are recorded on poll tax registers. That seems completely out of keeping with the tradition of petitions sent to the House or to the monarch. The names on them cannot be used to apply pressure or exert duress on people. I sought to introduce a Bill relating to petitioners' rights under the ten-minute rule that proposed that petitions correctly addressed and presented to Government agencies should have the same protection afforded to petitions to the House. Unfortunately, many civil liberties and rights have been attacked by the Government and petitions have acquired a greater significance than they had in the past. It is the ancient right of people in our country to address petitions, first, to the monarch and, secondly, to Parliament in an attempt to have their grievances redressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The poll tax has had a devastating impact on the electoral register. I have evidence from statisticians and the House of Commons Library which shows that up to 600,000 people were missing from the electoral register last year. We still await current figures and they may reveal that there has been a pull back in certain areas because some names have been transferred from poll tax registers back to electoral registers. However, the signs are different and information provided in an article that appeared in 	<i>Scotland on Sunday</i> shows that there is great fear about the number of people who are disappearing from the electoral register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For as long as the poll tax continues, there is a need for legal protection of electoral registers to ensure that their information is not handed over to poll tax registrars. Similar protection should be provided in the Bill to keep census information away from those registrars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A leaflet relating to the census points out that information provided in it will be protected and will not be made available to community charge registration officers. That principle must be extended. However, it is difficult to extend it to electoral and poll tax registers as the same individual is often responsible for collecting that information. Because of computers, it is as though different information were contained in different drawers of one person's desk. That does not mean that measures should not be introduced under which the two different types of information are kept separately and people are protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not need to introduce provisions to ensure that certain information is protected. We can overcome the serious problems that could result from the electoral register and the census only by removing the nature of the poll tax legislation and the nature of legislation that allows electoral and census information to be used commercially. The Government should be considering what more can be done to protect the disclosure of important information. Full and valuable census information could be used for a wide range of social purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless the Government considers the matter on a more wider basis, problems will arise. That is another reason why the Bill should have been debated on the Floor of the House. No members of the press are in the Room nor is any
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0525">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
great interest being shown in the issues that we are pursuing. Many implications of the Bill will be unknown to members of the public. If we had debated the Bill on the Floor of the House, it would have given us the opportunity to discuss its provisions more fully and some of our worries may have been taken on board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.21 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By leave of the Committee, the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes) referred to the press. Although there may not be any gentlemen of the press listening to the debate, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that we occasionally discuss such matters in the dead of night when there is an equally empty Press Gallery. Clearly, it is open to him to draw the attention of the press to his remarks in the usual way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have welcomed the basic principles that inform the Bill. I am grateful for the support of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker). Even those who criticised the extent of the Bill and who intend to table amendments to it, have not been at variance with the basic propositions on which it is based, in that, if there is a flaw in the confidentiality provisions covering the census, that flaw should be remedied. Hon. Members have used that argument as a starting point for their remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I endorse what the hon. Member for Perry Barr said about the importance of the principle that the Registrars-General are above politics. They should not be part of the party political debate because they provide the vital basis of information on which a party political debate can take place. The hon. Gentleman stressed that the primary purpose for which census information is collected is to allow the planning of social provision for the future. That is the stuff of party political debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that party political debate to be well informed and to progress the argument, it is just as important that the Opposition have access to reliable information about social patterns as it is for Ministers and local authorities to have access. There should not be a division between the Opposition and the Government about the importance of ensuring that the census is an effective means of gathering information, and that the information produced by the census offices is information on which all sides of the political argument can rely. That is the basis on which all census legislation should proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the discussion that the hon. Member for Perry Barr had with the electoral registration officer and the community charge registration officer in the Birmingham local authority area. Their point that census information has no practical use for checking the electoral register or the community charge register is surely more powerfully made by them than by the hon. Gentleman or me. I rest my case not only on the fact that the Bill should provide a statutory guarantee that information will not pass from one agency to another but on the response of those responsible for completing other registers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the point that was made by the hon. Member for Perry Barr about the importance of accepting the bona fides and the law-abiding commitments of the officers of those agencies, but, even if they were allowed to use the information collected in the census, they would not do so because it would not further their task. The Committee should bear that point in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo the comment of the hon. Member for Perry Barr about the observance of confidentiality by census office
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
employees following the test census in 1989. It is those people whom the Bill is designed to cover. When that test census was taken, the information given to the census officers was covered by the Official Secrets Act 1911. However, it is precisely that sort of operation, in which the repeal of section (2) of the Official Secrets Act 1911 leaves the census officers free of specific confidentiality obligations, that the Bill is designed to reimpose. I am pleased but not surprised that there is no question but that employees of the census office observed the high standards of confidentiality in that test census as has been their track record on census information over a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The points made by the hon. Member for Perry Barr clearly strengthen and reinforce the basis of my arguments—that is, that the Bill is a relatively small but important measure, designed to plug admitted gaps in the confidentiality legislation governing census employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) brought to the Committee the benefit of his experience as a census enumerator. I cannot claim that expertise for myself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: His father was, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry; I missed the point that it is a family tradition. That is expertise indeed for which the Committee was grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised some interesting points. He alleged, without evidence to support his allegation, that public confidence is declining in the confidentiality of information given to census officers. The hon. Gentleman asked about the level of non-compliance in the 1989 census. I am told that, ultimately of about 55 million returns about 6,000 were not received. That led to a total of 700 prosecutions. The scale of non-compliance is tiny, it would be hard to use it as evidence to support that argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that the more crucial question was about accuracy. When an enumerator warns someone who is being a little awkward that he could be prosecuted and that there could be costs to bear and a lot of fuss for the enumerator, he tries to get that person on his side. Any information given is written down, but with a little skill one can normally persuade most people to provide information. However, one difficulty is getting them to do that correctly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who are not happy with what is going on may complete the form with accidental or deliberate mistakes. The quality of the information could thus be devalued. It is difficult for an enumerator to know whether people have bothered to record their children's dates of birth correctly. If public confidence in the census disappears, I fear that people will think that the census does not matter and will fill in the forms to get the enumerator away from their doors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a slightly different point. I am not sure whether it relates specifically to consumer confidence in the census. Clearly, it is always difficult to ensure the accuracy of information recorded in the census. We must live in the real world and recognise that not all of the hundreds of millions of pieces of information that will be gathered during the census will be 100 per cent. accurate. It is the task of the census officers to ensure the highest possible accuracy. That is as much a matter of the training of enumerators and of public education as of public confidence.

The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish said that census offices will raise £29 million by selling their services. That will be good news for them and for me, as I am responsible for negotiating their best bid. I shall use the figure in my discussions with them next year. So far, they have owned up to a significantly lower figure. I am advised that the average income of the census offices from sales to bodies outside the Government during 1992–93 to 1995–96 is expected to be between £1 million and £2 million a year, not £29 million. If the hon. Gentleman has a source for his information, I should be grateful if he would send it to me, as it would greatly strengthen my hand when arguing with the census officers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly no expert in such matters. I merely took the figure from the Government's own booklet, which is supposed to help us to understand the Department's expenditure. The running costs of the census for 1991 will be £63 million, and related receipts will be £25 million. In 1993–94, the gross running costs will be £54 million, and the income will be £29 million. I do not know where the income will come from—I said that it will presumably come from different sources. I should like to know how much the Minister is charging other Government Departments and how much will come from selling information. The Minister says that sales will not generate a large sum. Surely that makes it easier for him to decide not to sell on the basis of 50 households, but to make the number higher. That would not cost the Government much, and it would save us many worries about how the information might be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall write to the hon. Gentleman and clarify the makeup of the £29 million and the £1 million to £2 million. The implication of the figures that are so far available to the Committee is that the balance will be collected from other Government Departments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Wise</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I have that letter too, please?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall copy it for every Committee member. No one should feel excluded.

The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish, referred to the use to which information about small-area statistics is put, and to the sale of information gathered as part of the census process. Several contributions on that theme have been made this morning. The arguments are not directly related to the purpose of the Bill, which is to impose an obligation of confidentiality on employees of the census offices. The range of census information that is already in place governs the type of returns that are envisaged. The census order defined the type of output that will be produced by the census offices as a result of the 1991 census.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of a census is to gather information and make it available in as useful a form as possible to anyone who wishes to use it while safeguarding the confidentiality of the people who provided the information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that it would be impossible within the census legislation to deal with questions of direct mail and redlining of insurance claims and premiums. Those questions are legitimate issues for public debate and they must be debated within the legislation that governs those services. I do not understand how it is possible to argue that a range of information produced by the census offices should be made available to anyone who wishes to cover the cost of
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
producing it except direct mail companies and insurance companies. That proposition need only be stated to be regarded as absurd.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, the Minister accepts that information on small areas used to be available. I understand that it was virtually impossible for any commercial organisation to engage in the matching process that was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Preston (Mrs. Wise), but that was useful for historians and even local councils concerned about their areas. However, it was not easy to translate it into commercial data.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that pressure was applied by commercial organisations which said that if the information was provided in postal code form they could make commercial use of it. I suggest to the Minister that because the Government are prepared to make information available in a form that suits commercial organisations, they are aiding and abetting the red-lining of insurance premiums. I ask the Government to stop aiding and abetting them and to make the information available in slightly larger units. That would still be useful for health authorities and local government, but it would not facilitate activities which greatly aggrieve my constituents. They know that their insurance premiums are higher because they live in an area with a particular postal code rather than in one next to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to correct a misconception that the hon. Gentleman just repeated. In an intervention in the speech made by his hon. Friend the Member for Preston (Mrs. Wise), he suggested that basing the publication of census information on postcode areas and sectors was introduced as a result of representations from commercial interests. That is not correct. One of the major users of census information based on postcode areas is the national health service. In the context of the new health services reforms due shortly, there will be an obligation on the purchasing district health authorities to think about the health needs of all people resident in their districts. One means by which they will identify those needs within a particular locality will be by reference to postcodes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The suggestion that pressure for tabulation by postcode sector comes from commercial interests is factually incorrect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have been pretty generous in allowing a general discussion, but I am sure that the Committee will appreciate that this is a Second Reading Committee debate. All the details that have been mentioned can be raised in the Standing Committee stage. I ask the Committee and the Minister to bear that in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall seek to observe that confinement of the debate to the Bill, Mr. Hughes. Perhaps the best way of doing so is to pass quickly from questions about small area statistics. They have to do with the publication of the results of the census, but not with the nature of the statutory duty of confidentiality which the Bill reinforces in respect of the employees of the census offices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) asked whether the census would collect unnecessary information. He was particularly concerned about details surrounding dates of birth which he thought could lead to the tracing of personally sensitive information. The precise purpose of section 8(2) of the Census Act 1920, as reinforced by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0527">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
Bill, is to ensure that if such a process were possible it would not be allowed to take place. The employees of the census offices are already under an obligation, which is reinforced by the Bill, not to make available personally sensitive information of that kind, however it is derived. The hon. Gentleman suggested that that would lead to a link with the community charge registration process. I have already dealth with that and I do not believe that it is a substantial fear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Preston drew attention to a matter that I, as an amateur historian, consider important—the nature and value of the census as a historical source. I was glad that someone made that point. The hon. Lady then suggested that our aim was to make a profit out of everything. She was worried about statistics for profit. I have already referred to the scale of earnings that the census officers envisage from the sale of that information to all organisations, commercial and non-commercial, outside the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guideline should be that the census offices should produce information in a form that maximises user value. That is what they have tried to do. The information published on postcode sector, which is the smallest routine area of survey that will be published as a result of the census, is intended to ensure that information collected by the census is presented in a form that maximises user value in both the public and the private sector. I do not apologise for the proposition that if such information is collected, it will be a valuable resource to both the public and the private sector including, as the hon. Lady rightly says, historians.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Wise</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Historians are hardly commercial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, but most of them are in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the timetable for the Standing Committee, it is not for me to determine the procedures of the House, but I hope that we shall be able to proceed on a standard timetable for the selection of a Committee and the completion of the Committee stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East was worried that linkages with the census and other sources of information—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister mean that the Committee will be selected next week and meet the week after, or that selection will take place in a fortnight?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That has nothing to do with the Committee and can be discussed elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dorrell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am gratefull to you, Mr. Hughes, because that is a question that I feel ill-qualified to answer, even if it were to do with the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East was worried about linkages between the electoral registration officer and the community charge registration officer. I have already dealt with that. He was also worried about linkages from petitions in the House and petitions to the Crown. This is the first time that I have heard that argument. Happily, petitions to the Crown are not the responsibility of the Health Ministers, nor are petitions to the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East, and to all the anxieties about cross-linkages and the availability of information from the census offices is that the Bill is designed to reinforce the proposition which we all accept as correct—that the employees of the census offices are employed to collect personally sensitive information on a compulsory basis, and that those who provide that information on a compulsory basis are entitled to expect that the duty of confidentiality that exists on census office employees is absolute and will be observed. The Bill makes it absolute, and the record of the census offices should give us all confidence that the legal obligations reinforced by the Bill will be observed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
