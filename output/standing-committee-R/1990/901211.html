<div class='page-header'><h1>OVERSEA SUPERANNUATION BILL</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Overseas Development (Mrs. Lynda Chalker)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee recommends that the Oversea Superannuation Bill ought to be read a Second time.</p></blockquote>
Hon. Members may be unaware that the Overseas Development Administration has an important responsibility for the pension rights of many thousands of officers and their dependants who served in the former colonies and in the Asian sub-continent. Those men and women were the predecessors of the technical assistance officers whom the ODA now appoints to the service of overseas Governments. Virtually all of the pension schemes and ordinances were desgined specifically to suit the needs of individual territories. The funds are now administered by Her Majesty's Government through the Overseas Pensions Act 1973.<br><br>
Certain research and scientific officers who worked in the colonies under the auspices of the Colonial Secretary were not employed on the permanent establishments of the territories and did not, therefore, benefit from the funds and schemes. The oversea superannuation scheme was set up in 1951 under its original name, the colonial superannuation scheme, to cater for those officers. The OSS has always been a small scheme—at most it has had 225 members. The scheme was closed to new members as long ago as 1961 and there are no active contributors. At present it has 134 officer pensions and 17 dependants' awards. All but five of those pensioners have an entitlement to supplements payable under the United Kingdom Pensions (Increase) Acts.<br><br>
Administrative costs continue to constitute a substantial burden on the fund's finances. In finalisation of our wider policy on colonial pension funds, we propose to convert the fund to a pay-as-you-go system. Under this arrangement the assets of the fund are made over to the Exchequer, in exchange for an undertaking to pay the pensions out of current revenue. The proposal has been approved by the OSS Advisory Board and the scheme's members have been consulted. All the scheme's members will benefit from having their pension guaranteed by the Exchequer. The five members not at present entitled to UK pension increases will in future receive comparable supplements to their basic pensions. That is an improvement for them.<br><br>
In order to proceed with eventual conversion to the pay-as-you-go system, we need to bring the OSS within the scope of the Overseas Pensions Act 1973. The OSS is now the only pension fund under our jurisdiction which does not fall within the remit of that Act. The Bill, when it becomes law, will remove that anomaly. Conversion will be cost neutral for the Exchequer and there are no manpower implications for the public service. This is an enabling, tidying-up, sorting-out, little Bill and hope that the Committee will give it a fair wind.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
<p>10.33 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Swansea, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that clear explanation of this enabling and tidying Bill, which affects the interests of only a relatively small number of contributors. Nevertheless, they are an important group. Those who served this country abroad prior to 1961 do not benefit from subsequent schemes and need to have their pensions protected.<br><br>
I assume that there is no question of funding being inadequate for benefits. Given the figures in the Bill, funds are relatively healthy in terms of the calls upon them. The real motive behind the Bill must be administrative and technical, rather than to provide specific benefits that will go to the small number of contributors and their dependants. Perhaps the Minister will tell us in simple terms how she would explain to existing contributors that they are better off as a result of the Bill.<br><br>
I notice that the pensions will be brought into line with existing schemes. Can we assume that those people who have contributed up to 1961 will be no worse off as a result of this change than people in schemes which have been effected since then?<br><br>
I also note that the provisions will not come into force until two months after the Bill has received Royal Assent. That is unusual. Is that simply for administrative convenience or is there a special reason for that time limit?</span></p>
<p>10.36 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Peter Emery <span class='memberconstituency'>(Honiton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask my right hon. Friend the Minister one question, to which, I am afraid, I know the answer? Many people have worked in similar occupations in southern Rhodesia and their pensions are held by the southern Rhodesian Government. Their pensions are blocked, and paid only in southern Rhodesian currency, which is particularly hard for them. Will they be included in the Bill? If not, will the Government do something to help those people who were Crown servants as such and who are badly hit financially because they live in this country and their pensions are paid in Rhodesian currency, not sterling?</span></p>
<p>10.37 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Chalker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to take the question from my hon. Friend the Minister for Honiton (Sir Peter Emery) first. The pensioners about whom he is so concerned are also my concern because I have constituents in that position. They will not be affected by the Bill. We have much sympathy with those past southern Rhodesian pensioners—Zimbabwean pensioners—but their pensions were granted and contributed to very clearly within the law of the Government of Zimbabwe.<br><br>
I have taken up a number of cases with the President and other members of the Government of Zimbabwe, asking them to free assets and get pensions paid properly. I shall continue to do so, but I cannot see any prospect of our Treasury assuming responsibility for something that lies wholly within the responsibility of the Government of Zimbabwe—much as I should like to help the individuals concerned. I know their plight well.<br><br>
I turn now to the question from the hon. Member for Swansea, East (Mr. Anderson). It is important for people not to be worse off. I can give him an assurance that the Bill will make people no worse off. Indeed, as I intimated, the five dependants already mentioned will be better off.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0540">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
I know that questions arise about past schemes. I know from my days dealing with pensions, how often we said that if we were setting up a scheme, we would do it differently. However, a scheme that has made no bad losses, thank goodness, but not much profit, might be well left alone. Yet when we consider the scheme by today's standards it is clear that it was not as well conceived as other pension schemes in 1951, subsequent schemes and the Overseas Pensions Act 1973. It has been adequately managed by the Crown Agents Asset Management, but it is the way in which the scheme was set up that causes us to believe that it will be better to adopt the pay-as-you-go principle.<br><br>
The levels of pensions are generated by the fund as it stands, but the increases have been less than the United Kingdom pension increases and we have always had to top them up. We want to avoid that extra administrative cost because administrative costs are about 25 per cent. of the total pension bill. We want to get rid of that administrative burden and to concentrate resources on pensions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister confirm that none of the administrative costs, which she says now are 25 per cent. of the total, will, as a result of this change and the move of funds into the Consolidated Fund, fall on the existing beneficiaries?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Chalker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Gentleman that assurance. After conversion under the 1973 Act all the risk inherent in any fund is removed and that burden disappears. In future, pensioners will receive UK index-linked pensions.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Swansea, East, asked about the Bill's timing. I am told that two months is the standard time for bringing in pensions legislation following Royal Assent. One must have a very special reason for doing so earlier, given that pensioners go on being paid under existing law until such time as they are covered by the 1973 Act. There is no reason for making the time limit earlier as this is a standard pensions matter.<br><br>
I hope that I have answered every question satisfactorily and that the Committee will now approve the measure.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee recommends that the Oversea Superannuation Bill ought to be read a Second time.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Committee rose at nineteen minutes to Eleven o'clock.</i></p>
