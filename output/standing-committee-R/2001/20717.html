	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and the Regions (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> May I say what a pleasure it is to speak in the Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. O'Brien. I am pleased to make a short statement about the Government's new regional agenda and answer questions about the proposals in the White Paper, "Your Region, Your Choice: Revitalising the English Regions", which we published in May.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government believe that the proposals offer the English regions a great opportunity. The White Paper sets out our plans to decentralise power, strengthen regional policy, and enable elected regional assemblies to be established in regions that want them. They form part of our wider programme of constitutional reform and build on the progress that we have already made in decentralising power and bringing decision making closer to those whom it affects. It also builds on the progress that we have made in devolving power to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and in giving London a democratically elected, strategic authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper forms part of our overall approach to modernising governance in this country. The message running through it is that we need to ensure that functions are carried out at the right level of government, whether national, regional or local. "Your Region, Your Choice" builds on what is already in place in the English regions. As hon. Members know, we created the regional development agencies to help revitalise the regions, recognising the importance of effective regional action to enhance competitiveness, improve economic performance, and further regeneration. We encouraged the creation of voluntary regional chambers—assemblies, as they are now generally known—to scrutinise the work of the RDAs and to achieve better co-ordinated regional planning. We have strengthened Government offices to help to deliver better results by working in a more integrated way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper contains several proposals to strengthen the arrangements. It seeks to build on the role of the assemblies to scrutinise the role of the RDAs and to work with Government offices and other Government-funded bodies in the region to join up work on regional initiatives. We believe that the closer involvement of the assemblies will increase regional accountability. Taking a lead from our planning Green Paper, we also intend the assemblies to become regional planning bodies from April 2003. The White Paper makes it clear that where assemblies work effectively, they have a key role in expressing the interests and needs of a region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
The White Paper also acknowledges progress in drawing regional strategies together and proposes that the assemblies develop that further. The Government will support that work. For example, when we develop detailed proposals on regional spatial strategies, we will consider whether more could be done to integrate them with other regional strategies. However, the assemblies will work closely with Government offices, other Government-funded bodies in the region and other regional partners to decide how to take that forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will delegate more responsibilities to the Government offices and will shift the focus from Whitehall to the regions. Those extra responsibilities, including the responsibility for crime reduction and drugs, community cohesion and public health, will strengthen regional decision making and better reflect regional priorities. The Government offices also have a natural role to play in bringing together public sector organisations that work at a regional level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We realise that these developments will be sufficient for some regions in the short term at least. However, some regions will not be satisfied with that, and without a direct democratic mandate, there will always be a limit to what can be devolved to the bodies that currently work in the regions. That is why the White Paper offers the opportunity for an elected assembly in any region that chooses this option. An elected assembly will give a region a real political voice and people more say about the issues that affect their region. It can make government more effective and efficient, developing tailored regional solutions to regional problems. It can also enable regions to build on their unique strengths, improve economic performance and quality of life, and help build and reinforce regional self-confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper is about choice. No region will be forced to have an assembly and people will have to vote 'Yes' in a referendum before an assembly is put in place. We recognise that interest in elected regional assemblies varies throughout England, so we will not require referendums to be held in all English regions outside London at the same time. Instead, we will hold a referendum in a region when we consider that there is sufficient public interest in holding one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. O'Brien.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will gauge interest by taking into account the views of members of the public and local authorities and other key stakeholders in the region. We plan to say more about the specific way in which we will assess public interest in the next few weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In deciding the specific powers and responsibilities for elected regional assemblies, we have been conscious of the need to define unambiguously the issues that are best dealt with at a regional level. Those are the specific functions that can and should be devolved by central Government and must be handled on a wider scale than those appropriate to local
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0612">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
authorities. Local authorities remain the bodies best placed to deliver services locally and we do not propose that elected regional assemblies will take such powers away from local government. Equally, issues such as economic development, transport planning and spatial planning should be approached on a wider basis than local authority boundaries, which is why elected regional assemblies can make a difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Each elected regional assembly will develop a strategic vision for improving the quality of life in its region and set out its priorities through a range of regional strategies. Those strategies will cover important issues such as economic development and regeneration, skills and employment, housing, transport, spatial planning, health improvement and culture. The assemblies will be tasked with ensuring that all strategies fit together effectively to provide a coherent approach to the region's development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Assemblies will have a range of powers to deliver the strategies, including financial resources for economic development, housing, tourism, arts and sport. They will also be responsible for the regional development agencies, appointing the board and approving the regional economic strategy. They will have the flexibility to allocate spending according to regional priorities, which offers the prospect of tailored regional solutions to regional problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals are not about taking powers away from local government. Elected assemblies will be taking their powers from central Government and their agencies, not from local authorities. Elected regional assemblies will be responsible for strategic decisions and priorities that affect their region. Local authorities will continue to focus on local service delivery and community leadership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government want elected regional assemblies to be democratic and inclusive. We are aware that if assemblies do nothing else but provide more jobs for the boys, they will fail. Assemblies must therefore not add bureaucracy, but will instead be small and streamlined, with between 25 and 35 members. As such, they will follow the model of the Greater London Authority, which has shown that a body dealing with strategic responsibilities can operate with much fewer members than the traditional local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, keeping the size of the strategic regional assembly small brings other advantages, not least in avoiding potential confusion about the roles of elected assembly members, local councillors and local Members of Parliament. Elected regional assemblies will have a leader and cabinet of up to six members chosen by and fully accountable to the assembly. The cabinet will develop policies and, after gaining full approval from the assembly, implement them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To promote a real improvement in regional decision making, elected regional assemblies will need to ensure they harness the experience, expertise and commitment of others in the region. One of the most pleasing aspects of the advent of regional assemblies has been the involvement of stakeholders throughout. There have inevitably been hiccups. Business, the voluntary
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
sector and trade unions will not always agree, both with each other and local authority representatives, but the harnessing of the wide range of experience and expertise has undoubtedly been a good thing. We want and expect to see elected assemblies making full use of all stakeholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How do we do that without undermining the democratic legitimacy of the elected members? The White Paper outlines a number of options. For example, people with specific expertise could be co-opted to scrutiny or policy development committees, or as policy advisors on specific topics. There could be consultative forums or sounding boards of stakeholder representatives. The White Paper invites views on how the Government should set out the involvement of key stakeholders, and we shall certainly pay heed to the views expressed in response to the White Paper and to those expressed today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposals for elected regional assemblies are about ensuring that decision making is simpler and more efficient. By joining up regional strategies, improving co-ordination and providing stronger scrutiny, elected regional assemblies should reduce bureaucracy, not add to it. However, in areas that currently have a county council and a district council, a regional assembly would add a third tier of elected government below the national level. That would add complexity to the government structure, and moving to a unitary local government structure in such regions would simplify relationships for local authorities and regional assemblies as well as making it clearer to the public who did what.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any region where we decide that a referendum on elected assemblies should go ahead, we shall ask the Boundary Committee to undertake a review of local government structures and to recommend the most effective wholly unitary structure. Concerns have been raised about the distraction that any review and subsequent local government reorganisation will cause and it would be unrealistic to say that no distraction will occur in regions in which a review takes place. However, we are keen to keep such distractions to a minimum and to ensure that local government continues to focus on service delivery and on our modernisation agenda. That is why reviews will take place only in regions that want to hold a referendum on having an elected regional assembly and why we propose that any review will exclude existing unitary authorities. Such authorities serve more than half the population of England, and they serve rather more of the population in those regions that have expressed the greatest interest to date in moving to an elected regional assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will, of course, be no change in the responsibilities that Parliament and central Government take for United Kingdom-wide matters. Many policy areas of England-wide importance, such as the national health service and schools, will remain on an England-wide basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Committee will continue to play a role. It provides a forum for hon. Members to debate English regional issues and the Government welcome its contribution. I expect it to have a continuing role in considering and debating the Government's policy up
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0613">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
to and beyond the creation of the first elected regional assemblies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The timetable for moving towards an elected regional assembly will vary from region to region, and some may choose not to go down that route for many years. When parliamentary time allows, we intend to introduce a Bill to provide for referendums and associated local government reviews, with the aim of enabling the first referendum to be held during this Parliament. Once at least one region has voted for an elected assembly, we intend to introduce a further Bill to allow assemblies to be set up. Elections for assemblies in regions where there has been a yes vote in a referendum would be held within months of the Bill becoming law. In practice, that should allow the first regional assembly to be up and running early in the next Parliament. We are considering the process by which we shall choose which regions will have a referendum and we will make an announcement in the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's new regional agenda is a real and exciting opportunity to improve economic performance and revitalise democracy throughout England. We firmly believe that elected regional assemblies can and will have a real impact on a region's prosperity. An assembly will have the responsibilities, powers and funding to develop and implement a cohesive and strategic vision to improve economic prosperity and quality of life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regional governance White Paper forms a crucial part of our constitutional reform programme to modernise government, decentralise power and bring decision making closer to those it affects. Our proposals will make government in England more accountable, more efficient and more effective. Ultimately, they will lead to a more prosperous and inclusive society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We shall have questions until 6 o'clock and debate matters until 7.30 pm. If questions and answers are brief, I am sure that everyone will get in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cotswold)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I congratulate the Minister; this is the first opportunity that we have had to face each other across the Committee. I also want to say what a privilege it is to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. O'Brien.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have questions for the Minister on three matters in the light of his clear statement. First, will he give us a little more guidance on the timetable for a referendum? If, as he said, he intends to make an announcement shortly, he must have consulted already. Will he give us an idea of the likely outcomes of those consultations? How quickly would he expect the boundary commission to draw up its proposals? Will the normal democratic hearings apply in the drawing up of those proposals for unitary authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, will the Minister say something about the costs of setting up the regional assemblies? We know from the Green Paper that the administrative cost will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
be £25 million for each, which is £200 million for the eight. Will he comment on the capital costs of abolishing county and district councils and of establishing new buildings in the regions and probably in Brussels and elsewhere?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, will the Minister talk about how the country will be managed? If some areas vote for regional assemblies and some do not, we will have a pretty good dog's breakfast. How will regions connect with each other? Several issues such as transport will cross from one region to another, so what mechanism will be used between a region with a regional assembly and one without?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the Minister responds, I advise that each hon. Member ask up to two short questions. If we have time, they can ask questions a second time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I return the compliment to the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) by congratulating him on his appointment to his position on the Front Bench. I look forward to many debates with him on this and related matters in the months ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our paper will set out our thoughts on how we might gauge interest in holding referendums in each region. It will be a consultative paper in itself and will invite comments. In the month since the publication of the White Paper, I have spoken to several meetings in the regions and invited comments from the audiences and we will incorporate some of the suggestions made in our proposals. The ideas are developing and there will be a full opportunity for comment on the proposals that we publish later in the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Boundary Committee will decide how it conducts its affairs. It is an independent body and we fully intend its processes to continue independently. We will give it guidance on the broad parameters, including on the fact that the measures should lead to a wholly unitary structure. However, it will be for the committee to decide how it proceeds. I am advised that up to a year should suffice, allowing for normal consultation, but we will obviously take further advice from the Electoral Commission and the Boundary Committee in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost of local government reorganisation involved in setting up regional assemblies will vary hugely from region to region, as the hon. Gentleman will recognise. In the northern part of the country, there is already a predominantly unitary structure for local government. In Yorkshire and Humberside, 89 per cent. of the population already live in unitary authorities. Therefore, the costs of reorganisation in such a region are likely to be extremely different from those in, say, the south-west. Many members of the Committee are familiar with the south-west and they will know that the structure of local government there predominantly has two tiers. I cannot give an overall estimate and it would be misleading to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to ensure that any change is handled as cost-effectively as possible. We do not wish to repeat the experiences of the early 1990s, when the processes of the Banham committee were long and tortuous, and managed to waste a great deal of time and energy in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0614">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
fruitless recommendations that never came into effect. We want the matter to be handled in a proper and cost-effective way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as buildings are concerned, it will be for individual regions to decide whether they need new premises in addition to existing premises that might already be available. That will be a matter for them to decide. We certainly do not envisage this as an opportunity for large-scale construction of grand new buildings. As I said, we expect elected regional assemblies to be small, lean bodies and we want them to be cost-effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised the question of arrangements for representation in Europe and many regions already have such representation. I expect them to continue with that. Whether they would need additional representation in Brussels or elsewhere would depend on whether they considered their current arrangements to be adequate. However, I do not foresee substantial additional costs arising in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. Gentleman mentioned connections between regions that choose to have elected regional assemblies and those that do not. That is where the proposals in the White Paper for strengthening regional co-ordination and the work of the Government offices for the regions will come into play. The White Paper has proposals for those regions that intend to stay as they are—without elected regional assemblies—as well as those that choose to have them. We do not wish to put either category of region at a disadvantage and we do not want to reduce effective communication between regions, because many issues inevitably cut across regional boundaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wyatt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems incredible, when this is such an important issue, that we should have been given only 48 hours' notice of this debate. Will the Minister explain why the debate was so suddenly added to the Order Paper two days ago?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If universities are going to be our main economic driver, where will they be in the regional assemblies? Will we involve international, national and local universities? We need some understanding of the role of the university in a regional assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, can the regional boundaries be changed? I belong to the Thames gateway region, which is to the north and south of the Thames. It is a much more powerful entity and it would be the most important agency outside of London. The South-East Development Agency means nothing to anybody because its area runs from Milton Keynes to Margate and down to Bournemouth. Is that boundary carved in stone?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a number of interesting contributions. The timing of this debate was not of my making. However, I was more than happy to seize the opportunity for a debate on the White Paper and I can only apologise for the fact that other hon. Members were told of the debate at such short notice. It seemed better to have a debate than not to have one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
We want universities to continue to make an important contribution to the economic activity of their region, as already happens. However, it is a slight overstatement to say that they are the main driver for economic development in the regions. Some of them are important centres of clusters of activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wyatt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Such as Stanford or Harvard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may cite American examples, but if he claims that Oxford university is the main driver for the south-east economy, he undermines his subsequent point that different parts of the south-east region do not have very much in common. He rightly pointed out the difference between the Thames gateway and Milton Keynes. That point applies very much and it would be inappropriate to consider Oxford university as the main economic driver for the Thames gateway area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I envisage an important role for economic contributions from universities and higher and further education institutes. That will be part of the overall framework. How that happens will depend on the arrangements that are put in place wherever an elected regional assembly is brought into being, and it will be up to the assembly to decide how it wishes to build relationships with the universities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am more than happy to confirm my hon. Friend's observations about the importance of the Thames gateway planning structure, which has enabled a more coherent approach to be adopted towards the economic development of that hugely important area. The gateway crosses three separate regions—London, the eastern region and the south-east—and it provides exactly the sort of cross-regional co-ordination that the hon. Member for Cotswold highlighted. Those sorts of arrangements will be necessary whatever the regional structure, because there will always be areas of economic development that cross existing boundaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Andrew George 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(St. Ives)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Liberal Democrats welcome the fact that the Government are prepared to tackle this unfinished business, but will the Minister take advantage of the relative obscurity of this Committee to be a little more candid about what has been going on behind the scenes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The contradiction evident in annex E of the White Paper and the hyperbole in its opening chapters clearly demonstrate that the Government favour an asymmetric model, with varying sizes and so on. However, in the meat of the document we find a clearly symmetric and largely control-freak version of devolution. I would be glad to hear the Minister's comments on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will be the future of quangos and Government offices? It is clear that many people will be disappointed that this devolution is very timid, with scrutiny powers only over existing quangos and Government offices. Many people will wonder whether it is worth breaking into a sweat about it. Will the Minister be candid also about the future of quangos and Government offices? Will they be retained, or do the Government have other plans for them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I shall disappoint the hon. Gentleman if he thought that I would rise to the bait of using the "obscurity" of this Committee to be more candid. Perhaps he has an underdeveloped sense of the significance of ministerial statements in any location, however obscure they may seem to be. Notwithstanding that, I tried to be fairly candid in my opening remarks and I shall try to be as open as I can in answering questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman thought that annex E indicated a rather consistent pattern of regional devolution in other countries, but the evidence is that asymmetric patterns do exist in other countries. Taking Spain at random, the smallest region of Navarra consists of a mere 540,000 people; the largest region of Andalousia has 7.3 million people. The proposals for the United Kingdom have a much smaller difference—about 7.5 million for the largest and 2.5 million for the smallest. There will be variations, but they will not be as wide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the hon. Gentleman's second point, the Spanish arrangements involve considerable variation in the degree of autonomy enjoyed by different regions. For example, the Basque province and Catalonia have very extensive devolved powers. Other regions in Spain have substantially fewer devolved powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Steen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Totnes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has not done them much good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that it has not done them much good—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We ought to stick to the rule and have no banter. The Minister is answering questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I bow to your wise judgment, Mr. O'Brien. I have no doubt that the hon. Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen) will return to that matter and I will happily answer his question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are significant variations in Europe, and we allow for variations and asymmetric options in England. The situation is asymmetrical in that the extent of devolution will vary between Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the English regions, and the option is asymmetrical in that there can be elected regional assemblies in some English regions and not in others. There is a parallel with what applies elsewhere and I do not think that we are doing anything inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the question about whether it was all worth the effort, I must point out to the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George) that the Liberal Democrats have for a long time been advocates of regional devolution. My discussions with members of his party and consultations that I have held throughout the country have shown that, even if people are not in complete agreement with all our proposals, they generally welcome them, as his opening remarks bore out. I am sure that we shall have a productive debate in the next year or so about the extent of devolved powers and how they might change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the future of Government offices and quangos. Implicit in our White Paper is the fact that Government offices will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
have increased powers and will play a continuing and significant role. In London, even after the creation of the Greater London Authority, the Government office continues to have a role. Its role has changed now that there is an elected body within the quasi-region—this city—but it still exists. Government offices will continue to exist in all regions, even in those that have elected regional assemblies. The powers will vary, which is another element of the asymmetry to which I referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for quangos, they are bodies that everyone loathes when out of government but finds extraordinarily useful when in power. That pattern has been repeated for many years. Since I have been a Member of the House, or even since I began to follow politics, I have read denunciations of quangos from people who have gone on, when in government, to create large numbers of them. We are not in the business of creating large numbers of quangos, but we recognise a need for bodies that are independent of Government to perform certain functions. Most people would accept that bodies such as the Environment Agency are appropriately designed to meet particular needs that are not best discharged by Government. However, a framework should exist for democratic accountability whenever possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The elected regional assembly provides an opportunity to introduce such democratic accountability to cover functions that are presently discharged by quangos, which do not have a line of regional accountability. For example, the Housing Corporation dispenses large sums in all regions; it is accountable to Ministers and through them to Parliament, but it has no framework for regional accountability. There are proposals that it will have one, however—we propose to change the lines of accountability. Anyone who suggested that all quangos should be abolished, however, would be somewhat naive. That is not our intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Candy Atherton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falmouth and Camborne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two questions. First, if the Government felt that a referendum were appropriate, what mechanism would be used for that? At what point do the Government think that a call will come—through local authorities or the media, or through popular expression from the wider region? Secondly, what will be the optimum size of unitaries in the new structures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend asks two important questions. In the relatively near future, we shall consult further the mechanism for deciding where referendums will be held. We have been taking soundings and will set out our proposals in the next month or so, and we shall invite comments on them before decisions are taken. We shall listen to the views of local authorities, existing assemblies and other bodies established in the regions, including representatives from business, trade unions, the voluntary sector, social and economic partners and members of the public. Precisely how best that can be achieved will be the subject of further consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On my hon. Friend's second point, which I have completely forgotten—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0616">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Atherton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The size of unitary authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting issue because we have made it clear that it will be up to the Boundary Committee to decide on the best wholly unitary structure in any particular area. As I have said several times since the White Paper was published, we do not want to set limits to that. We believe that, in some areas, a wholly unitary structure based on existing counties might be an appropriate solution. Certainly, several people in Cornwall have expressed a view that that might be a good solution and one that would contribute towards the aspirations of the people of Cornwall for more self-governance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that others take a different view and believe that division into several unitary authorities, larger than the existing districts but smaller than existing counties, might be a preferable option. That will be for the Boundary Committee to decide. Obviously, there are some limits. It would be inappropriate to set up a unitary authority that was so small that it was incapable of discharging its functions. Responsibilities for education and social services cannot be discharged well by a very small authority. It will be necessary to take heed of that when we give guidance to the Boundary Committee, but I am keen that we should not be unduly prescriptive, because we want to take account of the different circumstances in various areas and do not want to preclude options such as a wholly unitary structure based on existing counties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Lansley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to take the Minister on to the subject of finance and ask him how the regional assembly is to spend its money. If I understood him correctly, he said that the regional assembly would be able to move money in a single block budget according to regional priorities. Two questions arise from that. First, in so far as that money is substantially the same money that will be made available to the regional development agency, as part of its single pot, from April 2003, is the Minister proposing that the regional assembly should be able to override the regional development agency's choices about how it allocates money from that single pot? In that case, the single pot would no longer be the regional development agency's money but that of the regional assembly. Secondly, the table on page 45 of the White Paper gives an example of the budget for the north-east. It includes in the budget that is the responsibility of the assembly £89 million of European programmes money. Is the Minister suggesting that the regional assembly would be able to reallocate those European resources to any other purpose that is specifically provided for under European programmes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks some searching questions, which raise some pertinent issues. As he will appreciate, it is important to achieve a balance between giving elected regional assemblies flexibility to use their finances as they think most effective, while ensuring that particular channels of finance are not diverted from the purposes for which they are intended. There is a tension between those aims. We plan to square the circle by using a framework that allocates a block grant to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
regional assembly, so that it has some discretion, but also ensures that there are a few agreed outcomes, which would be negotiated between the regional assembly and central Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, the RDA will continue to be a business-led body, which will make its own proposals, and there will be discussion with the Secretary of State about implementation of the business plan for the region. The region will not have full discretion to shift resources between different headings. However, at the margins there will be significant flexibility. That is right; we want to extend to devolved bodies, whether local government or regional, the opportunity and freedom to determine their budgets in the best way. We have made it clear that it is our intention that there will not be a significant difference in the funding for those regions that have regional assemblies and those that do not. A reward grant will be implicit in the public service agreement so, to that extent, additional finance will be available to regional assemblies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The response of local authority representatives to the availability of reward grant in relation to local PSAs has been extremely positive—they have welcomed them. We are trying to tread a clear line between conflicting pressures; ensuring that there is flexibility to spend and that sums allocated for particular purposes are not unduly diverted, while giving incentives to elected regional assemblies to make the best use of their resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lawrie Quinn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Scarborough and Whitby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In welcoming the Minister's statement and the White Paper, I speak for the vast majority of people in one of the most peripheral parts of England, the Yorkshire coast, who have felt somewhat out of it with regard to the allocation of resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Minister about what appears on pages 68 and 69 of the White Paper regarding process. The current regional assembly for Yorkshire and the Humber has taken some successful road shows into the community and they have attracted a lot of attention and debate. Can the Minister say how far that type of enhancement to the consultation process will be taken, not only in response to the White Paper, but also in regard to the soundings that he mentioned?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the chart on page 68 details the various procedures towards establishing an elected regional assembly. Can the Minister put a time scale to that, in order to give the Committee some idea about how he would fulfil his objective of delivery of a regional assembly within the term of this Parliament?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for those questions. Before I answer, I must apologise to the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) for my failure to respond to his second question about European money and to add a brief comment on that. Those funds are earmarked for specific purposes and it will be necessary for the elected regional assembly to ensure that they are used for those purposes. That reinforces my point about the need to get the correct balance between earmarking funds and allowing flexibility.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
On the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Lawrie Quinn) about the timetable and the process, we are dependent on the Queen's Speech. If we are given clearance to proceed with legislation, a Bill will be introduced in the next Parliament—the earliest that it could be introduced. We should then be in a position to consider by this time next year whether an appetite for elected regional assemblies exists in individual regions, assuming the passage of legislation. Beyond that, there is a Boundary Committee examination of the structure of local government in the region. As I told the hon. Member for Cotswold, that might take up to a year, so we are talking about a relatively long period of time. This will not happen quickly, although I suspect that once the process begins, people in each region will see things progressing and become involved in other activities related to the promotion of the concept of elected regional assemblies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said in my response to an earlier question, we have been sounding out opinion informally. On Friday, I spoke at a meeting in the west midlands that was held by the regional assembly. There was considerable representation from the business community, the voluntary sector and local government. I was impressed by the degree of unanimity across the sectors and political parties. There was some disagreement, but people in that region clearly want to explore the potential benefits for the west midlands. The more that people read the prospectus and consider the possibility of securing real opportunities for enhancing the economic competitiveness of their region and helping to achieve long-held regional objectives, the more the enthusiasm that I detected in Birmingham on Friday will be seen elsewhere. As I said, we will consult later in the summer on how we intend to take the soundings, and we certainly welcome responses from all those with an interest in these issues. People should not feel hesitant about giving us their views before the Bill is published. As I said, we will take full heed of what is said this afternoon when we consider how we present our proposals for taking soundings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Norman Lamb 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Norfolk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives, I welcome the start of a debate on the creation of a regional tier of government. My concern is that if that is done in the wrong way and is not effective in decentralising power, it will create a head of steam against the whole concept of decentralisation. With reference to some of the examples in annexe E, is it not self-evident that the proposals are much more timid than those of many other countries in Europe? In his reply to the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire, the Minister talked about allowing elected regional assemblies discretion at the margins. However, the proposals are very timid and will not amount to a real decentralisation compared with the decentralisation of power to Scotland and Wales. Power will continue to reside at the centre, especially as tax raising is still focused much more at the centre than in any other European country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
If the process of introducing unitary authorities is tied to reform of local government, will that not create the opportunity for opponents of the whole concept of decentralisation of power to build up a head of steam for preserving the shire counties, and make it much more difficult to set up regional assemblies throughout the country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may distil the hon. Gentleman's questions, they boil down to a fear that our proposals will encourage the opponents of regional devolution, as they will appear to be too timid or the processes will appear to allow too many objections. I take the opposite view. We start from the recognition that the appetite for regional devolution varies from region to region in England. We do not believe that it is right to impose something on a region that is not wanted. The hon. Gentleman may think that that is timid, but I believe that it is pragmatic and sensible, and that the cause of regional devolution will be damaged much more by proposing a wholesale devolution to regions where there no appetite for it. Proceeding pragmatically where there is interest is a much more sensible, and British, way of doing things, than imposing—continental style—some Napoleonic blueprint on every region irrespective of its wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree, equally, that the proposals are timid. A Government who have extended devolved power to Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London have considerable claim to bravery in their policy on regional devolution, of which the proposals are a further step. The measures are well designed to extend opportunities for devolved power, while recognising that people want some issues to be handled nationally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The country is relatively small and people still look to this place and to Ministers, whichever party is in government, to deliver on certain objectives. I receive an extraordinary number of letters from people who want me to deal with small-scale matters that are usually dealt with by local government. Letters to Ministers are an indication of the aspirations of people in this country for responses from Westminster. We seek a balance between the natural concern that Westminster should continue to have a significant role in many areas of policy, and devolution on matters that are best dealt with at a regional level. That is why we are not proposing the wholesale devolution of powers that are devolved in a more federal country. Many European countries have a federal constitution, but we do not. We still have a unitary Government, but we are devolving power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our pragmatic and sensible approach will do more to defuse opposition and to disarm opponents of devolution than an alternative approach, which, frankly, would frighten many people and might result in the defeat of the whole agenda of regional devolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Louise Ellman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, Riverside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like the Minister clarify his statement that all regional assemblies will become regional planning bodies. What powers will they have and will unelected people on the assemblies be able to vote on planning? I would also like him to clarify his comment on the national health service, which he stated would remain a national service. Does that mean that he is ignoring the regional
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0618">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
aspects and interests in the NHS, especially as the White Paper makes specific reference to the importance of public health and the role of the director of public health in the regions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a couple of important points. As she will know, there is already a structure for regional planning, which is a necessary part of the current planning process to define regional planning guidance. Under existing arrangements, there are linkages between all local authorities in those regions to produce regional planning guidance. It seemed sensible to use the opportunity to extend that to all the new regional assemblies, many of which already fulfil that function, as they represent local authorities and other interests. Local authority representatives are substantially in the majority on the existing regional assemblies, and it is right and proper for regional planning guidance, which is currently prepared by similar bodies, to be prepared by regional assemblies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the public expect the NHS to be a national service and health care to be provided on a similar basis throughout the United Kingdom. They look to Ministers to ensure that that happens and expect standards to be maintained everywhere. There is a concern for national delivery. However, as my hon. Friend rightly said, there is a regional dimension, and there should be a regional input through the role of the director of public health, which is analogous to what has been created in London. The national health service remains the responsibility of central Government, but the Mayor and London Assembly have a director of public health who is successfully highlighting specific issues of concern. That role can link with other factors that affect health policy. Whether we are talking about poor housing, environmental concerns, employment or transport—all of which can significantly affect the health of a community—it is right that there should be an integrated approach involving an elected regional assembly. At the same time, the maintenance of standards will continue to be the responsibility of Ministers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister talked about a reward grant, which sounds like a supermarket loyalty scheme. He said that there was no pressure on regions but if they voted for an assembly, they would get some extra bonus points. It is not entirely a free-for-all; there will be some financial manipulation for regions that agree to assemblies. Will he explain how big and attractive the rewards will be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper says that the regional assemblies will be democratic and not bureaucratic—heaven forbid that they should be bureaucratic—but the annual budget will be only £350 million. That is less than Devon county council's budget, so what will the assemblies do? Will they just co-ordinate everyone, or will they have teeth?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Norman Lamb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Talking shops.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's party does not think that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper says also that the assemblies will be responsive, with only 25 members. Some will be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
elected by the additional member voting system, which no one outside, or even inside, London really understands. Why are the Government trying to confuse everyone by having small regional authorities with a £350 million budget, 25 members elected by the additional member voting system and the supermarket-style bonus schemes? Does the Minister really think that that is the way to make regional government a success?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, in his inimitable way, has managed to cram about six different questions into his quota. I shall try to deal with them all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reward grant has been tried in experiments with local government during the past 18 months and has been extremely successful and popular.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bribery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not bribery. The local authorities that have signed up to local public service agreements, which are entirely voluntary, see them as an appropriate way of getting additional freedoms and flexibilities. If they meet stretched targets, they get additional resources. Everyone gains from that: the public get higher standards of service delivery, and the authorities receive additional finance for other things. Having spoken to several local authorities about their PSAs, I know that they have encouraged co-operative working with other bodies, which have shared some of the financial benefits. I do not share the hon. Gentleman's pejorative view. Most people in local government who have been involved would agree that it has been a success, and it is not inappropriate to suggest a similar framework for regional assemblies. We must remember, though, that these are early days and we are discussing only outline proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman then questioned whether 25 members would be sufficient for an elected regional assembly. There will be variations among regions and we are speaking about numbers in the range of 25 to 35, which will allow proper representation in each region. People will be represented by constituency members in each significant element in the region—no county will lack an individual representative and some will have more than one—while additional members will ensure that the overall composition of the assembly is proportionate to the votes cast. We have established that in Scotland, Wales and London, and it has worked well. It has ensured representation of all interests and a better representation of women and ethnic minorities than is the case in more traditional structures. That may be a by-product, reflecting the actions taken by political parties, but it is nevertheless a valuable and important contribution in establishing a more inclusive form of government. Furthermore, our experience in London is that having only 25 members represent a city of 7.5 million is not a disadvantage. The views of different parts of London have been adequately represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the budgets and quoted the illustrative figures for the north-east. That is the smallest region and the figures would be larger in other regions. We have given illustrative figures for another region in the White Paper, so he should not

see £350 million as the flat figure for all regions. The figure provides the correct balance by ensuring that the region has a significant ability to influence decisions not only through working with and influencing others, but by being able to take financial important decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be misleading if I did not say that an elected regional assembly should not take all the powers and try to resolve all the issues in its region by itself. We believe strongly in partnership working, which has been successful in many other parts of life. Local authorities working with public agencies and the private sector have been able to achieve more than bodies simply working on their own, and elected regional assemblies should work with local authorities, the private and voluntary sectors and community groups. Those partnerships will achieve more than a single body disposing of a budget and thinking only of what it can do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not see assemblies as falling into the pejorative description of a "talking shop". They will have considerable influence on outcomes in regions and are the right way to achieve results in a non-bureaucratic way—a lean body with proper democratic representation delivering value for money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How will the Minister take soundings? The Government want responses to the White Paper, which I welcome, by the end of August. It is important that the method of testing opinion is clarified in the next few days to inspire and galvanise people into responding. Also, do the proposals in the comprehensive spending review, which was recently announced, mean that we need a revised version of the regional budgets?

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins). He asked how we will take soundings about interest in elected regional assemblies and whether budgets will be revised following the spending review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the latter, he is absolutely right. The figures were published two months ago, prior to the spending review, and we were not able to reflect its figures. Revisions are needed, and in many cases they will involve significant increases in the sums available to the elected regional assemblies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the soundings, I can only repeat that we are already encouraging people to give us views and comments on many aspects of the White Paper, including how the stakeholders can be best represented and how we can best gauge opinion. We shall be setting out further proposals for consultation later on, but that should not preclude anyone giving us their views in the course of the next few weeks leading up to the period in which we have requested responses to the White Paper. It is a continuing process in which, as I have already said, it will be some time before we reach the stage of taking soundings, because legislation is required before a referendum can be considered. The referendum would be preceded by the Boundary Committee's consideration of local government reorganisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>John Mann 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bassetlaw)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which legislation will take precedence—that required for the election of mayors or this legislation? In Mansfield, the mayor's authority extends over a district. If the Boundary Committee recommended that the unitary authority should be the county, the district would be abolished. I know that the Minister will want to give precise details. Will he define the minimum size of a regulatory authority? Does he think that it is likely to be 100,000, 250,000 or 500,000?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend asked about possible conflict between this and other legislation. There is no potential conflict. If a review takes place, any existing district or county council will be subject to that review whether or not they have a mayor, cabinet or other structure of local government. From the soundings that I have taken so far however, I have not detected the strongest interest in the idea of an elected regional assembly from his region. The mayor of Mansfield will probably have a long time in office before the issue is considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although issues of efficiency may suggest a case for a minimum size, I have been careful not to prescribe one at this stage. We will consider the matter further and make our views known in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the matter of the White Paper 'Your Region, Your Choice: Revitalising the English Regions' (Cm. 5511, May 2002).—[	<i>Mr. Raynsford.</i>]</p></q></p>
	<p>6.7 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cotswold)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At least eight hon. Members wish to contribute to the debate, so I assure the Committee that I shall be brief. I am sure that the Minister would agree that the key to this issue is whether regional devolution gains the acceptance of the British people. Therefore, the way in which the process is brought about is very important. The Conservatives believe that, as far as possible, local services should be delivered locally and power should be devolved down to the lowest possible level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us exactly how the referendum will be funded, especially in the run-up from now onwards? I gather that a regional chamber called the north-east regional assembly is devoting funds to try to ensure that a yes vote is obtained in a referendum for a north-east assembly. In a democratic process, it is wrong that taxpayer's funds should go towards trying to influence an outcome either way, and I should like reassurance from the Minister about that. Once a referendum has been announced, who will be able to contribute funds to support each opposing side, and how much will they be allowed to contribute? Will there be a floor to the number of people who turn out for a referendum and vote for it? It would be wrong if, as happened in Wales, the eventual outcome were influenced by only about 4,000 people in a population of about 2.5 million. Safeguards must be built in in relation to either the number of people who vote in the referendum or the eventual majority accepted. I believe that in the Scottish referendum, originally, Jim Callaghan insisted on a two-thirds majority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just to reinforce my hon. Friend's figures, the turnout was 50.1 per cent.; 49.7 per cent. voted no, and 50.3 per cent. voted yes, so the figure was 0.6 per cent.. There was no procedure for a recount. Dividing that between 40 constituencies, there should have been a recount, which we were denied in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. Whatever the outcome of a referendum, it must be seen to be fair by the people who participate in it. In both national parliamentary elections and local government elections, turnouts are increasingly dropping. To any democrat, that must be a concern. We want answers from the Minister about how the referendums will be conducted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman) made a good point about planning. To what extent will the elected regional assembly be able to dictate to the unitary authorities, and in what areas? That is a particular concern in planning. Will it be able to hand down specific house-building targets to each unitary authority, or will each unitary authority be able to draw up its local plan and be allowed some autonomy in the matter? In what other areas will it be dictated to by the regional assembly?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, and, I believe, the Minister, was in the east midlands participating in a conference this week with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
my hon. Friend the Member for Romford (Mr. Rosindell). Concern has been expressed in the east midlands that other stakeholders, such as businesses and trade unionists, would not have a sufficient consultative role in regional assemblies. How can other stakeholders be involved? If they are not properly seen to be, and do not feel to be, involved, regional assemblies will not work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Considerable concern has been expressed that smaller, especially small rural, areas will be dominated by large urban areas. For example, areas of Cumbria might be worried about being dominated from Liverpool and Manchester, or Cornwall and Gloucestershire might be worried about being dominated by Bristol and Exeter. We need regional assemblies to have real democratic accountability and to be responsive to smaller areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are so many issues that I could raise, but I return finally to cost. The White Paper states that the administrative costs will be about £25 million each—that is, £200 million for the eight regional assemblies. Are we sure that those budgets are realistic, or shall we find those administrative budgets spiralling out of control? On a capital basis, when the Deputy Prime Minister's authority was reorganised, for that one authority the cost involved was £53 million. If that is translated to the rest of the country, the cost of reorganisation would seem to be about £2 billion. We should like to hear more from the Minister. The Welsh Assembly building cost £50 million, and the long-term lease on the London Assembly building is £120 million, so large costs are being built up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and the Regions (Mr. Nick Raynsford)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister shakes his head, but those are actual costs that have been incurred by those bodies. He must explain what the capital costs will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bodies will no doubt have to have premises in Brussels. The Minister brushed that aside, saying that their existing lobbying arrangements may be suitable, but you can bet your bottom dollar that once people are in post, with all their civil servants, they will want buildings in Brussels. What will that cost?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What scrutiny powers will the House have over regional assemblies? Will we find the same as happens in relation to Welsh and Scottish questions, whereby we, elected Members of Parliament, are completely debarred from asking questions on a raft of policy issues in those regions? That would be unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will elected regional assemblies put a single policeman, teacher or social services worker on the ground, or will they cost the people of this country a huge amount of money for very little gain?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Louise Ellman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, Riverside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the White Paper and congratulate the Government on the seriousness with which they have addressed the issue of regional devolution. The proposals in the White Paper build on the important work of RDAs and the growing work of the existing regional chambers and regional assemblies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0621">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
I also welcome the Government's recognition that devolution in the United Kingdom is not to be confined to Scotland, Wales and, in England, only London, and, of course, Northern Ireland. This is an opportunity for the English regions. It is important that the White Paper is considered properly and that the Minister and the Government give full consideration to all the comments made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three major ways in which the White Paper should be addressed. The first is to examine economic disparities to find out whether regional devolution will enhance the work of RDAs, whose remit is to consider the economic potential of the entire region, including both rural and urban areas. The second relates to the democratic deficit. Many bodies that already operate at a regional level are not accountable to people in the regions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady agree that people feel closer to their district and county councils than they would to a regional government? Does she believe that people voting for regional government should know what the local government at the lower level will be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ellman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a grave error to assume that regional devolution is about taking over local government powers. It must not do that, and the proposals do not suggest that. Regional devolution is about giving people in the regions greater power and control over bodies that already operate regionally where local government does not have any influence and where regional strategies and matters of regional significance are considered that will work in tandem with, I hope, stronger local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third area that should be addressed in considering regional devolution relates to enhancing the power of people in the regions to influence Government decisions taken at a national level that will have a regional impact. Those must include matters that relate to central Government, allocation of resources and the development of European Union policies that will influence the regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Minister's attention to several areas of concern in the proposals in the White Paper. The first is the number of elected representatives that the Government consider appropriate. The Government are correct in wanting to ensure that elected regional government does not mean new bureaucracies, but I ask them to think again about whether the upper figure of 35 members is adequate for a region such as the north-west that comprises just under 7 million people. It is important that people in the region identify with the elected regional assembly. Might further consideration be given to that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, in considering economic disparities and democratic deficit, the proposals in the White Paper for bringing accountability to the regional development agency are welcome. They strike the right balance. It is correct that an elected body should appoint the board of the development agency and decide its strategy. The regional development agency, as an operational body, should remain private-sector
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
led and be free to implement that strategy. It is important that ways are devised in which the agency has continuous consultation with the elected assembly to ensure that that strategy is being implemented and can deal with emergencies and new issues that arise in the normal course of events.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I worry about the democratic deficit in general and how that is dealt with in the White Paper. I note the Minister's earlier comments that often those in Opposition find it easy to be against quangos, but that Governments sometimes find it easier to live with them. The proposals for regional quangos should be tightened up in the White Paper. Paragraph 4.2 on page 34 refers to elected assemblies having responsibility for
	<br><q><p>"investment in regeneration, improving housing and public transport, and developing tourism."</p></q>
However, there is not great detail in the White Paper about how that responsibility can be exercised and how accountability can be brought to the regional quangos that already operate in the regions. If they are not to disappear, will they be accountable to the regional assembly, if only in a reporting sense? Will they be allowed to carry on as they are, with the regional assembly simply noting that they exist? Will the decisions taken by regional quangos be brought more into focus? Will they be forced to work together more closely and report to the assembly? Will the assembly have an input?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen to the Learning and Skills Council, to which reference was made earlier? If we are considering the development of the economy, the development of training and the acquisition of skills are absolutely essential aspects to take into account. How will the council relate to the elected assembly? When considering important areas such as regeneration and the arts, how will the fact that the Government have now decided to bring more centralisation to the arts by abolishing regional arts councils relate to the wish to have more regional devolution? The existing regional cultural consortiums are nebulous. Regional arts, the spending that goes with that and the regeneration impact of that linked to the work of English Heritage, which already operates regionally, must be dealt with by an elected accountable body. I see little reference to that in the White Paper. There are certainly no firm proposals about such connections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On page 34, the White Paper refers to elected assemblies having responsibility for issues such as
	<br><q><p>"improving housing and public transport".</p></q>
How can such matters be dealt with and how can the elected assembly be responsible for them if it has either no powers over such matters or extremely nebulous powers? Powers are not dealt with in the White Paper, although the word "influence" appears many times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Public transport is clearly mentioned in the White Paper, and it is accepted as a major issue. What will be the relationship between the elected regional assembly, the Strategic Rail Authority and Network Rail when considering rail systems? Will those bodies, and, indeed, the Highways Agency, be required to consult the regional assembly? Will the assembly's views on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0622">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
transport to be taken into account when national transport plans are drafted? Is it envisaged that an elected regional assembly should be able to plan regional rail services? There is much closer knowledge at a regional level about what is required within that region than there could ever be nationally. I am concerned that such issues are touched upon in the White Paper, but there are no firm proposals about the powers to be vested in an elected regional body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the key issues that must be resolved if regional devolution is to be successful is how the directly elected regional bodies will be able to influence central Government decisions. Housing investment has already been mentioned. I hope that regional assemblies will have an influence on the Government's formulae for allocating regional investment. Until very recently, the national formulae used to allocate investment funds for housing at a regional level were based much more on the interests of the south-east, especially the problem of homelessness, which took precedence over the need for regeneration in the north and the midlands. That is now being redressed, but only because there is much greater regional consciousness and the Government are listening to regional issues that have been brought to them. However, such issues must be dealt with nationally and there must be a regional influence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another area of concern in relation to national decisions that affect the regions, which is of particular interest to the north-west at the moment, is spending on research and development and Government influence on that, or where Government allocated funds for research and development actually end up. I was pleased to hear in my hon. Friend the Chancellor's statement earlier this week that there are to be major new funds for science and research and a major new allocation to the Office of Science and Technology, but who in that office will decide where to allocate the research spending? The north-west is still reeling from the shock of losing the massive investment in Diamond Synchrotron that went from Daresbury to Oxfordshire in the south-east. We still await news of where the Centre for Science, Imaging and Medicine project will be located—hopefully it will be at the Daresbury laboratory in the north-west, which has essential links with the university of Liverpool. That would have a massive impact on Liverpool and the north-west in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The allocation of funds for research projects will be decided through bodies such as the Office of Science and Technology. As the Government increases funding, how are we to ensure that there is a regional influence on where funds are allocated? With no regional input, and if the elected regional assemblies have no influence, funds may increasingly be allocated nationally with no guarantee that the impact of regional need and opportunity will be taken into account by officials in their recommendations and decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the White Paper. I assume that some time will elapse between its publication and the passing of the necessary legislation to make the proposals a reality. I hope that Ministers will use that time to strengthen those proposals, because those of us who
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
support regional devolution want to ensure that assemblies are not talking shops—even ones with influence. They should have the power to make a difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last Friday, I attended the annual meeting of the north-west regional assembly which was held in Keswick, Cumbria, along with more than 600 other delegates from a wide variety of organisations, including local authorities, the private and voluntary sectors, trade unions, universities and the national health service. The meeting demonstrated yet again the strength of feeling in the north-west, from a wide variety of people from many different sectors, about the need for a regional voice. I want to ensure that the White Paper gives us that regional voice. We should also increase regional influence and give the north-west and other regions the power to develop their potential, develop what people want to see within their regions, and influence the Government to make their lives better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Andrew George 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(St. Ives)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside on setting the exact tone of the debate, the line of inquiry and the level of scrutiny that is necessary. The White Paper is a welcome move by the Government to establish regional government throughout England. However, questions must be asked about how it will be done. The hon. Lady has rightly raised serious issues, most of which I echo. She mentioned the well-attended meeting of the north-west campaign group in Keswick.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it is inconvenient for the Government and others, I must stress that 50,000 people in Cornwall and elsewhere have given their support to the campaign for a Cornish assembly, the boundary for which does not match that favoured by the Government. Although the Government and some of their supporters want to head off such a decision with a "cart before the horse" initiative to campaign for a single unitary authority in Cornwall, they must face up to the fact that communities and regions will not necessarily agree with their proposals. The theme of my argument is sincere. Liberal Democrats want to make sure that the Government will succeed in delivering genuine devolution to genuine regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper is entitled "Your Region, Your Choice", but people who want devolution believe that it should be re-entitled "The Government's Region, The Government's Choice". Throughout the White Paper, the Government seem not to have sufficiently constrained their control freak tendency. They must understand that devolution is about letting go, not hanging on. Clearly, the regions are the Government's clearly defined regions. It seems that nothing else will be acceptable. The hon. Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Mr. Wyatt) rightly asked questions about people's views and whether such a debate should take place. It will be difficult; it could be messy, but such discussions would result in more effective devolution and shapes of regional government that are not envisaged at present by the Government. Such action may provide solutions to issues that will otherwise result in a stalemate and no devolution. We do not want to see that happen.

The White Paper deals with Government zones, not regions with which people can identify and that have an internal integrity. I take off my hat to those campaigning in the north-east and the north-west. It is not for me to judge whether certain regions exist. Campaigning is taking place in Yorkshire, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall gladly give way to the hon. Lady. In a previous debate, she tried to interpret the fact that the 50,000 people who clearly supported a Cornish declaration supported a south-west regional assembly. Perhaps she will clarify her position in her intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Atherton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misinterpreted what I said. I said that not everyone was aware of what they were signing up to with the Cornish assembly, but that is for a another debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In congratulating people who have campaigned around the country—in the north-east and the north-west—for their own regional assembly, is the hon. Gentleman aware that people in our region of the south-west are also campaigning for their own assembly? Will he also congratulate them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume that the hon. Lady supports that campaign. I should like to know whether anyone else in Cornwall supports it as I have yet to find them. When the hon. Lady speaks later in the debate, perhaps she can elucidate on that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that a general constitutional convention has been working closely with the Cornish Constitutional Convention and they are shortly to publish a joint report on joint modelling to deal with the issue of mutual respect and recognition. Their conclusions about the viability of regions, which are also addressed in the Government's paper, are interesting. If we raise our eyes above the rather insular and parochial view of the UK and look to Canada, other nations in Europe and elsewhere, variable geography and asymmetry deliver a much more chilled-out, less control-freakish form of devolution, which allows for genuine regions to emerge and manage their own affairs at an appropriate level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Cousins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon.

I should like the genuine will and ambition of the people of any region to be fulfilled. As the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) and those living in Gloucestershire and Dorset know, some regions do not relate to the Government zone, which is synthetic and has been set up for bureaucratic convenience. Such issues are better resolved by the people themselves. I spoke to people on the Welsh borders in Herefordshire, Shropshire and elsewhere
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
who would not favour a regional assembly for the west midlands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me first deal with the issue raised by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is whether there is internal integrity in a Welsh borders region, which would include Gloucestershire. We therefore need an opportunity to consider better-shaped, more appropriate regions with which people can identify. The South West Constitutional Convention is a very small body, which receives little, if any, expression of popular support. Unlike in the north-east, north-west and Yorkshire, there is no proposal on the table—at least, no serious proposal based on strong public support—for a south-west regional assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me try again. The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well, as he has already elucidated, that the Government's proposals for a south-west regional assembly stretch from the Isles of Scilly in the south-west to Tewkesbury in the north and Southampton in the east. He knows perfectly well, from the written parliamentary answers that the Minister has given, that the Government are not prepared to change those boundaries. With those boundaries, would the hon.

While he is answering that, perhaps he can tell us whether he is in favour of a regional income tax as well as a national and a local one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the Committee that a number of hon. Members still wish to speak and we have less than 30 minutes left.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do my best to answer. I was hoping that my contribution would provoke some debate and intervention and I am pleased that it has.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph 6.5, the Government make it clear that they will not necessarily stick to existing government boundaries. From my private conversations with those who have been involved in the process but are no longer, and from speaking to others involved in the process who are not in this Committee now, it has become clear to me—I am happy to wager money on this—that regional devolution is not deliverable on the present construct of the south-west. I do not believe that there is public support out there for it or that the proposal will get to the stage of a referendum. Therefore, the question of whether I would vote for it if there were such an opportunity does not arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was attempting to get into my stride with my introductory comments when interventions began. On the title of the document and the questions of whose region it is and what choice there is, the first point to be made concerns what kind of choice is being offered to people, especially where the powers are concerned. In my earlier question to the Minister, I said that in my view many people who look at the White Paper will think that it is not worth breaking into a sweat about. I said that not from opposition but from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0624">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
disappointment, reflecting, I think, the views of other hon. Members. There is disappointment that the powers proposed in the document are largely those of scrutiny and quangos, not powers that could provide regional assemblies with any teeth. I imagine that many people who want regional assemblies to succeed believe that it is worth putting a great deal of effort into them. I should like to see the sort of devolution that would make that process worthwhile.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The potential for confusion over public health relating to the powers has not been raised elsewhere. The paper proposes that, as well as having strategic health authorities and primary care trusts and giving Government offices a role in health matters, there will be a public health remit for the regional assemblies. That might add to possible confusion for the public over where they should go for support, advice, answers or action to address health issues in their region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Still on the subject of powers, there is a proposal to have high-level indicators. Although that reflects the Chancellor's theme of wanting to have control over all matters on which Government money is spent, right down to school level, it runs against the spirit of devolution because it offers a reward if assemblies meet Government targets. It will be hard for assemblies to contemplate significant innovation or policy divergence in such circumstances, especially where those indicators and rewards do not apply to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) mentioned the unitary structure and whether the statements on that in the White Paper provide a hostage to fortune for the Government. University college, London, identified that as a problem in its response, saying that those proposals could stifle regional government at birth because they would be a gift to Opposition parties—not ours—that want to campaign to save the shire counties. Why have the Government departed from their previous position of wanting predominantly unitary local government before the setting up of regional assemblies? That would seem a wiser position to take in the circumstances. Experience in Europe suggests that moving away from that is not necessarily a precondition of regional government, which the Government themselves show in the White Paper. France, Germany, Italy and Spain have either retained, or not found it necessary to abolish, a two-tier structure of regional government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Boundaries, and the question of what is a region, will be the Achilles heel of the proposal, especially as we go further south in the country—to the south-east or the south-west—for reasons that I touched on earlier. That question is addressed properly neither in the White Paper nor by the Government. It was relatively easy for the Government to achieve devolution for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland because we knew that those places existed and there was little quibble about their boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an earlier debate, I asked the Minister whether the Government were obsessed with the boundaries that they had defined or whether they were prepared to debate them and take a more flexible line. At that stage, he said that of course they were not obsessed.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
However, the document implies that they are pretty obsessed with those boundaries, apart from a caveat in paragraph 6.5. There is an emperor's clothes question here that needs to be asked and will increasingly be asked as the process goes forward. What will we do if a region does not actually exist?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For regions such as Cornwall, the north-east and elsewhere, the process will be an object in itself and just as exciting as the actual achievement. It will be exciting for me personally because I enjoy challenging tired old metropolitan prejudices about small places, but it will also have the capacity to galvanise our community and help the promotion of our brand and distinctiveness in Cornwall. It will build self-confidence in a place where that has been lacking for a long time. Thanks to the Government, and thanks to campaigns in Cornwall, we have achieved at European level recognition of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly as a region for the purposes of the delivery of objective 1 funds. The campaign in Cornwall is popular and it is also very young. It is interesting that it is particularly well supported by young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that the Government have produced their White Paper and have the opportunity to reflect, I urge them to reflect on the scrutiny that the paper has been given in this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Wyatt 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sittingbourne and Sheppey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, but I may have to leave early because I have a speaking engagement elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put on the record that my father-in-law is Alan Willet, chairman of the South East England Development Agency. I have said before that I think it wrong of the Government to appoint relatives of MPs to positions of authority in the same areas as their constituency boundaries. It has caused my family real and deep heartache that my own father-in-law has been in charge of my area. That will become apparent during my short speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support regional government, but I also think that constitutional reforms in the United Kingdom are muddled. If we could start again, I think that Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland should have their own Assemblies or Parliaments, but so should England. By definition, that would make the House of Lords into a house of representatives, and we could then develop a further system underneath that in England. I recognise that very few people in the House share my views, but that seems to me the logical development from granting devolution to Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister confirm that it is in accord with UK human rights law for a regional assembly to be set up in a separate part of England and that if there were one in one place and not in another, people would not be able to bring a case that they had been disenfranchised? Has the Minister looked into that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the regional government map itself, I have some empathy with the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George) and the Basque republic regarding whether it can be redrawn. If I obtained 150,000 signatures from the Thames gateway region and delivered them to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0625">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
Electoral Commission, saying that we wanted an elected assembly but not on the current map, I wonder what its reaction would be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can I tease the Minister a little more on the question of universities? Although we exchanged some light-hearted comments, the fact of the matter is that the bay area in San Francisco is the tenth largest economic area in the world. That powerhouse has derived from Stanford university at one end and Berkeley at the other. Stanford gave us Hewlett-Packard, venture capital, Sun Microsystems—"Sun" stands for the Stanford university network. They are among the top 50 companies in the world. Recently, it has given us Yahoo. Interestingly, venture capital funds have been given not to regions, but to universities. Therefore, there will be more spun-off businesses in universities in the bay area than anywhere else because they are sharper and the universities act as the economic engine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any regional area, there are many universities fulfilling different functions—some are excellent and some are rubbish. We cannot allow that system to continue. Will the Minister look at it again? We have national museums and galleries, and we have allowed regional arts councils to look after regional arts strategies with the regional museums. We also have global universities—six, seven, eight or nine—and we have to allow the regional assembly to set its own structure for its own universities. My only concern is that we seem so nervous about letting people decide what they would like best locally. We are letting them have five things, but not 10. It is as though we do not trust them to take hold of their own lives and destinations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other hon. Members have raised this point, but I wonder how the regions will be accountable to us. Do the Government intend to have a Minister for the Regions, or a Minister for each region, or will there be a Select Committee for the Regions or Select Committees for each region? I wonder how we are thinking about the accountability of the regions in our system. That would seem sensible if we are going to give the regions responsibility on some elements of health, education and planning. It is confusing. We are the Members for those areas, and at some stage it would be nice if we could work together and ensure that we are accountable to one another, while developing a relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has been opaque about the Barnett formula. I understand that because it causes the Government huge embarrassment. However, the reason why Scotland can afford health care and free higher education is that for 27 years or more, it has received substantially more money per citizen than the English regions. If there is to be a fairer way forward after the three-year comprehensive spending review, we have to resolve a new Barnett formula over the next 10 years. It would be unfair not to. I suspect that that will require a commonwealth of meetings between the four bodies. I do not know who would represent the English bodies. Would it be each of the regions, then Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland? The sooner
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
that vehicle is created, then the sooner we can talk about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last Wednesday, a company in my constituency went into receivership. At least 400 jobs were lost immediately, and perhaps another 400 will be lost. Who does one ring first? I did not ring SEEDA, the Government office for the south-east or the assembly. I rang the Secretary of State and asked what the hell was going on. In fact, SEEDA, GOSE and the assembly had not bothered to ring me. That goes to show that if we want the bodies to be economic generators but we are not careful and only give them some powers, it will lead to huge confusion. We must be certain what the powers will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why I am here is straightforward. I do not want necessarily to be destructive about the proposals; I want to speak in support of local government. I shall not repeat the questions of the hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside, but she and the hon. Member for St. Ives expressed, in different ways, disappointment in the proposals because they felt that they were not sufficiently radical or positive about regional government. My problem is that the proposals are regional window dressing and will draw to a regional level powers that are at present the responsibility of local government, while not giving assemblies many of the real powers that are exercised in the regions by central Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ellman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lansley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot be brief if I am to be interrupted, but I am happy to give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ellman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman note that my comments welcomed the proposals and wanted them to be stronger on regional aspects? I did not cast any aspersions about local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lansley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has a record in local government so I shall not dispute what she says. However, it may have helped if she had realised what were contained in the proposals before asking some of her questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the hon. Lady asked questions about transport, but she should consider what is in the White Paper relating to transport. One question was how much money will be disbursed by the regions for transport—I am old fashioned enough about government to think money should be tracked—and the example from the north-east states that £1 million will be disbursed to the regional passenger partnership fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another question relates to the influence of the regional assembly on transport. The assembly will not be spending money, or have the powers of the Highways Agency, the Strategic Rail Authority or Network Rail, as the hon. Lady proposed it could and was disappointed that it would not. Those powers will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0626">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
lie in the regional transport plan. Will regional assemblies be exercising Government power? No. The regional transport plan will be passed to the Government and Ministers for them to make decisions. The power that will be exercised by regional assemblies will effectively be that currently administered by local authorities in local transport plans. For the east of England therefore, Cambridgeshire's local transport plan will be substantially second guessed by a regional transport plan, and Cambridgeshire, or whatever structure of local government may exist, will be overtaken. That is not devolution, but window dressing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was perfectly obvious, when we were asking the Minister questions, that there are a number of high-level targets, so regional assemblies will not really be free to do as they want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid I must return to the money. Some £350 million will be available for the north-east, which is the smallest region with probably the largest proportion of Government expenditure in the hands of the regional assembly. The Government figures state that that is 5 per cent. of central Government net expenditure for social security in the north-east; a similar figure applies to the north-west. In practice, assemblies are supposed to have responsibility for those budgets. The White Paper states that assemblies
	<br><q><p>"will have … freedom to spend their grant as they judge best"</p></q>
but we know that that is not true. Let us look at the paper bit by bit. It states that the
	<br><q><p>"Regional Development Agency … will retain its present day-to-day operational independence",</p></q>
which will include the single pot. The RDAs will be able to allocate their funds from the single pot, and not according to the regional assembly. Business support budgets will be subject not to control, but to consultation. The learning and skills councils budgets will be the largest over which the assemblies have influence, but they will have only a consultation role and no control. EU structural funds will be subject to regional delivery within a "clear national framework", and the Minister has confirmed that there is no scope to move money out of the European programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an opportunity to allocate money for housing at a regional level, but I suspect that that will overtake what might be called local devolution, or devolution to upper-tier authorities. On transport, we know that there is no money, so there is no real control. On arts, tourism and sport, money will be devolved, but
	<br><q><p>"in a way which protects strategic national priorities."</p></q>
I imagine that, if I read it correctly, for the England rural development programme too, money will be controlled by that programme and administered and influenced, rather than controlled, by the regional assemblies. The net result will involve 5 per cent. of central Government expenditure in the north-east of England and probably 1 or 2 per cent. in the south-east and east of England. Is that worth it and is this the right way to achieve the aim?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go on at length but it seems that of the powers that the regional assemblies will take under this
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
structure, those that will matter most in practice are planning powers—the planning powers of local authorities. I see no evidence here that the planning powers of the Secretary State will be devolved to the regional assemblies. There may be powers and budgets for housing here, but could those not be more effectively devolved to local authorities than to the regional assemblies? The powers involved in the transport strategies could be devolved to local authorities through their local transport plans. There is absolutely nothing to say that local authorities cannot come together, as they do in the planning conference, to create a regional transport plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On regional development agencies, I shall not get into a long debate over whether they are a good or a bad thing, but if they are doing their job well—for the sake of argument, let us say that in one or two regions, they are—will they welcome the assemblies in this form? They will no longer be able to have regional business representatives in the form in which they have had them up till now. There will be business people on them, but they will be chosen by the regional assemblies, not nominated by the business community in any real sense. Regional development agencies should be a real partnership between local authorities and the business community, not a product of the decisions of a regional assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Devolution could happen, and could happen far more effectively. It ought to happen, but it ought to happen through local authorities and, conceivably, different regional structures. For example, the Devon and Cornwall development corporation would have been a perfectly acceptable basis on which to structure regional development in that part of the south-west, without having to have a full regional development agency. We had development corporations in the north-east before we had One NorthEast. It would have been perfectly possible to build on that. We want different structures in different parts of the United Kingdom, substantially based on local authorities that can come together at different geographical levels to deliver services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are not only imposing regional window dressing, as the hon. Member for St. Ives said, but imposing, perversely, a structure on local authorities as a consequence. It is complete nonsense and logical absurdity for the Minister to say that there will be no change in local authorities' powers but that, nevertheless, the structure of local authorities must be radically changed as a consequence of the proposal. In practice, there will be a change in their powers. If an area such as the east of England has a regional assembly—although I do not think that it will—it will mean, for the vast majority of the public, a change in the form in which local government is delivered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister wants devolution, he should go about it in a different way. I want devolution, but I want it based on local authorities. If there is a case for it, as there might be, for example, in the north-east, I have a suggestion for the hon. Members for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central and for Liverpool, Riverside. When the time comes, they should not accept proposals of this kind, but argue for aspects of local government to come together. If the north-west and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0627">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
north-east want regional bodies, they can easily create them by bringing together the Members of Parliament in those regions. If the north-east wants 30 elected individuals whose job it is to represent that region and who have the potential to speak for it and influence the choice of strategies, why do not the Members of Parliament for the north-east—30 of them—just sit down and do that job, rather than having £25 million spent on bureaucracy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister told us today that if there are not referendums leading to regional assemblies, the Government offices will be strengthened. That will be regionalism under another name, which will not be democratic. Will my hon. Friend speculate on that and on the powers that would then be taken away from local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lansley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. In the east of England it is probably a more significant point than the question of regional assemblies because they are not wanted and will not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Cambridgeshire, we know perfectly well what regionalism means in that context. It means taking decisions out of our hands, and it often means that decisions are taken that make no sense—for example, the recent options include creating a city the size of Milton Keynes between London and Cambridge. I will not elaborate, but that makes no sense for a whole range of reasons. It will strangle one of the geese that lays our golden eggs, of the same sort referred to by the hon. Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey. If there is any university that stands any chance of doing anything remotely like Stanford has done, it is Cambridge university. One cannot achieve that if a regional planning conference thinks that it would be convenient to put down 100,000 homes in a gap in the map, hoping that it does not have any impact on the economic development of the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am going to stop because otherwise I shall go on as long as some other hon. Members. My purpose is simply to say that we should strengthen local government and the mechanisms for local government to achieve genuine devolution, instead of doing it through regional window dressing, which is the Government's approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>John Mann 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bassetlaw)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My points have not been made; I think that I am in a bit of a minority in this Room, but probably not in the country. The Minister wanted some feedback and suggestions. My first suggestion is that the question could be framed "Do you want more elected politicians?" I have seen no mood for more elected politicians. There seems to be a mania for creating more—mayors, the House of Lords and so on. I have not noted larger and larger turnouts in the referendums to date. The post of Mansfield mayor, which I opposed, and thankfully my bit of Mansfield voted heavily against, was established by 11 per cent. of the voters. I hope that there will be some clear guidelines and minimum tests built in, so that we do not end up with something sneaked in by
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
the back door when people cannot be bothered to vote because they are not that interested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we talk about devolution, we should also talk about empowerment. My constituency is rather interestingly situated. It is in Nottinghamshire—the east midlands—which is not mentioned in the White Paper. In fact, Nottinghamshire is only mentioned in terms of Nottingham. Our health authority is in Yorkshire. Our radio is based in Sheffield and Nottingham, depending on where people live in the constituency. The same is true of television, although Yorkshire Television in my constituency is the Lincolnshire version of Yorkshire Television, and we have both Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire telephone codes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The unions have always built their structures where industry is based. The regional office of the Transport and General Workers Union for my constituency is based in Birmingham. The regional office for the General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trades Union is based in Leeds. The regional office for the Communications Workers Union is based in Sheffield. The regional office of Unison is based in Nottinghamshire. However, the most pertinent example is that of the National Union of Mineworkers. In my constituency, there are villages where one part of the village comes under the Derbyshire NUM and the other half comes under the Nottinghamshire NUM, so during the strike, one part of a village went on strike and the other part did not. Harworth, which is 10 miles north of Worksop, the main town in my constituency, is in the Nottinghamshire NUM because of strike action or inaction in the 1920s and 1930s. Manton colliery, 10 miles to the south, has always been in the Yorkshire NUM, and so Manton went on strike, but Harworth did not. There are real communities of interest, often within the same village. The village of Shireoaks is in Nottinghamshire. The pit has always been in Derbyshire, but Shireoaks NUM has always been in Yorkshire. There is no better example than that of the arbitrary nature of regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my area, the biggest economic issue by far—we have a petition with tens of thousands of signatures—is Finningley airport. We want the airport, but where is it? The runway goes to the very borders of my constituency. Thirty years ago, it used to be in my constituency, in Nottinghamshire—the east midlands—and Yorkshire. Yorkshire now has the runway, but I have all the airspace. The map identifies airports, but Finningley is not to be found on the Yorkshire or east midlands maps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come from Yorkshire, and I know that the birth criteria for those who wanted to play for Yorkshire country cricket club—the rules existed for more than 100 years—meant that people from Grimsby were not allowed to play for Yorkshire. If the proposals go through, Yorkshire and the Humber area will both be in the same region, so we need to be wary. I do not really care if there is overwhelming demand for a regional assembly in the north-west or the north-east—if that is what the majority of people want, they are welcome to it—but the Minister will find no one in my area who wants it.

I should like unitary authorities to be carved out without having to impose another structure. That would be popular. We could then, say, get shot of the county council. I am prepared to argue for that; we could have a referendum on it. I would put my neck on the line in support of getting shot of the county council and having a unitary authority. What worries me is that the boundary review's tinkering will have all sorts of ramifications, whether or not the people want regional government. The minimum size of a unitary authority is therefore fundamental. My authority area, Bassetlaw district council, has 106,000 people. If that is deemed to be too small, what size should it be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real nightmare is that, because the county council has said that it would be the unitary authority, we will be stuck with a county council in Nottingham and regional government in Northamptonshire or somewhere similar. What will that mean for mining communities? They are not linked to cities, which is one of the big issues that needs to be addressed. We do not want to be isolated by the cities getting more and more power, as has happened during the past 20, 30 or 40 years. During that time, my communities have been isolated in terms of resources, and we end up being statistics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nottinghamshire published its social statistics last week. On its criteria, one of the poorest areas is shown as being one of the wealthiest. Mining villages have some of the worst poverty in the country, but because the county council borders are arbitrary and because posh new estates have been built on the fields where most of the pits were to be found, the statistics show that, according to every criteria, those villages are no longer deprived. That is not empowerment for the people in my area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We might be different from other areas—we might be unique—but we are caught on the boundary with Yorkshire. If we were allowed the chance to talk to Yorkshire, there might be more enthusiasm about a regional boundary. I am not sure what complications that might cause, but such consultation needs to be incorporated into the review so that we have some feedback. However, we are not going to keep quiet about the city having more power, and allowing devolution to move resources from our areas to the city. We have had too much of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing has been mentioned. Worksop in my constituency has been waiting for 30 years, despite consulting various levels of local government, to get rid of its slum housing. I must tell the Minister that his Department is now sorting that out. The announcement has already been made within the civil service, and it will soon be made formally. I should like to invite a senior politician to launch the programme in Bolsover, Bassetlaw and Mansfield. For the first time in 30 years, we shall be able to start sorting out the slum housing owned by private racketeer landlords. In the end, it was appropriate Government action that worked. What I do not want is layers of bureaucracy and committees miles away in Northamptonshire—we have nothing in common with that area—having their say and sticking their oar in on matters about which they know nothing.

	<p>7.14 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Atherton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the White Paper. I speak from a parochial standpoint, especially given how little time I have. I am concerned that we in Cornwall and the south-west in general might miss the boat if we do not take the opportunities that the White Paper offers. It provides an opportunity for debate on how we tackle our regional issues, such as transport and planning issues and the accountability of the regional development agencies. I should inform the hon. Member for St. Ives that the issues do not stop at the Tamar bridge; they affect our neighbours and our neighbours affect us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of boundaries has dominated the entire debate in the western half of the south-west, but it is not the only issue. For most people in Cornwall, the issue is about devolving power to the most appropriate level, such as a regional assembly, a Cornish assembly, or a unitary, district or town council. Different people are talking about delivering different levels of power to different layers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We in Cornwall are on the margins, but we are linked to our neighbours. I support the idea of a regional assembly complemented by unitary authorities. I believe that 500,000 people would be too many for one single Cornish unitary authority, and favour instead two unitaries in, perhaps, the east and west. That is what we should be debating—not wider boundaries in the south-west.

The opportunities are on the table and there for the county to take. I regret that the boundary debate has so completely dominated the media debate on devolution, while the issues behind the concept of an assembly have not figured. The question has simply been whether the Government will give Cornwall a Cornish assembly. When one actually talks to people, that is not what they are interested in; rather they are discussing how to take power from Whitehall or an elected quango and give it to the more marginal areas, on the periphery, such as Cornwall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of the focus on that part of the debate, we have fallen back in terms of the country as a whole. The north-east is way ahead of the wider south-west in the debate. We are being left on the margins, and we are partly to blame for the problem. Now that we know what is on the table, we need to come together and make the argument for a regional assembly. We can argue about boundaries later. We should seize the opportunity, because it would be short-sighted to reject it. In a few years' time, the north-east may have an assembly while Cornwall does not, and the 	<i>Western Morning News</i> will ask why the south-west regions of Devon and Cornwall have not seized their opportunities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In welcoming the White Paper, I acknowledge the contribution of my right hon. Friend the Member for Tyneside, North (Mr. Byers).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What a pleasure it has been this afternoon to welcome the neo-Hobbits of the Conservative party! How sweet and gentle the Conservative party is when it has no power, and what a recommendation that is for keeping things that way. The truth of the matter is that we have regional government, which was largely invented by the Conservative party. It was powerful, fragmented, unelected, invisible, unaccountable, wielded huge sums of money, took enormously influential decisions and no one had control over it. That was not enough for the Conservatives, however—they even abolished the regional health authorities, which were already not up to much, and replaced them with a regional health executive entirely under the control of Government. The Conservative party has to face up to the fact that it invented regional government. The question is whether we continue with that regional government without democratic control and accountability or introduce democratic control and accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper is not perfect. We would all want to go further. Indeed, I firmly believe that once regional assemblies are in place, they will go further. They will take up the regional agenda in the comprehensive spending review, which includes regional factors in its plans for education, housing, skills training, the labour market, police, security, tackling crime and building productivity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regional assemblies will take up that agenda. The task now is to bring them into being and make the existing regional government more accountable. That is the crucial first step. If some parts of the country do not want to do that, that is fine, as long as no one has a veto over those parts of the country that want to take that first step. In my own region, the north-east, we do. We shall say to our people, "Take that first step and vote yes in the referendum, because you will not be asked twice whether you want democratic accountability for regional government that already exists."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and the Regions (Mr. Nick Raynsford)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a good debate covering a range of issues. It has helped to identify some of the obvious priorities for the implementation of the proposals in the White Paper. I shall try briefly to refer to the specific issues raised by Members before making a few general observations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cotswold presented an interesting contradiction between his opening remarks and his concluding remarks. Opening the debate, he said clearly that he and his party believe that services should be delivered at local level. At the end, he criticised our proposals, saying that they would not put a single policeman, social worker or nurse on the ground. Of course they will not, because the assemblies will not be responsible for those services, which are rightly discharged at a local level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
The hon. Gentleman seems to be suggesting that social workers should no longer be the responsibility of local authorities but of regional assemblies. That would be an effective way of taking power away from local government, but we are not proposing to do that. The hon. Gentleman needs to think rather more clearly about his and his party's position on these issues. I shall come back to that when I deal with the issues raised by the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cotswold raised the question of a floor, asking whether there would be a minimum level of participation in the elections. He spoke about the relatively tight margin in Wales. He also mentioned the referendum in Scotland in the 1970s. That could not provide a better example of the problem of having a floor. The people of Scotland voted for devolution in the late 1970s, but it was denied them because there was an artificial floor. It took another 20 years to give them what they wanted. We do not believe that a floor is satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to encourage participation. The hon. Gentleman is wrong to say that turnout at elections is appalling. There was a higher level of turnout at the local elections in May this year than at the equivalent local elections four years before. It was not good enough, as it was up by only 5 per cent., but the figures are at least going in the right direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the involvement of stakeholders. We set out proposals in the White Paper and we invite comments on the matter. I referred to that in my earlier speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside spoke warmly in welcoming the proposals in the White Paper, and highlighted one or two areas of concern. First, she rightly emphasised that the assemblies would not take power from local government but would address the democratic deficit and ensure greater regional influence, all of which we agree with and endorse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend expressed concern about the numbers. In response to her question about whether 35 assembly members would be adequate for the north-west, a region with 7 million people, I cite the example of the Greater London Authority, which is doing pretty well with 25 members for a city of 7.4 million people. It should be possible, with a maximum of 35 members, to ensure adequate representation for every region in the country, none of which has a greater population than London. My hon. Friend asked whether quangos would be accountable, and they will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper refers specifically to the Housing Corporation's role. The budget that it currently decides will become the responsibility of the elected regional assembly, which is a significant shift.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also mentioned the arts. Paragraph 4.42 of the White Paper states:
	<br><q><p>"Where an elected regional assembly is established, our guiding principle will be that accountability and funding for the arts and sports which are regional in character will be devolved to the assembly".</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0630">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
There is therefore a clear commitment to devolution and to passing quangos' powers to elected regional assemblies in several instances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for St. Ives appeared to share some of the confusion that his party demonstrates over this and many other issues. At one point, he made it clear that the Liberal Democrats were absolutely committed to regional devolution. Later, however, he astonished me by saying that he did not know where the regions were or, indeed, whether they existed. His party is therefore committed to devolving powers to regions that he does not appear to believe exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for giving people throughout the country the opportunity to decide in which region they should be, that is the kind of recipe for chaos that Liberal Democrats love. Such an approach would prevent progress, because there would be endless debates and wrangles about boundaries and there would be no focus on action, which is what the Labour party believes in. It is a complete travesty to describe us as a control-freak party, when we have devolved power to Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London. We shall to do the same for those English regions that want power, and we are in business to do so practically and effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey asked whether the White Paper proposals were compatible with human rights, and we are satisfied that they are. I am sorry that he is upset about the person who chairs SEEDA; he obviously does not want to keep that role in the family. My hon. Friend is not here to hear me say this, although I may see him subsequently, but the chairman of SEEDA is not, to use my hon. Friend's words, in charge of the region. Indeed, if the south-east has an elected regional assembly, it will be in charge of the region. I shall pass over the other issues that my hon. Friend raised and respond to other hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire also revealed a degree of confusion, although this time it was in Conservative party thinking. He advocated that powers should be devolved to local authorities—that seemed to be the main thrust of his speech. Towards the end of his speech, however, he came up with the fascinating suggestion that a committee of Members of Parliament should represent each region. That is a classic illustration of confusion over roles. Hon. Members are here to deal with matters that affect the country as a whole, while local authorities are elected to deal with local matters. Between the two are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
issues that are best dealt with by elected bodies operating at the regional level, and that is the focus of our proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) expressed concern about being on the boundary, but we have not yet been able to find a way of devising boundaries that does not leave someone on the edge. I am afraid that that is the nature of democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have great sympathy for my hon. Friend's concerns about Worksop, which I visited as a Minister a few years ago. He is quite right about the appalling conditions there and about the need for action, and we are certainly trying to ensure that effective action is taken there and in other areas. The budget powers of elected regional assemblies, combined with a significant influence over housing, could be important in ensuring a sensitive response to each region's needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I am originally from Northamptonshire, there is no plan to locate the headquarters of the east midlands elected regional assembly there. They might just as well be in Bassetlaw as anywhere else, although I hasten to add that that is not a promise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Ms Atherton) rightly focused on the issue of devolving power, rather than on boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central made a lovely contribution and noted how sweet and gentle the Conservatives were when they had no power. Amen to that! They are not in power, and we can proceed as my hon. Friend wishes by ensuring that people in the regions have the opportunity to have elected regional assemblies that operate for their benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's record on devolution is a proud one, and our proposals take it further. The White Paper takes a pragmatic approach and it ensures that we concentrate on results, not rhetoric. As its name suggests, it gives people in the regions a real choice, and I commend it to the Committee and the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
