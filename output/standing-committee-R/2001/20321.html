I seek your guidance. Given that a regional White Paper will be issued in the next few months that will deal with the Government's position on the regions, it seems that this Committee has jumped the gun by being set up before that time. Has a locus been established in which to discuss the White Paper? If so, the Minister and members of the Committee can be released now and reconvene after it has been produced. Will that be acceptable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It would assist you and my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen) to know that the White Paper is secondary. If my hon. Friend reads the recent speech of the right hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson), he will see set out in admirable detail precisely how matters are to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Can you elucidate on what the right hon. Member for Hartlepool said?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not in a position to elucidate on what the right hon. Member said. As for the first matter, points of order are to do with the business of the Committee. Arranging debates in Standing Committee is a matter for the House authorities. My business is to conduct such debates, therefore the point about arranging when the Committee sits is not a point of order for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>2.1 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Employment and the Regions (Alan Johnson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to be in Committee to discuss the role of the regional development agencies. This is an important debate. RDAs are responsible for £1.5 billion of public spending a year. The timing of our discussions is excellent given that new budget arrangements will, in 10 days' time, give the RDAs freedom to spend the money according to the priorities that they agree with their regional stakeholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
RDAs are a key element of our national economic strategy. They are a crucial mechanism for ensuring that each region can take a strategic view of what needs to be done best to promote economic development and to engage partners, be they business, voluntary bodies or local authorities, to get on and do it. I look forward to an interesting debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our design of the RDAs, we are building on the general model of Scottish Enterprise and the Welsh Development Agency, while ensuring that the new institutions have the flexibility to respond to the special needs of their regions. I pay tribute to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
Conservative Ministers who developed the models, and hope that we can leave party political posturing to one side for a couple of hours while discussing such an important issue. That could be a vain hope, nevertheless I nurture it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth reflecting on why we set up RDAs. In 1996, Bruce Millan, the former European Commissioner, examined the successes and failures of regional policy and found a piecemeal, fragmented picture. There was a lot of useful activity, but different elements of it were not connected with each other and regions lacked ownership of various activities. Disparities between regions had widened and no region's performance was as good as it could have been. He recommended that a network of regional development agencies be set up to ensure real regional ownership of development activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the 1997 election, a White Paper entitled "Building Partnerships for Prosperity" was published in December that year. It built on the Millan report by making clearer the roles and functions of RDAs. It also separated the RDA for London, which was to form part of the structure beneath the elected Mayor and Assembly, from the RDAs in the eight remaining English regions. RDAs outside London were given legal status by the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 and became fully operational in April 1999. The London Development Agency came into being a year later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have followed a consistent policy on RDAs. They are intended to be powerful bodies that understand their region and have real roots in it. Our appointments process has ensured that regional interests are properly reflected on the boards that drive their activities. The agencies' primary focus is economic development, which is why we have ensured strong business representation on RDA boards. At least half the board members in most regions have current or very recent business experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Each RDA has drawn up regional economic strategies with regional partners that will guide their activities. Their close engagement with local partners means that they can direct resources to the real priorities of their regions. If Hon. Members believe that an RDA has not identified those needs correctly, they should engage with it closely as it revises and refines its strategies. Reasonable discussion between people of good will is the right way to resolve disputes over priorities, and I urge hon. Members to play a full role in the work of their RDAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the RDAs are to succeed in providing strategic economic leadership in their regions, it is essential that they have a clear mission. Each RDA has five statutory purposes: to further the economic development and regeneration of its area; to promote innovation, investment and business efficiency; to promote employment; to enhance the development and application of skills; and to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are clear that RDAs should act as the strategic drivers of economic development in their regions, which should provide the overall direction and focus
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0589">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
for their work. That does not mean that RDAs are barred from supporting projects with social or community content, if they judge them to be appropriate to their role. Their statutory purposes permit that. We do not, therefore, seek to be prescriptive about which projects the RDAs should and should not fund, as long as what is proposed matches their statutory purposes and fits coherently within an overall strategy that has a clear focus on the economic development of their region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I expect RDAs to work with their partners to see that a holistic approach to economic-regeneration initiatives is taken. We recognise that a variety of activities can support economic development, and we have no wish to micro-manage their activities, but when we assess the effectiveness of their performance, we will consider how well they have involved the private sector in their activities. We will also consider how well they have leveraged private sector funds, as their own funds are fairly small compared with the total economies of their regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We already have good examples of private sector engagement. The East Midlands Development Agency has recruited 500 business people to work voluntarily to help start-ups and voluntary and community organisations, and generally to champion the needs of business. Last year, the South East England Development Agency secured more than £220 million of private match funding for projects in which it was involved. That sum is nearly three times its own contribution to those projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to our views on the performance so far of RDAs, and to how the new single pot budget arrangements will enable them to carry out their mission more innovatively. I will also show how increasing resources and greater scope to set priorities are giving the RDAs new opportunities to meet the needs of their communities. I agree with those commentators who have remarked that the new RDAs have done little in their early years that is radical. We did not want them to make a big initial splash, only to disappear without leaving a ripple behind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To start with, the RDAs were given two primary tasks. The first was to run a series of programmes—11 projects in all—in land and property, regeneration and skills planning which central Government had administered. The second was to develop their economic strategies and, more importantly, to get regional buy-in into those strategies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wanted the RDAs to become part of the economic structure of their regions by forging links with companies, employees, universities and community bodies in their areas. That would not have happened without the process of building the economic strategies from the ground up. Writing those strategies was a substantial task; getting buy-in from partners was even more so. That excellent work helped to establish a firm jumping-off point that enabled us to make progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The RDAs made it clear to us that they needed resources and flexibility to do their task properly. Last year, we ensured that both were in place. In the current
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
financial review period, the RDAs will see their resources increasing from £1.5 billion this year to £1.7 billion in 2003–04.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps more significantly, next year will see the introduction of the single pot budget for the RDAs. It is easy to forget how radical a departure that is. In place of separate schemes, each with its own objectives and metrics, we will have a single pot measured against a set of agreed outcomes. Although it is important for the Government to direct the outcomes at national level, the RDAs are best placed to judge how those outcomes should be achieved in their regions. The RDAs now have the flexibility to use increased sums of money from five Government Departments to meet the aims of their economic strategies with much less bureaucracy. It is what they do rather than how they do it that interests the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another key advantage of the new single pot arrangements is that they enable money to be devoted quickly and flexibly to new priorities. For example, the London Development Agency devoted £3 million in emergency aid to the hospitality and tourism industries after the terrorist outrages of 11 September. The North West Development Agency, following the foot and mouth crisis, produced a rural recovery plan that contains £62 million of extra agency spending to promote economic development in rural areas. Indeed, the response to foot and mouth has shown the strengths of the RDA structure. We have seen how agencies have been able to identify regional needs, make a strong case to Government that they should be met and then ensure that the funds could be efficiently allocated to the firms that need them. In the south-west, for example, 1,200 businesses have received grant support totalling more than £8.5 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee of one particular example of when an RDA made a key impact at a time of major change. When there was a real threat in late 1999 that the Rover plant at Longbridge would shut down, with a devastating effect on small and large suppliers across the west midlands and on the local community, Advantage West Midlands promptly set up the Rover taskforce. It was a high-powered group of regional partners who worked extremely well together to identify the likely impact of such a closure and to come up with some innovative solutions. Although the threat receded, we are continuing to put funding into the group's proposals to modernise and diversify the automotive industry in the west midlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also working to ensure that the services that the Government provide through other means are joined up with the RDAs. For example, regional operations of the Small Business Service and Trade Partners UK are being co-located with the RDAs. RDAs will also work with local learning and skills councils, the Employment Service, firms, colleges, unions and others to agree regional frameworks for employment and skills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, following the 2001 election, primary responsibility for the RDAs was transferred to the Department of Trade and Industry. The move recognised that the driver of the RDAs' purposes— regeneration, skills, employment, sustainable development and innovation—is economic
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0590">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
prosperity. We now expect to see the RDAs helping to move the regional agenda forward. We have given them the resources that they said they needed and the flexibility that they said they wanted. We are now looking to them to deliver for their communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have set an overall framework of targets for the RDAs to achieve, which will ensure that they contribute to addressing national priorities for economic development. Those include targets relating to the regeneration of market towns, skills in the regional work force, and the reduction of social exclusion in the poorest wards in the region. In addition, each RDA has been asked to set output targets in four key areas: the number of hectares of land that will be regenerated through their efforts; the number of learning opportunities that they will support; the number of new businesses that their activities will either attract or support; and the number of jobs whose creation or safeguarding will result from their activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have given the RDAs the flexibility and discretion to decide how they propose to meet their targets, including through region-specific outputs that they have now put to us for agreement in their corporate plans. In drawing up and implementing those plans and their regional strategies, we expect the RDAs to work closely with regional and local partners. That should include taking into account the role of other partners, the effect of the availability or otherwise of other resources in an area, and how that will impact on their overall strategy for the economic development of the region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regional assemblies will also work with RDAs to ensure that their activities mesh with their agreed regional economic strategies. We have given each regional assembly £5,000 to help with that. We expect shortly to approve the corporate plans for next year, which will show great variety and innovation in how RDAs are dealing with the particular issues for their regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also introducing a rigorous monitoring system across RDAs that will examine their achievement of the four output targets and their contribution towards regional achievement of national priorities. It will also take into account their broader contribution to improving regional economic performance. Some of the RDAs' funding for 2003–04 will be allocated on the basis of their performance next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When talking about large sums, it is easy to get lost in the generality; it is only when we look at specifics that activities come alive. I will give some concrete examples of RDA achievements, which all relate to support for the manufacturing industry—a vital part of the RDAs' role and one that the Department of Trade and Industry takes very seriously. With my Department's help, each RDA will set up a regional manufacturing centre of excellence to provide tailored advice to manufacturing firms in its region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One North East has set up a new science and industry council, headed by the respected industrialist
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
Sir Ian Gibson, which brings together representatives of industry and academic institutions to ensure that the providers meet the needs of firms in the region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In south Yorkshire, Yorkshire Forward is supporting a new 100-acre advanced manufacturing park. The site will include the aerospace manufacturing research centre—an exciting joint venture between Boeing and Sheffield university. Other key tenants will include the new national metals centre of excellence, Corus and Castings Technology International.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The South West of England RDA is providing vital support to the world-leading Campden and Chorleywood Food Research Association, providing more than £270,000 of support, which will fund work in baking and cereals technology in support of the regional economy in the key priority sector of food and drink.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Advantage West Midlands and its partners intend to make the west midlands into a manufacturing beacon. Three weeks ago, it held a "Manufacturing Matters" summit attended by 180 companies. Workshops helped participants learn about and share best practice in a variety of subject areas. Advantage West Midlands is also establishing a think tank, building on the work of the Rover taskforce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The East of England Development Agency is giving funding to the east of England better regulation group to study the impact of regulation on small and medium enterprises in the manufacturing sector in that region in order to determine what support small firms want from regulators, to identify good regulatory practice, and to develop information and support material for manufacturing companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am struck by the variety of those examples. RDAs increasingly develop activities and solutions to problems that make sense in the context of their regions. We should applaud such diversity. It is exactly what we expected when we devised the single pot, and I will look keenly for evidence of further excellence and innovation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall draw this somewhat Castroesque speech to a close.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is unfair to Castro.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
RDAs are increasingly effective. They are supported by bodies such as the Confederation of British Industry, the Trades Union Congress, and the chambers of commerce, as well as most people who are genuinely interested in balanced and effective regional development in England. The role of RDAs is increasingly well understood by regional stakeholders, who have provided effective input to the regional economic strategies guiding their activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new single pot budget arrangements represent a significant opportunity for RDAs, and a significant challenge. Their achievements to date justify the faith that we place in them by enhancing their role. We now look to them to fulfil their promise and make a sustainable improvement in the economic prospects of

Members to ask questions of the Minister for up to one hour from the beginning of his statement, which is until one minute past 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I thank the Minister for letting me have an advance copy of his Havana address. That was helpful and courteous. A large part of the RDAs' work was previously done by the Government offices for the regions and English Partnerships. What is the value added by the RDAs? What are they doing that was not already being done by those two organisations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Theirs is a co-ordinating role. They have set an economic strategy and are involving all the partners. The Government offices for the regions are the Government's eyes and ears in the regions; they do not aim particularly to bring together different strands. English Partnerships, which is currently undergoing the quaintly named quinquennial review by the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, has a much more focused and defined role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The RDAs' role—as we found in the cases of Scotland and Wales—cannot be replicated by something provided centrally by the Government or by a national organisation with a local office. The RDAs work from the bottom up. The point is to allow people in the region to choose their priorities and to decide how to attract match funding to achieve those priorities. That cannot be undertaken by the other bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the work of the Government offices is being transferred to RDAs. For example, regional selective assistance applications of up to £2 million will from 1 April be dealt with by RDAs. That was part of the Department of Trade and Industry review. Once they have seen the RDAs in action, the work of many other Departments will become much less centralised. I think that RDAs' value-added capability has been proved in the past couple of years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Louise Ellman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, Riverside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give us an intimation of what his Department is doing to combat the threat to the important business development work of the RDAs coming from the European Commission's Competition Commissioner on the state aid issue? Does he agree that it is essential that the Government focus on the issue and ensure that that ruling does not contradict the efforts to develop the region made by the Regional Policy Commissioner?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point, which I have heard raised not just in relation to the north west but about the west midlands and other RDA areas. We are considering the matter. There is no immediate and obvious reason why that recent interference should have been made and such concerns raised. I have heard that the state aid rules are being applied more stringently, but that does not affect some regions. However, there is a genuine
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
problem, and I assure my hon. Friend that we are taking steps to sort it out, because as she rightly says, it is seriously affecting the RDAs' role and their opportunities to deliver their regional strategies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I think that the Committee should not be meeting, now that it is, it would be best to ask the Minister a few questions. First, may I welcome him? It gives me great pleasure to have the opportunity to question him for the next hour. I hope that he enjoys the experience as much as we who ask the questions will. I think that it would be best to ask a few questions at a time, and not to confuse matters with lengthy interventions. I am going to set a record of short questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, is it the Government's intention to get rid of the Government office for the south-west and replace it with the RDA, so that we end up with one body rather than two? Secondly, on the word "region", it is difficult to understand where the south-west region is. Does it start at Swindon? Does it extend to Bournemouth? Does it end in Penzance? It probably does, but there is a lack of clarity about what the region is. I should be grateful if the Minister could help us on those questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether we are working to Parkinson's law. As I understand it, the questions do not have to run for an hour if hon. Members do not want to ask any.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said up to an hour from the beginning of the statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made a Minister's clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to the first question is no. It is not our intention to get rid of that Government office. In fact, Government offices come under the Cabinet Office, and they were developed on entirely proper lines during the previous Administration. Instead of Government offices being the mouthpiece of one particular Department, which used to be the case, the Department for Education and Skills and the Department of Trade and Industry—indeed, all Government Departments—play a role in them. There are no plans to abolish any of the Government offices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where does the south-west region start and finish? It finishes at Penzance—that is one definite answer that I can give. I believe that it starts around Swindon, but the hon. Gentleman knows full well where the RDA in the south-west is located. There has been some controversy about that, but controversy is not confined to the RDA. All regional bodies in the south-west have experienced problems because they are in such a disparate region that stretches over a wide area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>John Mann 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bassetlaw)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two questions for the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Could we establish that the hon. Member for Totnes slipped in two questions? Hon. Members should ask one question at a time, although they may be called more than once.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>John Mann</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall ask one question.

The coalfield programme resides with English Partnerships. Should it not reside with the regional development agencies, and when should that happen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that that is part of the quinquennial review of the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions. Indeed, I think that the Department recently concluded that it is examining those precise questions. I cannot answer my hon. Friend's question today, but the results of the review will be published shortly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Andrew George 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(St. Ives)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the Minister afforded the hon. Member for Eastbourne the courtesy of providing him with an advance copy of his speech, but I am sorry that he did not afford me the same courtesy. It is important that the Liberal Democrats, as the effective Opposition, receive such information before the Committee meets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to follow up on the good question asked by the hon. Member for Eastbourne. Will the Minister clarify the effectiveness of the organisations that the RDAs replaced? Many people want to know the ways in which those organisations were failing. For example, the Rural Development Commission had a good track record. What did it fail to do that the RDAs are now doing? Which of the tasks successfully performed by the RDC have been effectively carried over to the RDAs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that there is a contest about which party is the official Opposition, and I am sure that it will continue for years to come. I followed the protocol, but I have no problem with releasing my speech. I promise to send a copy of my speech to the Liberal Democrats when the Regional Affairs Committee next meets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's questions were probably more appropriate following the publication of the Millan report—we debated the issue in 1998. Millan conducted a lengthy and vigorous analysis and said that too many organisations were going in different directions. Although many such organisations have continued to operate—RDAs have not taken over the world; far from it—a co-ordinating body was needed, and that role can be better achieved through the RDAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure which tasks the RDAs took over from the Rural Development Commission. However, I know that all RDAs have a clear focus on rural issues—that is part of their central drive. We hear criticism from urban areas that we pay too much attention to rural areas. That actually means that we have got the focus just about right. However, I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a more detailed answer without going back through the Millan report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ellman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that the work that was done by several county councils during the 1980s on setting up enterprise boards shows the importance of a development agency that can work with business and the voluntary sector—as well as with the public sector—and invest in the economy? Lancashire Enterprises, of which I was vice-chairman, worked with the private sector to rescue
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
Leyland Trucks by investing in the company, and purchasing the site and developing it as a key manufacturing area for the entire north-west. Does the Minister agree that that is a good example of the work that regional development agencies can do— although, in that case, it was done by Lancashire Enterprises, which was county council based?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has raised an important point, and I am happy to pay tribute to Lancashire Enterprises, and to all of the work that it did in respect of Leyland in Preston.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also the case that in unitary authorities, economic development agencies at local level showed the need to co-ordinate such work. Outside of some county councils, the absence was at a regional level, and the regional development agencies are built on the kind of work that was done by Lancashire Enterprises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister claims that, by establishing regional development agencies, the Government are allowing a bottom-up approach, rather than a top-down one. Many of the strategies that I have seen seem to be concerned about co-ordination with the Government's intention. Will the Minister answer the question about the ability of the regional development agencies in recent years to respond to some problems in their areas? I am thinking particularly of transport problems, especially those of the rail services, and of RDAs' failure to take a proactive role in bringing partners together to address what are clearly regional strategic transport problems—according to the Government's definition of "regional".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said in my statement, it must be borne in mind that, for the first two and a half years, the regional development agencies have been administering 11 funds that were pre-set by the Government: 92 per cent. of their funding is land and properties, and single regeneration budget money. That was pre-determined; there was little flexibility within their budget. Nevertheless, within those constraints, they have reacted remarkably well to local challenges, and I gave some examples of that in my statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Transport is an interesting case. The RDAs say that now that they have a track record of sorts, they are moving into the single budget. They have frustrations with regard to matters such as transport, which is a key issue in every region. However, we want to ensure that they do not bite off more than they can chew. Therefore, part of what we are saying to them is, "Look, here is the single pot, which is a step forward. Over the next two years you will be handling that, and administering the RSA and other things that add up to a value of up to £2 million. But issues such as transport, where there is a clear national strategy and priority, are different." It is understandable that the RDAs get frustrated about that, because they cannot have much influence over their own destiny in such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us see how we take the process forward. It would be wrong if the regional development agencies were to bite off more than they could chew. At their meeting with the Prime Minister a couple of weeks
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0593">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
ago, transport was the major concern: they need more ability to co-ordinate the Highways Agency and other organisations, to ensure that transport is an effective part of their strategy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>John Mann</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although over the past 18 months my constituency has had the most job losses of any constituency, with more than 4,500 redundancies, the latest statistics show that over the past 12 months unemployment has gone down by 61. That position has been consistent over the past six months. Several initiatives from the East Midland Development Agency have contributed to that: the sub-regional partnership, which is one of the first to be private-sector led; the Shireoaks Triangle development, which is about to be opened, and which will provide a significant number of jobs next month; the Worksop housing development, which, significantly, is backed by ENDA and is due to be launched next month; and the Worksop Town football club development. That club was formed in 1861, and is the fourth oldest in the country. It has announced a proposed move to a new ground with a major new sports development, which will be the biggest in non-league football. That, too, has been backed by ENDA. Which of those major RDA and Government successes does the Minister feel it appropriate for me to invite him to open? Which Ministers does he recommend for the others?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all enjoyed that tour of Bassetlaw. I had the pleasure of going there just before the last general election. I shall plump for Worksop Town.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes said, this debate puts the cart before the horse because we await the White Paper on regional government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to press the Minister on the developing relationship between RDAs and regional chambers and assemblies. Leaving aside the political placement that the Government may have put on RDAs, some agencies include high-powered businessmen; for example, Allan Willett is the distinguished first head of SEEDA, and has a business with a successful track record. Such businessmen will not be comfortable about being second or third-guessed by local councillors who sit on a regional body. They are used to driving through schemes, making profits and wealth, running companies and creating jobs without spending much time talking about it. Would the Minister like to comment on the potential tension between what the Government are trying to achieve, and getting the right people to stay in RDAs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would, because that question sums up a misunderstanding by Conservative Members—we may have put political point-scoring to one side, but could yet have a little more. The Conservative party is the only political party that does not back RDAs; indeed, one of its previous manifesto commitments was to abolish them. I should like a consensus on the issue, as would people such as Allan Willett, who wants to work with Members of Parliament. Many Conservative activists, too, are fully participating in RDAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
The official Opposition confuse decentralisation with devolution. We are not having a cart-before-the-horse debate. RDAs will continue because they are a permanent part of the structure. The White Paper that we await from the Cabinet Office relates to English devolution, not to replacing RDAs. I need to say that because, during an Adjournment debate, a Conservative Member said that RDAs were soon to be replaced by regional assemblies—they are not. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is related to today's debate, and to the comment about the cart before the horse from the hon. Member for Eastbourne. RDAs are a permanent part of the landscape of economic development, and that point is relevant to the issue of regional chambers and assemblies. Our manifesto policy was that, where there were by-and-large unitary authorities, further devolution for English regions could follow subject to a referendum of the people of the region. If there is no appetite for that, or a referendum result opposes it, RDAs will continue on the basis on which they operate now, which is that democratic input comes from the regional chamber's regional assemblies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eastbourne says that business people want to move things along quickly. I agree, and I know of no tensions between regional assemblies and RDAs—apart from one minor example—that have led to a project being held up. They have good relationships. The regional assembly in the south-west was given a scrutiny role, which is important because £1.7 billion of public money goes to the RDAs; that is taxpayers' money. We set central targets and outputs, but the RDAs have a lot of freedom in deciding how to spend that money, particularly after 1 April and the single pot. It would be perverse if there were no democratic accountability in the process from elected representatives. We do not want to hold things up or to impose additional bureaucracy; we want proper scrutiny of what the RDAs are doing. I have dealt with the matter since June, and I have not heard a single business person on an RDA board or an RDA chairman say that significant tension is preventing them from moving forward with their agenda.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ellman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that the decision to make the Department of Trade and Industry the lead Department for the RDAs has caused concern in some quarters that RDAs may ignore environmentally sustainable development and consider the interests of regeneration as being less important?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right; there may have been fears at the time. All the RDAs and people associated with them were keen to come under the DTI umbrella, but that does not mean that they wanted to diminish or dilute the sustainable development part of their programmes. The RDAs can sum up their mission in five words: socially inclusive, sustainable, economic development. The RDA chairmen report every six weeks to a meeting of Ministers, including those from the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Under the single pot, they have four main targets, one of which concerns the amount of brownfield land they regenerate. Sustainable

development is important and remains part of their work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I was the Member of Parliament for Liverpool, Wavertree under the Wilson Government, we had many initiatives on urban problems. Then, we had the Tories' urban studies and partnerships chaired by Ministers; now, we have RDAs and Ministers chairing them. However, the problems remain roughly the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George) referred to transport and, having moved from Liverpool, Wavertree to south Devon, my problem is that it is not being addressed. It was raised coherently, but not specifically by the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two railway lines from Exeter to Penzance. They take a scenic route along the coast between Exeter and Newton Abbot, with wonderful views over the sea. The only snag is that the sea is coming in. Railtrack—or whatever it is called now— keeps saying that it can keep the sea out, but it has a King Canute attitude. The sea keeps coming in at Dawlish—100,000 tonnes of rock has already fallen from the cliff—and every so often the track is closed. The time will come when there will be no railway line from Dawlish to Penzance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not complaining about the road or airport system, which is common throughout the country. Will the Minister ask the RDA to focus on the fact that an alternative route must be found to enable the railway line to bypass Dawlish? Otherwise, the sea will come in, as it did at Slapton sands where it destroyed the road, and it will destroy the railway. There will be no rail track between Dawlish, Exeter, Plymouth and Penzance, and something needs to be done to focus on that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has raised his point effectively. I was on holiday in Dawlish last year, and I know what he is talking about. I am sure that the RDAs will pore over every word said during this debate, and I shall certainly make sure that they focus on that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ellman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To what extent does the Minister think the RDAs are dealing with the skills gap? Is he aware that a recent report, "Productivity in the UK: the Regional Dimension", published by the Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry, cited the skills gap as a main reason for economic disparities among the regions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm that the skills gap was cited as one of the major reasons for economic disparities. All RDAs have the same focus because problems such as transport, which we have mentioned, skills and planning are common to them all. I can write to my hon. Friend to indicate the various initiatives that have been taken, but the learning and skills councils are very new. They were introduced last April and are coming up to their first anniversary. The important priority at the moment is to establish a relationship among the learning and skills councils, the RDAs and other stakeholders. As I understand the situation—it is not my Department—the DFES is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
moving on to another phase to try to resolve the skills problems. The RDAs placed skills training at the top of their agendas both before and after the creation of the learning and skills councils. I shall write to my hon. Friend with the details of the many initiatives that they have taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister rightly pointed out the complexity of both agencies and funds, and the difficulties with which local partners have to grapple in bringing forward successful economic development schemes. I draw his attention to two parliamentary questions that I put to the Cabinet Office, which were answered on 25 February. I asked how many Government agencies, non-departmental public bodies and others there were across all sectors, what their budgets were and for that information to be broken down by region. I tabled two questions of that nature, both of which were answered with:
	<br><q><p>"This information is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost."— [	<i>Official Report,</i> 25 February 2002; Vol. 380, c. 876W.]</p></q>
That worries me, and I want to ask the Minister an unanswered question. If the Government have not got a handle on the extent of the complexity of agencies, agencies' budgets and how agencies interrelate to one another, how can they expect local partners on the ground, who these days are expected to have a PhD in understanding how that complex system works, to bring forward their proposals when those partners have to double guess how the whole system operates? What will the Government do to break that problem down?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that it is very confusing for local people. There are many non-departmental public bodies and there are also many voluntary bodies. There are many organisations on the same patch, which can make things rather difficult. The RDAs have a role to play in that. The Confederation of British Industry tried to put all the different elements of support on to a chart, but it gave up because the diagram got very busy. The RDAs have a role as the principal, first stopping-off point. If there were a problem in my region and I needed to access funds, business support and best practice, I would go to the RDA first. It might pass me on to another body because it would not want to duplicate that body's work or because that body's role fell outside its specific responsibilities. It would, however, have a role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman received that reply from the Cabinet Office, but, thinking about my region, the issue is complex. Perhaps we can make it less complex through the RDAs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that the Minister has agreed to ask the RDA to review the Dawlish problem carefully. If a major aim is economic development, he should also draw the transport system to the RDA's attention. My concern is that the south-west will not develop as a major region if it does not have an efficient and effective transport system. It is a transport backwater. It has an airport at Plymouth, which is on the edge of Dartmoor. If one buys a ticket for Plymouth, one ends up in Newquay, Cornwall. It is like buying a ticket at Paddington to go to Plymouth but ending up on the bus. I am waiting for a time when
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0595">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
one can buy a ticket for the bus and end up on the train.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A region's economic growth will be determined by its transport system. If rail is not reliable and planes that are supposed to land elsewhere end up in Newquay—not that often, according to the Minister—that leaves only travel by road. Beyond Exeter, the road is not a motorway, and there are no motorways in Cornwall, although there are some dual carriageways. The region's economic growth depends on real investment in the infrastructure. Will the RDA make recommendations on how economic development is affected by the lack of transport infrastructure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not one of the specific roles of RDAs, which is why they made their concern clear a couple of weeks ago. However, such issues are bound to be raised when RDAs draw up regional economic strategies with stakeholders and develop corporate plans with local people. Whether they are used to influence the 10-year transport plan—other Government Departments meet the RDAs on a regular basis—is another issue. The fact that transport is not ostensibly part of the four targets that we have set under the single pot does not mean that RDAs cannot lobby for transport in their regions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister drew attention to the new criteria by which RDAs will be judged under the single budget for the next financial year. The most important aim is to promote economic development and regionally balanced growth. I understand that the prime measure of that will be the trend of growth, or otherwise, in gross domestic product per capita, and that the fundamental aim in setting up RDAs was to make regions that had been falling behind more competitive. In the light of that, why do each of the regions have targets for managing growth rather than increasing it further, but the south-east and London do not? Their growth is putting other regions at a disadvantage. If that is the measure, why did the January European GDP report show that GDP had dropped by 2 per cent. from 67 to 65 per cent. below the European average in Cornwall?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a difficult question. The problems of the south-east and London are different from those of other regions, but that does not mean that parts of them do not need attention. For example, Thanet and Hastings in the south-east need to be brought up to the level of the rest of the region—that is what much of the work is about—and, in London, some parts have been terribly blighted by population changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I will write to all hon. Members about the issue. The GDP part will be a consequence of what we hope the RDAs achieve. The principal targets involve restoring hectares of brownfield land to use, creating or protecting jobs, supporting learning opportunities and developing new businesses. We set those real and palpable targets under the single pot budget arrangements, and the growth in GDP should be a natural consequence. In Scotland, the success was remarkable under the targets set by the Government under Edward Heath. I am not absolutely sure, but I believe that Scotland's GDP rose from the seventh
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
highest in the whole of the United Kingdom to the fourth highest. At any rate, there has certainly been measured success. However, that is not a central part of the targets that we are setting, but is a consequence of their success in other areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ellman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that successful regional economic development depends greatly on good planning decisions at a regional level, for example in housing development and land use? Does he agree that a directly elected regional assembly would ensure that such decisions that are taken regionally have legitimacy and are democratically accountable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend's first question. Planning is central. She will excuse me if I do not get into a discussion about the White Paper that will shortly be published, as I am sure that there will be enough debate on it then. I believe that that will be in the spring, which, in political terms, can run anywhere between April and December.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to move on to sustainable development, which the Minister tells us is one of the RDAs' objectives. I do not know who coined the phrase, but I have a feeling that we should pay tribute to the Liberal Democrats, as it has become meaningless. It fits well with their ideology to use such weasel words that mean nothing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand what sustainable development means in relation to RDAs. Will the Minister elucidate? Is it sustainable to build what I believe are 357,000 new homes when the transport system does not quite work, sewers overflow and there are insufficient school places? There will be mayhem in the south-west if another 357,000 homes are built.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not responsible for coining the phrase, and I do not know who was. However, it is important. The sort of development that occurred in the 1950s and 1960s paid no attention to the damage to the environment or to the beauty of the landscape. Sustainable development takes into account that economic development is necessary, but that it must not be environmentally damaging. That is the most common use of the term, and the RDAs must bear that in mind. I do not recognise a use of the term that means that one cannot sustain a housing estate in the south-west because of its transport links.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Totnes should be more worried about the sustainability of his own party than about the ability of a politician of any party to define what we mean by the word. That is well recorded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To follow the eloquent question from the hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman), will the Minister say what guidance is being given to RDAs to ensure that they monitor their performance against sustainability indicators? I understand from a briefing from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds that RDAs should contribute to the strengthening of environment data held by the regional observatories. It must be possible for the RDAs to set up several indicators by which sustainability can be measured annually.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman does not mind, I shall take that away and write to him on it, because there are complexities. There was some conflict with the East of England Development Agency and the regional assembly about sustainable development. I think that mechanisms are in place, but I shall write to the hon. Gentleman to give him chapter and verse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. O'Hara, for allowing me to ask a question before the guillotine falls. It is on sustainable development. The Minister said that he did not think that road transport would be one of the issues, but if we build almost half a million new homes, that will double the amount of traffic on the roads and more people will want to use the railways, which may not exist in Cornwall. Does the Minister believe that those developments will include new school places or hospitals? What does sustainable development include? I have been reading the structure plan for Devon, which was produced by the Liberal Democrats, but it does not help us much. If one of the RDA's five objectives is sustainable development, what does that mean? I am not trying to ask a politically clever question; I am just trying to find an answer that nobody seems able to give.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I can answer it, either. I was saying not that road transport was not a factor, but that the hon. Gentleman's earlier example of a housing estate being unsustainable because of the road links did not fit with my definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be clear, the RDAs are not about building hospitals and schools; they are about economic development. I quoted the five-word mission statement, not the five targets, and I am saying that the RDAs should concentrate on economic development. Other bodies and groups concentrate on health care and education, and the RDAs must not be lured into areas that are not in their central remit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the matter of the progress of the Regional Development Agencies against their objectives.—[	<i>Alan Johnson.</i>]</p></q></p>
	<p>3.3 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that you, Mr. O'Hara, will not take it as a slight on your chairmanship and that the Minister will not take offence if I say that today has been a low-key affair. That is understandable, because regional development agencies do not set the pulse racing. We do not even have a full complement of the core members of the Committee, nor a single Member who is not a core member with the exception of myself and the Minister, who were invited to be here
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
by our respective Whips. There is a distinct lack of excitement in the air, and the Minister reflected that in the great majestic sweep of his opening statement. He noted that some people said that the new RDAs have done little that is radical in their early years, and I would agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the reason that there is not more excitement is because those on the Government Benches are deadpan about the subject? I am excited about the possibility of tackling RDAs on several points, but the flat feeling on the Government Benches seems to be causing some problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to disagree with my hon. Friend, but I think that that may be their normal expression, although it is not for me to speculate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend touched on this point in his question about Dawlish. When the RDAs were set up, there was the feeling in local government and business circles, certainly in my constituency, that we should give them a fair chance to prove themselves. Such attitudes are common in this country, because people believe in fair play. However, the litmus test for the success or failure of regional development agencies is whether they are significantly instrumental in achievements such as repairing the crumbling railway line at Dawlish or whether they are not and it falls into the sea, or whether the cause of that happening was down to another agency or central Government. I have not received one letter from a constituent complaining that he felt deprived because the regional bodies had not existed before. I do not know how many of my constituents even know that they are fortunate to have an RDA looking after their interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, nor whether my constituents know what the RDA is supposed to be doing for them. I do not want to get on to the subject of regional identity because, with the possible exception—which I conceded when I was shadow Minister for Local Government, as the hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside will know—of the north-east of England, there is little regional identity throughout the country, certainly not in my part of the world. People in Eastbourne have no desire to be run by someone based in Guildford.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ellman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that a national poll published today showed that at least 72 per cent. of the population in the north-west, north-east and Yorkshire want a directly elected regional assembly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what questions were asked, but as someone who began life as a Yorkshireman—one never ceases to be a Yorkshireman—if there were a region called Yorkshire, most Yorkshiremen would sign up to it. However, a Yorkshireman could not be persuaded to belong to a region that is larger and more amorphous than Yorkshire. I first thought that the hon. Lady was referring to the ICM poll that showed that the Government's lead had been cut in half.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to a bottom-up approach as if there were great support among ordinary people and small and medium-sized businesses for RDAs. I do not believe that most people know that they exist or what they are doing. No real interest has been shown in the subject. With all due respect to the sprinkling of people in the Public Gallery, the attendance here today does not contradict what I am saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to keep interrupting my hon. Friend, but I am sure that it will add to the quality and range of his speech if he deals with my question. One aim of the RDAs is to help small businesses. Does he agree that the best way in which to help small businesses is to lift the red tape that surrounds them, especially the rules and regulations that come from Europe? Successive Governments, including Conservative Governments, have said that they will do that, but they have failed. Should that not be one of the litmus tests for the RDAs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree very much with my hon. Friend. I am sure that he has detailed knowledge of the small businesses in his constituency. Only last Sunday, a report showed that an extra £3 billion burden had been placed on businesses under this Government, and that is unsustainable. I can see the sense in putting on RDAs go-getting business men and women who have run businesses successfully, but those people will be nothing but restive if they are controlled by bureaucrats or local politicians who second guess their actions. However, perhaps that debate will be more significant when the White Paper is produced in the spring this year, or some time during this Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only people who have a real regional agenda are members of the Government. The agenda has two midwives, one of which is devolution. Like so many Government policies that have not been thought through, after devolution in Scotland and Wales, it was decided to throw in the idea of English devolution—like a last-minute sop. The second midwife is European integration. We know that there are people in the Government and the Labour party— and some Liberal Democrats, if not all of them—who see this as a means of paving the way to a Europe of the regions. In a speech that was reported in the 	<i>Birmingham Post,</i> the former Minister for Europe, the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz), called for the regional development agencies to promote what he called "the positive message" about Europe. That is an interesting quote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, this is not entirely a bottom-up operation. It is a top-bottom operation. There is also an attempt to use the regional development agencies as a mechanism for getting across the Government's message on this, or anything else. If their policy has changed since November 2000, I am sure that the Minister will seek to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman develops that old chestnut further, would he like to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
present to the Committee any scraps of evidence that back up his conspiracy theory?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I used the word "conspiracy", but there is a tremendous closeness of view between the Liberal Democrats and the Government on this. It might assist the hon. Gentleman if I quote his colleague, the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster). He spoke to this Committee on 18 December last year, and he said:
	<br><q><p>"The Minister, his team and the Government share the view of Liberal Democrats that regional government is of vital importance for England. Its time has come".— [	<i>Official Report, Regional Affairs Committee,</i> 18 December 2001; c. 18.]</p></q>
I wish to link that with the Liberal Democrats' known enthusiasm for anything to do with Europe, which is about the only thing that all Liberal Democrats have in common. With regard to other matters, there are as many views on policy as there are Liberal Democrats, but all of them are great proponents of Europe. I am departing from the main theme of my speech, but the hon. Gentleman made an important intervention and I want to deal with it fully. The Liberal Democrats are also great supporters of anything that serves to undermine this place, which is why they are so enthusiastic about Europe and regional government. They are happy to sign up to anything that serves to undermine this place; that is a constant theme of their attitude to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman has provoked me, I shall say something else, in passing. One must keep an eye on such things on almost a day-to-day or hour-to-hour basis, but I think that it is still Liberal Democrat policy to give tax powers to regional assemblies, so that there would be a regional tax on top of existing national and local taxes. If the hon. Gentleman wants to contradict me on that, I am happy to give way again. Obviously, he does not wish to contradict me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me return to my main point. In a nutshell, we see the RDAs as part of the regional agenda. In fairness, the Minister agrees with that, because he used that phrase more than once in his speech. The RDAs and regional assemblies are a kind of Trojan horse for the development of a Europe of the regions. However, they are also having unintended consequences—the Government are masters of the law of unintended consequences. There are rising tensions over funding differences between Scotland and the north of England, for example, and voices are being raised against the Barnett formula. Such tensions are direct consequences of the Government's policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to what I call the competition aspect, which was touched on in one of the questions that the hon. Member for St. Ives asked. Every so-called "region" of the country has its own regional development agency. That includes Cornwall, which, on any view, is well behind the European average on all the usual indicators; but it also includes London and the south-east, as the Minister conceded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I met my local SEEDA representatives—because I am not one of those churlish people who does not do such things—and they are determined to make the south-east the most successful region in Europe. That is fine; if one has a background in business, it is right to have a clear, focused idea of where one is going.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0598">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
However, how does that aspiration sit with those regions that are already a long way behind? The south-east has areas of poverty and pockets of high unemployment, although some people might find that difficult to grasp. However, as a region—it is insisted that we consider these places as regions—its economic performance is way ahead of Cornwall's. How on earth is somewhere such as Cornwall to be pulled back up to the European average? Serious questions and tensions surround the Government's various aims for the RDAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to examine the Trade and Industry Committee's report of May 2001. The Committee examined several regions, and concluded that the north-east was a coherent region with a strong regional identity—I have always agreed with that. However, with life being what it is, there is always a cloud with every silver lining. The report said:
	<br><q><p>"This produced higher initial expectations of the RDA than could, at least initially, be met."</p></q>
The report said that the east midlands is
	<br><q><p>"an awkward mixture of town and country".</p></q>
It said that the south-west had identity problems, which we have heard from at least two hon. Members. The report also mentioned the reservations of bodies such as the British Chambers of Commerce on the aims and ambitions of the RDAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go into great detail today, but the report also mentioned relationships between Government offices and RDAs, which were found to be generally good but with the potential for tension and a blurring of boundaries. An interesting performance and innovation unit report also bears some of that out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Events surrounding the north-west regional assembly are perhaps the most dramatic recent example—the Minister tried to dismiss it during one of his answers—of enormous potential implications for long-term relationships between RDAs and new so-called democratic structures, on which the White Paper will touch, and the effect on the business community's confidence in RDAs. The Confederation of British Industry and other private sector groups effectively walked out of the assembly. Business leaders said that the assembly had
	<br><q><p>"failed to take private sector concerns into account, and created another layer of government rather than drawing on a wide spectrum of support."</p></q>
They said that
	<br><q><p>"the running of the assembly fell well short of standards of corporate governance expected in the private sector … Private sector disenchantment is not confined to the North-West".</p></q>
Mr. Collinson, who is their spokesman, said:
	<br><q><p>"The North-East has also totally ignored the private sector, and other regions are complaining."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ellman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the reason the CBI gave for its action was that it did not consider that the individuals who then ran the assembly properly listened to what it said? Since the CBI's decision, it has stated in writing that it supports regional devolution. Does the hon. Gentleman join me
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
in hoping that there are ways in which it can be involved with the assembly? Does he agree that if we had directly elected assemblies, accountability would be clearer and the private sector's role could be incorporated more effectively?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree to the extent that if the Government are determined to blunder on with the policy, it is important to find mechanisms that keep the business community involved, happy and enthusiastic. The example that I quoted shows that that has not worked so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made this point with several different emphases: there is an inherent potential tension between people with a business background and people with a local authority background. It is all too true that fewer and fewer people in local government have a business background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the make-up of RDAs, House of Commons Library research concludes that the Government have packed RDA boards with Labour supporters. Almost three quarters of members with a known political affiliation had links to either the Labour party or trade unions. There are almost five times as many Labour members of RDAs as Conservatives. That is wholly out of kilter with the relative strengths of local government—even more so since the Conservative party stormed ahead to make widespread gains in the local government elections. [	<i>Laughter.</i>] Labour Members may laugh, but that is the truth. The Conservatives are well on their way to becoming the first party of local government again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his response, I hope that the Minister will try to allay fears about the political background of people on RDAs—those who are there because of a political connection—and the underlying tension between local authority-appointed people and those with a business background. There are real questions about the future relationship between the RDAs and the new regional structures that we will shortly hear about, and it is clear that bodies such as the CBI have major reservations. There will be massive implications, especially for businesses, because it is proposed that the planning system be up-ended so that local people have less of a say than they have at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are clear in our policy. We oppose regional chambers and assemblies, which will impose an extra layer of government, expense and bureaucracy between the existing ones of local and central Government. We shall follow closely the White Paper and the Government's future proposals for carrying forward RDAs, and review their roles and functions in a root-and-branch way under the next Conservative Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has already said what was in our last manifesto, and it will be a long time before we prepare our next one. Our hostility to any form of regional structure, including RDAs, is well known.

	<p>3.22 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ellman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome this opportunity to debate the work of regional development agencies. We should recognise that they are new organisations—they have operated for less than three years—and that they work in innovative ways. The Government should be praised for setting them up. In doing so, they recognised the need to find new ways to tackle regional disparities and ensure that the needs of all regions are met in a way that satisfied the people in those regions—different answers for different places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the recommendations of the Millan commission were followed, and should register an interest in that I was a member of that commission. The points that it made have been well taken by the Government and I am pleased that they set up the RDAs. It is true that, because the RDAs are the creatures of the Government, set up by and accountable to the Government, they are not always seen to be accountable to the regions in which they work. However, because of Government guidance, the RDAs must consult with the regional assemblies and chambers—an important requirement. The North West Development Agency has consulted with the regional assembly and established an ongoing dialogue. It would be better if the regional assembly were directly elected—it would become more focused and accountable itself—but in the absence of that, the guidance given to the RDA to consult and liaise with the assembly is appropriate and welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we examine the effectiveness of the RDAs, we should look at the context in which they operate. I praise the Government for giving RDAs more flexibility in funding and in their ability to spend in accordance with the priorities of their regions in the past three years. We now have a single pot. That is helpful, and I hope that the Minister can say that the Government will give RDAs more flexibility in future, so that they can work appropriately in their regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also important to recognise that although RDAs have welcome and necessary Government backing, it is not always clear what impact the needs of the regions, as expressed through the RDAs, have on other spending Departments. The Minister explained that RDAs' budgets were—I think that I recall—some £1.5 billion. That money is a great advance on what they had before, but if we compare it with what is spent in public service Departments, and indeed in the major research councils, it does not appear as large as it did initially. It is important to ensure that the requirements of the regions identified by the RDAs are met by the actions of central Government, be it through their spending Departments, their investment decisions, or what is happening in the important research councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that the RDAs were asked to draw up regional economic strategies is of great importance. It was the first time that some regions had drawn up such strategies, but not the north-west. In the early 1990s, the leaders of major local authorities came together to form the North-West Regional Association. Following that, they worked with the private and voluntary sectors under the North-West Partnership to draw up a regional strategy. Much of the work taking place in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
the north-west is drawn from what was set up in the early 1990s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The circumstances are different in other regions; for them, the requirement for a regional economic strategy came about with the advent of the RDAs. Whatever strategies are drawn up, the effectiveness of an RDA must be judged by its actions. Strategies matter, but actions are most important. We should make a distinction between how effective RDAs are as partners in activities that may have begun earlier— for example, developing the single regeneration budgets—and what innovative action they are taking on truly regional issues, such as the setting up of regional venture capital funds. That is extremely important, and can only be done effectively regionally, because the size of the fund is important in making it effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that investment through venture capital is linked to the giving of proper advice. I am aware that venture capital funds have been set up quite effectively in smaller areas. I shall draw on my involvement in Lancashire in the early 1990s. Lancashire Enterprises set up the rosebud fund to invest in very small businesses and give support to people who had few resources. By working with investment institutions, that developed into the setting-up of a broader regional fund to invest in business. I foresee that those developing regional venture capital funds will draw on the experiences of Lancashire and elsewhere. West Yorkshire enterprise board was involved in similar activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention venture capital funds as an example of a new initiative that has an impact across a region. I recognise the contribution that the North West Development Agency has made to the north-west by showing that, although some initiatives are truly regional, part of a regional perspective is highlighting the contribution that different parts of the region can make to the whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I particularly applaud the activities of the North West Development Agency in setting up and running the regeneration company Liverpool Vision—which, again, was instigated by the Government—to develop Liverpool's city centre as an engine of growth for not only Liverpool, but the whole of Merseyside. The NWDA works well as a very active partner in Liverpool Vision, which will, however, be judged by its results. I hope that in the near future we will be able to see in practical terms some of the development and planning work that it has been doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to focus on two areas of particular significance to the north-west in general and to Liverpool in particular in which the role of the North West Development Agency is extremely important. I disagree with the comments made by the hon. Member for Eastbourne, who felt that the work of RDAs was not exciting. The two areas to which I will refer are extremely important, if not exciting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The north-west is a centre of excellence in manufacturing and as a skills base, but it is under threat because of problems in its industrial sector. I am referring to the future of Marconi, which is important
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0600">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
for the north-west in general and vital to Liverpool and Merseyside in particular. Marconi is known as a company that has produced excellent products and developed excellent technology. The telecommunications sector in this country, and indeed internationally, is, however, facing considerable difficulties. As a result of those difficulties, the 2,200-strong work force who were at Marconi in Liverpool one year ago find that their number is about to be halved by the series of job reductions that have taken place over the past year. Indeed, it was about one year ago that the trade unions involved alerted Members of Parliament to those difficulties when they came to the House of Commons and expressed their concerns and their wish to work with the company, Members of Parliament and others to retain whatever was possible in Liverpool. Since that time, Marconi has taken its decisions as a company, and the work force in Liverpool are about to be halved in number.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NWDA was brought into Liverpool and asked to consider what it would do to support telecommunications, and Marconi in particular. When the repercussion of a major international decision was the announcement of more redundancies in Liverpool, it discussed the matter with local universities to look at how many new products could be developed and how skills could be retained. At the moment, it is working with Marconi, in co-operation with the trade unions and indeed the Government, in considering the possibility of developing broadband as a new interactive network of vital importance to our economy, our businesses and our public services. It is examining how quicker and more effective development of broadband could go ahead, which would bring more manufacturing and employment opportunities to Marconi in Liverpool.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have set their targets for broadband, stating that the United Kingdom should become
	<br><q><p>"the most extensive and competitive market for broadband in the G7 by 2005".</p></q>
The current position is a 1 per cent. take-up of broadband. We have a long way to go and I hope that the Government will act. At the moment, the NWDA is talking to Marconi and working with local industries and universities to see how take-up can be improved. It is able to do that because the Government have allocated it about £2.5 million of funds for that purpose. The agency is also working with the company and universities to consider how European Union funding can be accessed in order to further development.

I recognise the work of the NWDA; it is vital to manufacturing and telecommunications on Merseyside and in the north-west. Can the Minister offer more support to the development of broadband? In helping our economy to become more competitive, he should consider the regional dimension and the impact of manufacturing and telecommunications on the north-west, and on Liverpool in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
The second area is very exciting, and has been identified in the NWDA strategy. It is building on the region's excellence in universities and companies to develop particularly our science base for the benefit of the economy and business, and to allow skills to remain in, and be attracted to, the region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Daresbury lost Diamond Synchrotron's massive investment to Oxfordshire in the south-east, the shock galvanised the north-west into action in which the NWDA was an active participant. The loss of that major scientific investment through a national decision happened at a time at which 20 times as much Government research and development money was being invested in the south-east as in the north-west. The plain fact is that the north-west needs £1 billion a year more investment in research and development to achieve parity with the south-east.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At any one of the higher education institutions in London—for example, at University College London or Imperial College—and at Oxford or Cambridge, investment in research and development is more than that at all higher education institutions in the north-west put together. If that is not an indication of a north-south divide, I do not know what is. Against that background, the loss of the Diamond Synchrotron investment came as a massive blow, but one that galvanised the north-west to become more aware of the disparity of investment in a vital area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have asked myself whether the situation would have got to the point at which calamity struck had we had an elected assembly. One consequence of what happened is that the north-west is now working together as a region to bring more investment into our science base and build on excellence. Universities, businesses, Members of Parliament, local authorities, and the voluntary and health sectors have been brought together largely through the work of the development agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two key projects are in prospect to ensure that the north-west takes its proper national position as a centre of excellence for science, and to use our science base to develop jobs and a sound economy for the whole region. The first relates to developments in accelerator science. In the next few days, major decisions will be taken by one of the major research councils on the future of the proposed CASIM—the Centre for Accelerator Science, Imaging and Medicine—project. It is proposed to be located at the Daresbury laboratory, and to be linked with the excellent work being done at Liverpool university and elsewhere. That work consists of several parts, including development of a fourth-generation light source, Sirius, medical imaging and essential work on diagnosis and prevention of cancer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The peer review of the CASIM project undertaken by 200 national and international scientists produced an excellent report, from which I shall quote one comment. An international scientist stated:
	<br><q><p>"This is an outstanding scientific proposal, of the type that arises every decade or so. It has significant potential to enhance Britain's international standing in this broad area of work."</p></q>
That is one example from the peer review of the project and I understand that a report will go to the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
appropriate research council on 28 March, which is very soon. The role of the North West Development Agency as a champion of the scheme and following it through is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other major initiative in the north-west is development of the area and Liverpool university in particular as a centre of excellence for e-science. Liverpool university is already highly rated for its science and has received two major national awards during the past year as a centre of excellence. It is now developing a proposal to become a national e-science centre and is working with the North West Development Agency and the Government to achieve that. The ideas in the proposal are breathtaking. They include working with business to improve productivity and competitiveness, and a link between the World Health Organisation and the world-renowned Liverpool school of tropical medicine to develop a major initiative on disease control. The initiatives spring from local knowledge and enthusiasm, but they need a regional champion to bring them together and to ensure that they succeed. The North West Development Agency is playing a much needed role in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In assessing the work of the RDAs, three years is too short a period in which to judge whether they will be permanently successful, but it is sufficient to see the impact of their role. Every region will assess its own regional development agency. I applaud the support that the North West Development Agency has given to business with more investment. I applaud the way in which it has linked different parts of the region so that they develop their own excellence as part of a regional whole. I applaud the way in which it acts as a regional champion. I am disappointed that so little is known outside the confines of the RDA about its work. RDAs would be more effective if they were seen to belong to their regions and to be accountable to an elected body. More people would know what they are doing and could champion their work to make the public aware of what is happening, and they would have the necessary legitimacy when they go to the Government, the European Union and wherever else they are required to make representations in pursuance of excellence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to Lord Thomas of Macclesfield for his work over three years in chairing the North West Development Agency. He has been an excellent exponent for regional development and showing how the public and private sectors can work together. I am sure that Brian Grey will be an admirable successor and I hope that he will follow in the footsteps of Lord Thomas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regional development agencies deserve support. They were set up by the Government, and I hope that the Minister will continue to support them and that not only his Department but other Departments link in with what the regional development agencies are saying, respond to their requests and work together to give all regions a fair deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
progress of regional development agencies against their objectives. She gave some good examples of projects in her region that are succeeding. The question is whether projects in the north-west—or anywhere else—would be more successful with or without the RDAs. As she rightly said, after only three years, it is too early to assess their development properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the Committee is to compare the progress of RDAs with their objectives. I was disappointed that we did not receive any background information or reports that we could use to judge their progress. Searching in the Commons Library and elsewhere failed to produce attempts by other organisations to assess progress, and it is a disappointment that we do not have the materials that we require to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that the hon. Member for Eastbourne is no longer in the Room. I was pleased that he had an opportunity to unburden his fantasies about Europe's conspiracy to take over all aspects of our lives. He thinks that decentralisation is merely centralisation in another form and that it hands powers to Brussels, Strasbourg or elsewhere. Perhaps we will have an opportunity later in this debate or in another debate to scrutinise properly some of his rather fanciful claims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to recognise that the robust, candid friend, which is how Liberal Democrats always attempt to portray themselves in all of their activities, is different from the sycophantic lap-dog, which is the kind of image that I believe the Conservatives want to present. Therefore, we need a debate to challenge robustly the claim that the Government's devolution agenda, which Liberal Democrats support in broad principle, is in fact a stalking horse for handing powers over to a centralised Europe. I am sure that the Minister agrees that such a claim needs to be tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his opening remarks, the Minister claimed that the purpose of RDAs is to establish strategies for the regions from the ground up, not from the top down. I question whether that is what RDAs are actually doing. The Minister acknowledges the welcome fact that the chairs of each of the RDAs have regular six-weekly meetings with Ministers. They are accountable to Ministers for delivering Government policy and funds. As such, I question the extent to which they are primarily bottom-up organisations that draft strategies from the ground up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister pointed out, what was called a regional chamber is now a regional assembly in the south-west. I find it rather fatuous to call such bodies regional assemblies. It gives them the aura of democratic respectability, which clearly they do not have. The regional chamber in the south-west set up a select committee to scrutinise the progress and success of the RDA. The hon. Member for Eastbourne did not hear my riposte—I was not sure whether he was about to return to the matter of Europe—but I agree with some of his sentiments about regional chambers. In the main, they are talking shops and populated by agreeable people who, I am sure, have a nice time. They have no democratic legitimacy; they have little to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0602">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
do or to achieve on their agenda. What little credibility I considered they had was destroyed when the "assembly" in the south-west claimed that it was down to its efforts that Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly succeeded in achieving objective 1 status. It implied that it did not at the last minute get in the way of the clearly successful plan of the Government and Cornwall to address decades of economic decline—to the point at which GDP in Cornwall became massively lower than the European average. It is at the bottom of the league table in the United Kingdom. It did not step in the way of Cornwall achieving objective 1 status, but that it achieved it for us was fanciful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The extent of the regional assembly's scrutiny is demonstrated in a letter that I received from its chief executive on 10 September last year. The questions that it set out for the select committee were:
	<br><q><p>"Do the regional outcomes and targets which the RDA will be working towards have the support of the Region and its sub-regions?</p></q>
	<br><q><p>How will the Corporate Plan seek to complement the role and priorities of regional and sub-regional partners?</p></q>
	<br><q><p>How will the Corporate Plan seek to ensure that its proposals are consistent with the national, regional and sub-regional policy framework?"</p></q>
What worries me about the inquiry and the process of scrutiny is that they are process-driven, not product-driven. They are concerned mainly with the processes of economic development, and not with assessing whether the RDA has been successful and has achieved any discernable economic outcome in respects of jobs created or jobs sustained and improved competitiveness within the region. I suggested that the assembly should look at what the RDA has achieved, which would not otherwise have happened over two or three years. What has it done as a body, which would not have otherwise been undertaken by previous Government agencies? What has it added? How has it responded to those problems that often arise which require a greater than local response—a regional response—and which clearly demonstrate that the RDA is capable of responding to a crisis when it occurs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggested earlier to the Minister that RDAs should have responded to the serious crisis in transport, certainly in the south-west. Over the past two years in particular, many regions have been affected for various reasons, including the Hatfield crash and Railtrack's failure to respond and invest in the infrastructure. The south-west was also affected by flooding. The RDA claims to be the pre-eminent body for economic development of its region, and here was an opportunity for it to show leadership, to bring partners together, and to start rattling cages and get things moving. Although that is its role, nothing happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also suggested that the select committee should consider what benefits the RDA has achieved since it was established, apart from channelling public funds, that would not have occurred anyway. The committee has addressed none of the questions about additionality that an accountable Parliament would wish to raise in such a scrutiny process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
The Minister cited the example of the Rover taskforce, which I am sure was successful. However, surely another agency or Department could have brought partners together to achieve that result if there had been no RDA in the area? I would like to be told that everyone else would have sat on their hands had it not been for the RDA pulling that taskforce together. It would be interesting to know whether that is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister say whether there are internal contradictions in the way in which RDAs operate, as I implied in an earlier question? His predecessor, who was largely responsible for setting up the RDAs, made it clear that a primary concern was the failure of regions outside the south-east to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and to perform competitively along with the rest of the economy. The RDAs were specifically aimed at addressing that. It may be inevitable that improving GDP still further and trying to crank up the competitiveness of the south-east can be achieved only at the expense of other regions. A concern is whether certain RDAs need to be set different targets. The Minister's response reassured me, but I would like to see it made more explicit in the actions of the RDAs in London and the south-east. Internal regeneration is a priority in Thanet and other self-evidently impoverished London localities that clearly deserve further attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have another concern that I hope the Minister will address. Several regions in England have complained that the Welsh Development Agency has successfully poached jobs from them. We need to ensure that the internal investment intentions of RDAs do not result simply in the poaching of jobs from one region to another. Using public money to sustain the poaching of jobs from one region to another would result in a nil sum gain overall and would not greatly further the Government's aims of achieving economic regeneration throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eastbourne rightly raised the question of regional identities, but when we are talking about economic development on the scale that is necessary for populations of about 5 million, it does not matter where the boundaries are drawn or the head office is situated. As long as the organisation provides professional advice and channels Government public money efficiently, what it calls itself, where it is based and whether it has an identity is not an issue. It is a largely functional, not representative body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the overall strategy, I had some debate with the chairman of the South West of England Regional Development Agency, Sir Michael Lickiss, when he was first in post. I will be pointing out that we had a disagreement, so I should also make it clear that I dissociate myself from any of the comments made by the hon. Member for Bridgwater (Mr. Liddell-Grainger) about him in his Adjournment debate on 12 February. I respect Sir Michael Lickiss enormously and thought that the hon. Gentleman's comments were out of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From my discussions, it was clear that one of the RDA's top priorities was to establish a regional identity—this addresses the point raised by the hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0603">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
Member for Eastbourne—and a regional brand for produce from the south-west of England. Concern was strongly felt in Cornwall that such a move was not just unnecessary, but counterproductive to the attempts that Cornwall was making to drive its own strong brand image. As a Cornish Member of Parliament, I believe that Cornwall has a strong brand image, with Cornish cream, ice cream and whatever. My impression is that people generally know where Cornwall is and have a favourable view of the place. They think that the sun shines most of the time down there, which it does mostly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such circumstances, it would be highly counterproductive to tell one part of what is a synthetic region that it was not entitled to develop its own brand image, but that it must instead fall in with an image developed by the RDA. However, that was the approach taken by the South West of England Regional Development Agency for some time. It wanted to establish its own image because it was concerned that the south-west region did not exist in the minds of people. It wanted to create an identity, which is hard work and counterproductive when parts of the region already consider that they have identities of their own. To be fair to Sir Michael Lickiss, some time after our disagreement, he accepted the point and, to demonstrate that he is an honourable man, he came round to my way of thinking. He now agrees that the RDA has a role in co-ordinating efforts at trade shows for companies and brands in the region, but not in imposing a brand on an unwilling business base. The Minister should consider that point carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister responded as best he could to the question of complexity. I welcome the Government's efforts to bring more agencies and funding streams into the RDAs. Reducing the number of agencies, funding streams and level of complexity of economic development and match funding is unquestionably welcome. He may like to know that I secured an Adjournment debate in January 2000 on the future of objective 1 areas, in which I raised a question with the then Minister for Trade—who is now the Minister for Sport—about applicants who identify match funding for themselves. I asked him to produce a directory of all the funds that would be eligible for European objective 1 match funding. I was told that that could be done relatively quickly, but I am still waiting for that document. I understand that a draft was circulated by the Department of Trade and Industry in the Government office for the south-west, but as far as I am aware that document has not been published and made available to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This week, the 	<i>Financial Times</i> referred to a cross-party report by a committee of the Greater London Authority. The article said that the report claims that there
	<br><q><p>"is a 'minefield of overlapping schemes' that are run by organisations struggling to keep up with changing priorities."</p></q>
The report, which all parties support, also says that much of the regeneration programme is
	<br><q><p>"confusing, often with no clear links between different agencies working in the same area".</p></q>
It continues:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
	<br><q><p>"There is no intelligence base. Previous programmes have not been analysed or evaluated, and existing information on outputs is unreliable … We are concerned that current regeneration initiatives are being planned in a vacuum."</p></q>
I believe that a cross-party report by the GLA is worth considering and addressing. I know that people in other regions will say that the report's findings have resonance in their region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the progress of RDAs. I have read the most recent annual review of the South West of England Regional Development Agency. It was originally set absurdly low targets, although last year's targets were more realistic—all of which it has failed to meet. It missed the target of total jobs created or safeguarded by about 2,000. It has attracted private sector finance that is £13 million lower than the target that it attempted to meet. It has failed to achieve its target for new or refurbished work space by about 80 million sq m. If we are to judge RDAs, the Minister must address reports that show that RDAs are not achieving their targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Businesses in my area are worried about the lack of information from both Government offices and RDAs on the private investment programme to replace that vetoed by the EC at the end of 1999. Businesses have been told that they may apply for the programme, but that they must meet the project's regional priorities. The term "regional priorities" is new to businesses. They asked the RDA what the priorities are, but they are yet to receive an answer. That is not helpful. The project was started in January this year, and when businesses apply for it they must demonstrate that they meet the regional priorities that were set. However, businesses have not been told what the regional priorities are, and they are not clear on how the process will be assessed or how they can appeal against decisions with which they are disappointed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, regional selective assistance has worked reasonably well in certain sectors through Government offices, but I understand that it will now be delivered by RDAs. A range of questions relate to that, but I will not detain the Committee any longer on the matter. I will write to the Minister with the questions that businesses are asking me about the delivery of regional selective assistance within their regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eastbourne is right that we must broadly define what regions are, but that is not what this debate is about. I am concerned that one can have top-down defined regions that are established on the basis of bureaucratic convenience rather than community identity, which is a problem that must be dealt with. To some extent, we discussed that matter in the previous sitting in December 2001.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will demonstrate in the forthcoming White Paper that they are prepared to be flexible. They should try to ensure that voters do not stay home in their droves because they are faced with regional boundaries and regions with which they cannot identify. I hope that the Government have learned from the fiasco of their attempts to establish city mayors, and will take a more flexible approach, listen to what people on the ground are saying and be prepared to reflect boundaries and regions with which people can identify.

We must have devolution. It is unfinished business and, despite what the Conservatives say, it is clearly what many people want and is a logical extension of Government policy. The Government must simplify the process and make it more transparent, and, when we have regional government, dovetail it with the RDAs. Businesses and communities want a single point of entry and a single application form rather than, as I described earlier, needing a PhD to understand all the complexities of the Government's uneconomic delivery systems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The debate may not have added to the gaiety of the nation. However, to respond to the hon. Member for Eastbourne, we should not judge the importance of issues by the number of hon. Members who attend Committees such as this on a Thursday afternoon when there is a one-line Whip. We would have a bizarre view of political priorities if we were to determine issues on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair to say that this, like many other issues— local government, for example—does not set pulses racing. It is not the type of issue that people raise on the doorstep. Of course, nobody suggests that a bottom-up rather than top-down approach leads people to hold street parties to celebrate having an RDA and input into its economic strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's contribution, efficient and eloquent as ever, was rather blasé. It could be summarised as, "Constituents do not care about this issue; it is all a plot to set up a Europe of the regions, and there has been a bit of a ruck in the north-west". That was it, which is a shame. I am especially keen to see a consensus. We want the Conservative party on board. For example, Allan Willett tells me that, in one of the few areas in his region that has a swathe of blue, Conservative Members are having difficulty. He knows that they want to engage, but it is against their party policy and they feel encumbered by that. I would like to try to persuade Conservative Members to change their view—to go through the process of Letwinisation, so that they can look afresh at the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative party's stance on all the devolution issues is changing, because it had to change. Their approach to London—leaving London as the only major city in the world without an overarching authority—had to change. Their approach to Scotland had to change, because it was so out of kilter with what people felt: they were left without a single Scottish Member of Parliament, although they have got one now, and they have some Members of the Scottish Parliament—but only due to the list system, courtesy of proportional representation. They also had to change their approach to Wales, for similar reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
I cannot pretend that there is a huge tide of opinion in favour of regional development agencies, but there is a broad consensus about decentralisation. That stops at the barrier of devolution, so far as England is concerned. However, to pick up a point made by the hon. Member for St. Ives, we need an overview, and I shall look at his Adjournment debate of January 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth recognising that, before Christmas, the CBI compiled a comprehensive report on the regional development agencies. It stated:
	<br><q><p>"The RDAs provide a much-needed opportunity to give strategic direction and coherence to efforts to promote the economic development of the English Regions."</p></q>
It also said:
	<br><q><p>"we believe the RDAs deserve the solid support of all actors in the regional economies … It is right that the RDAs should be set tough targets clearly based on results."</p></q>
The report makes 10 constructive suggestions. Its main point—in the language of the introduction by John Cridland—is that we were promised a lion and we got a mouse. However, it accepts that RDAs were not fully developed in the first two and a half years— that period was one and a half years in London, when the report was compiled in December—and that they were merely administering predetermined programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chambers of commerce take a similar view. Local business people think that the regional development agencies are a good idea, but they say, "Now, it is time to deliver." That is in line with the CBI report. They say, "Now, we want to see outputs: so far, all we have seen are a lot of glossy documents and brochures and strategy documents." However, to be fair to the RDAs, that was largely their role in the first couple of years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative party should look again at the issue. There is no conspiracy here. On the one hand, people are accused of wanting to centralise all of the power in Brussels, and on the other hand they are accused of wanting to have a Europe of the regions. Perhaps we missed a trick after the second world war. We were instrumental in setting up the Länder system in Germany and we signed the European declaration on human rights, but did not put it into United Kingdom legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the major aspects of the matter under discussion is its potential to help areas and regions outside the south-east and London—such as the constituencies that almost all the Labour Committee members come from. A feeling that there was a north-south divide led to a drive in those regions and areas that something should be done to allow them to recover from some of the devastation that they had suffered because of the collapse of traditional industries, such as coal and steel. Therefore, it is wrong to say that, because it is not an issue that people raise on the doorstep, it is not important in terms of the future of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know what happened with regard to the ruck in the north-west—or even what was being quoting from. Naturally, there will be tensions—the hon. Member for St. Ives pointed to tensions in the south-west—about how to take this process forward.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V011P0I0605">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
All I ask is that Members of Parliament engage with their RDAs, and that the RDAs become engaged with their Members of Parliament. That is a fair criticism, and the RDAs accept it. However, for goodness sake do not do what the hon. Member for Bridgwater (Mr. Liddell-Grainger) did, which was to call for the resignation of an RDA chairman whom he had not met, nor spoken to, nor engaged with in any way, because that is unfair to individuals who have, by and large, done a tremendous job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also wish to mention the success of the UK economy—not only with regard to the latest statistics. To refer to a different issue, post 11 September we were advised not to raise the minimum wage because it would affect people on 1 October. We now have record employment levels again and another reduction in unemployment. Inflation, interest rates and other indicators are looking very good. Of course, no hyperbole is allowed in this Committee, but I think that the RDAs would say that they have at least contributed to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As Labour Members know, and as an hon. Member said at DTI questions this morning, when traditional industries died, new jobs were found. The RDAs have been good at bringing people together in situations such as that at Longbridge, which thankfully did not close. My hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, South (Mr. Pearson) was a member of the Longbridge taskforce. In answer to another questions, the RDAs were essential; without them, that taskforce may have been set up, but it would not have been so successful. The taskforce was the RDAs' idea, and it was led by someone who understood the automotive industry well. That was a great success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The economy is sound and we are attracting record levels of inward investment. We have the best record in Europe and are second only to the United States in the world. The hon. Member for St. Ives mentioned competition. We have mechanisms in place to ensure that there is none of the competition for inward investment between regions that means that the investment does not come to England at all. The Welsh Development Agency was good at walking off with jobs for Wales before the RDAs were set up. That is one reason why they were set up; it was amateur hour in the English regions. We now have strong measures in place. We have Invest UK and the RDAs to ensure that there is no internal competition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside made an important contribution. She has a track record on these issues and has been heavily involved with them. I did not know that she was on the Millan commission, but it showed in her thoughtful contribution on the issues. She mentioned regional venture capital funds, which are an important development. There are only two in existence, but soon every region will have such funds, which will be administered by the Small Business Service but set up by RDAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned broadband. As the hon. Member for Eastbourne knows, in the south-east no one can sit down with Allan Willett for two minutes without him mentioning broadband, which is a huge priority there. SEEDA has made broadband its priority, and it should perhaps be more of a priority elsewhere, too. My hon. Friend also mentioned spin-off from universities. Last year, such companies were three times the level of the year before. To a large extent, that was the responsibility of the RDAs for bringing the universities into their purview.

I am told by Lord Thomas of Macclesfield, to whom I pay tribute for his work, that even though aerospace forms a large part of the north-west economy, there was not a single university place to train people for the aerospace industry. That is changing because of a regional focus led by the RDAs. I agree with the points that my hon. Friend raised, and I think that they will be read with great interest by the RDAs when they receive transcripts of the debate.

The hon. Member for St. Ives made a thoughtful contribution. He was being a critical friend. Many of the points that he raised were about what is happening in the south-west and the scrutiny process. If we get the scrutiny process right, through whatever mechanism, it will help local people, local authorities and particularly Members of Parliament to have more faith in the system. I wonder whether the reasonable questions asked by the hon. Gentleman could not be asked of the RDA by him as an MP and his colleagues. They need answering.

The hon. Gentleman referred also to the targets that the RDAs set for themselves. The South West of England RDA set its own targets and, from the report, it seems that it fell short of them. Well, at least it had a stab at setting its own targets and circulating them. We are now setting the targets on those issues from a single pot—we are setting them centrally. We have discussed them; we will have the corporate plan, discuss it and reach agreement with the RDAs. It will be a more stringent method of examining the targets at the end of each financial year.

I shall not go so far as to say that I have enjoyed the debate—as if anyone enjoys two-and-a-half hours on a Thursday afternoon in a Committee Room—but it has been important. We need more such debates, because the RDAs will be an even more central feature of the economic success of the country in future years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
