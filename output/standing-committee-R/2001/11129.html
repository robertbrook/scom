<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Commission, whose work on an unusual joint project with the Land Registry led to the Bill, believes it to be the single largest project of law reform that it has ever undertaken. It is also one of the finest and will have a direct impact on the lives of millions of people who buy and sell property in England and Wales each year. I suspect that most Members have an interest in the Bill as home owners. I do, and as my wife and I also own a long leasehold on commercial property which would be affected by the changes in the registration period of leases, I declare a wider interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill can be viewed in two ways. First, it represents the culmination of the long process through which land registration has developed to dominate the recording and guaranteeing of title to land in England and Wales. It also marks a new departure by providing the framework for electronic conveyancing which, through relatively minor alterations in the law, will change the way in which conveyancing services are provided and make a major contribution to the Government's campaign to improve the home-buying process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall start with the past. The Bill will wholly replace the Land Registration Act 1925, which was in many ways backward looking because much of it derived from elements in Acts of 1875 and 1897. Although the development of the system of land registration began in earnest 60 years earlier, it was still, if not quite an infant, barely a toddler. Compulsory registration began in 1897, but by 1925 it still applied only in Greater London. Its extension to the rest of England and Wales did not accelerate in earnest until after the second world war. Compulsory
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
registration finally covered the whole of England and Wales only in 1990.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Land registration has necessarily sat alongside the essentially historical process of unregistered conveyancing, which derives a relative title from the deeds and other papers relating to the property, and from what is known about the land, its history, its current condition and occupiers. Unregistered conveyancing, which falls outwith the Bill, is a body of law that has justly deserved a reputation for complexity. That has provided endless intellectual stimulation to generations of lawyers. It is not a system noted for giving users clarity of information about the land, its benefits and obligations, the identity of the owner, and the extent of his or her powers. That is essential information. It is the aim of the system of land registration to do that in the clearest and most comprehensive way possible, and for the resulting register to be guaranteed by the state. The Bill will extend and refine the achievements of previous land registration legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the Bill will lead to more land and more interests in land being protected by registration. Some valuable interests—for example, fishing and shooting rights—will, for the first time, be registrable voluntarily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the scope of compulsory registration will also be increased, in particular by bringing most leases and, therefore, most commercial property transactions, within its reach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, what the register tells us about the land will be extended and improved, most notably by reducing the number and scope of interests that can impose burdens without appearing on the register. The benefits of the registered system will also be extended. The procedures protecting the rights of third parties over land will be simplified and strengthened. The protection that registration offers to registered owners against squatters will be improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those reforms and improvements alone represent a formidable achievement. Cumulatively, they will have the effect of making the law clearer and more certain. They might have been sufficient on their own to ensure that, within a relatively short period, land registration would completely replace unregistered conveyancing. However, in a few clauses the Bill will also hugely increase the attraction of registration. It will open the way for radical changes over time in the way in which the formal documents required in conveyancing are prepared, the quality and speed of the services that conveyancers are able to provide, and in the relationship between conveyancers and the Land Registry. That process, which is described in shorthand as electronic conveyancing, will complete a technological revolution in which the Land Registry has been engaged for more than a decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Successive chief land registrars have given high priority to the progressive automation of the registry's work. Imaginative and successful projects, usually in partnership with the private sector, have revolutionised the delivery of services. The most fundamental of those projects has been the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0637">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
translation of all registered titles into computerised form. At the end of last year, 96 per cent. of all titles were held in that way and by the end of 2003, all titles will be. Work is now under way on the huge project of making all the millions of supporting documents referred to in the register available electronically. That, too, will be complete in 2003.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The registry's customers are increasingly used to online services. A wide range became available in 1994 and the Land Registry direct service now deals with approximately 350,000 transactions each month, generating a monthly fee income of around £500,000. In 1999, it also became possible to notify the discharge of a mortgage electronically. There are now around 48,000 online notifications each month. The Bill will crown those developments by making it possible to execute and deliver the formal documents effecting disposition of land or interest in land by electronic means. For buyers, transactions will be quicker, cheaper and thereby less stressful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two themes of improving the register and developing electronic conveyancing come together to produce the single, fundamental objective for the Bill. Under the system of electronic dealing with land that it seeks to create, the register should be as complete and accurate a reflection of the state of title of land at any given time as is reasonably practicable so that it is possible to investigate title to land online with the absolute minimum of additional inquiries and inspections. The implications of that objective are considerable and virtually all the changes that the Bill makes to the present law flow directly from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall proceed to consider more specifically but relatively briefly how the Bill gives effect to that objective and its implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part 1 continues the register of title. The heart of the Bill's measures to improve the inclusiveness and comprehensiveness of the register are to be found in parts 2 and 3, which cover the first entry of land or an interest in land on to the register, and subsequent transactions, respectively. Together, they tackle the problem that the land register is currently not complete, either geographically or in terms of the interest it records.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part 2 describes when unregistered land can or must be registered and offers better protection for people with legitimate interest in knowing when land will be added to the register. Voluntary registration will become possible in two cases where it is presently not. Certain incorporeal rights—notably fishing and shooting rights, which often have considerable economic value and are frequently bought and sold—will become registrable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important change to the provisions governing compulsory first registration is that the length of granted or assigned leases that are subject to compulsory registration will be reduced from 21 years or over to seven years or over. The Lord Chancellor will also be given powers to change the triggers for compulsory registration. The most likely use of those powers is to reduce further the length of leases requiring registration, should that meet the needs of
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
the market and be possible for the Land Registry at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Currently, most business leases cannot be registered. Commercial conveyancing is therefore required to use cumbersome and complex unregistered law, and is excluded from the current benefits and protections of registration, and from those that the Bill will develop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a linked gain. All changes that increase registrable estates will also increase information on property transactions held by the registry. Such changes will therefore enhance the registry's ability to improve transparency in the property market by publishing accurate and neutral information on prices and market trends. Such information will undoubtedly be widely welcomed and will help development of the property market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill makes it clear who should apply for registration where that is compulsory, what happens if that is not done, and who is liable for defective transfers in such cases. It also tackles the problems associated with unregistered rights or obligations, which, regrettably, remain excessively frequent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a small point, but as the Minister says, cumbersome unregistered conveyancing will continue, and there will remain unregistered title to land. Will he confirm, either now or in due course, that the land charges register will continue, and whether it will be accessible by electronic means?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm both those points, and I shall be happy to return to them later should the hon. Gentleman wish to develop his question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overriding interests are an important and problematic aspect of current law. Such interests bind any person who acquires an interest in registered land, whether on first registration or on a subsequent registrable disposition, but they do not need to be—in some cases cannot be—registered. Those interests cover a significant range, including many easements, the rights of people in occupation of the land, leases granted for 21 years or less, and an array of other interests such as manorial rights, which may be obscure but also very onerous. They are a serious obstacle to the objective of making the register as complete a record of the title as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill reshapes the law, seeking to restrict such interests as far as possible. The guiding principle is that interests should override only when it is unreasonable to expect them to be protected in the register. Current categories of such interests are defined more narrowly in the Bill, and some are excluded. Some of the more obscure interests cease to be automatically protected if not registered within 10 years, but can be entered on the appropriate register without charge in the interim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part 3 and its schedule deal with land that is already on the register. Part 3 clarifies the powers that a registered proprietor has in relation to the estate, removing a number of uncertainties in current law with a view to ensuring that the register can provide all necessary information on the title. It lists transactions with registered land that transfer or create a legal
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0638">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
estate, and which should be completed by registration. As with first registration, a new requirement to register leases granted for more than seven years will be introduced, with a power to reduce that period still further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parts 4, 5 and 6 improve and strengthen registration procedures, and part 7 provides for some important special cases for registration. Although part 8, which deals with electronic conveyancing, is one of the shortest parts, it will undoubtedly effect the greatest changes. An electronic conveyancing system could help to eliminate the anxieties of those unfortunate enough to be at the end of the conveyancing chain, sitting in the removal van and waiting for payments to pass along the chain so that the keys can be released.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not, and in our view should not, set out in detail how full electronic conveyancing should work. Instead, it provides a framework for options that, on implementation, will meet the needs of customers, conveyancers and the registry, but which themselves can be adapted and modernised quickly as electronic conveyancing and electronic commerce develop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Land Registry has begun an intensive campaign of consultation with conveyancers and all others involved in buying and selling property. That is necessary not simply because there is a range of options for the system—or systems—through which electronic conveyancing will operate, but because it will require conveyancers themselves to work with the systems. They must therefore meet not only the registry's requirements, but those of a modern conveyancing practice. The system's essence will be electronic preparation, execution and distribution of the formal documents—the contract and conveyance—used for dispositions of land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the parties are satisfied with those documents, the conveyancer will be authorised, subject to appropriate safeguards, to make direct changes in the register itself. That brings two major benefits. First, conveyancers will use expert systems to prepare documents, which will prove quicker and cheaper than paper systems. Automatic checks with the Land Registry will also be permitted, so that possible errors can be identified at an early stage, rather than at the end of the process, as is all too often the case at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, completion and registration will take effect simultaneously. The new arrangements will wholly eliminate the delay that inevitably occurs between the conveyancer's sending paper documents to the registry, and their entry in the register. That registration gap creates a range of problems of its own. At worst, the transaction can take place in the registration gap, whether accidentally or otherwise, and affect the rights of one party to the main transaction. At the other end of the spectrum, because of the registration gap information published by the registry on trends in the market can be as much as six weeks out of date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Electronic conveyancing will also foster the development of an electronic fund transfer system that will help those involved to tackle the problems of delay and uncertainty in that part of the process. Legislative provision for that system is not necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The introduction of electronic conveyancing will be progressive, starting with the simpler conveyancing transactions and adding complex ones as conveyancers become used to operating within the network. However, the Bill provides a power for electronic conveyancing eventually to be made compulsory for some or all transactions, because some advantages can be maximised only when conveyancing is wholly through electronic means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The example of most immediate interest to home buyers and sellers is perhaps that of an electronic network for land registration. It would create an entirely new capacity to make often very complex transaction chains transparent by identifying those participants that are falling behind the rest, so that they can be encouraged to catch up. It would also remove the need for progress reports to be relayed repeatedly up and down chains of conveyancers, a process that inevitably results in time lag and Chinese whispers. There is much to be said for the system in England and Wales, which permits huge numbers to buy and sell on the same day, thereby avoiding the trouble and expense of arranging bridging loans or alternative accommodation, as well as the attendant stress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that chain delays are responsible for much of the slowness and stressfulness that is inherent in house buying, and anything that reduces that must be welcome. Equally obviously, if even a single transaction in a chain is managed on paper, rather than electronically, transparency is muddied and the advantages of the new capacity are lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are, therefore, real and practical advantages in making electronic conveyancing universal, but that cannot be a realistic option until it has become the usual method of registered conveyancing. The Bill requires the Lord Chancellor to consult before making electronic conveyancing compulsory, and he will want to do so widely. Following amendments in another place, he must also secure the agreement of both Houses by affirmative resolution to the necessary order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Land Registry must also ensure that those who wish to undertake their own conveyancing without employing a solicitor or licensed coveyancer are able to make transactions in electronic form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part 9 extends the protection against adverse possession given to owners by registration. The principle should be that where title is registered, the basis of title should primarily be the fact of registration. This is not the current position with either registered or unregistered land, where the title rests ultimately on possession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Put at its shortest, anyone who takes possession of land acquires a possessory title. If they hold on to it for the length of the relevant limitation period, which is currently 12 years, they cannot be shifted. This may be appropriate in the inherently relative titles of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0639">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
unregistered conveyancing, but it seriously undermines the certainty that registration aims to provide.

The current law has undoubtedly given rise to a number of abuses and straightforward land theft. However, it does enable some of the problems that occur with land to be dealt with. There are the public interest benefits, if land held by an owner who takes no interest in it can be returned to economic use. Even within the registered system, there is scope for reasonable doubt as to where boundaries lie. For example, it is by no means uncommon for the fences and other partitions in a newly developed estate to be put up in places that differ from those shown on the register. Due account has to be taken of those who have reasonably occupied and spent money on land that they thought was theirs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part 9 sets out a package that balances the competing interests involved. The main features are, first, that a squatter will be entitled to apply to register as a proprietor after 10 years' adverse possession. Secondly, those with a direct interest must be told of the application, and if there are no objections, the squatter will be registered as proprietor. Thirdly, if an objection is raised, the application will be refused unless the squatter can show that it will be unfair for him or her to be dispossessed because he or she had reasonably believed that he or she owned the land. Fourthly, if the application is refused, and the registered proprietor does not take steps to evict the squatter within a further two years, the squatter can apply for registration again, and this time he or she will be registered as proprietor whether or not the registered proprietor objects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parts 10 and 11 complete the provisions relating to the administration of land registry. The most significant change from the current arrangements is the establishment of a new and independent judicial officer, to determine registration disputes between individuals, ensuring that the arrangements are wholly compliant with the European convention on human rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part 12 contains a number of miscellaneous and general provisions that ensure the effective operation of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matters with which the Bill deals are varied and complex. They will affect, in large and small matters, every aspect of the sale of registered land, and create a new relationship between conveyancers and the Land Registry's own responsibilities. I am confident that the systems that will govern that relationship will improve not only the Land Registry's public services, but will give solicitors and licensed conveyancers the chance to develop and improve their own professional services and give the customer a better deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I started my speech by referring to the size of the project that the Law Commission and the Land Registry had undertaken. It is not surprising that work on this scale has taken over five years. As an essential part of the programme, a major consultation paper issued in 1998 covered all the issues now covered by the Bill. The proposals were considerably refined and improved in the light of the help from the consultation response and in the discussions and
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
seminars that followed it. It will be obvious from what I have already said about the clarification and improvements that are made by the Bill in this formidably technical area of law, that it represents an achievement of the highest order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to put on record my gratitude, and the Government's gratitude, for that achievement to the law commissioner responsible for it, Mr. Charles Harpum, whose time at the Law Commission has only recently concluded, and to the parliamentary counsel seconded to the commission with whom Mr. Harpum has worked throughout. We are extremely grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Bill and the proposals for a seller's pack, the Bill forms part of a comprehensive programme for the delivery of a thorough-going modernisation in registration law and in conveyancing services. It is the best kind of law reform. It clarifies principles, reforms practices and makes the law simpler and more accessible. Above all, it is a practical Bill, which will make home-buying and selling quicker, simpler and cheaper. That will make a real difference to people's lives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.54 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Cash 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, thank those who put together the Bill, which is monumental in its complexity and technicalities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I declare an interest as a solicitor and a landowner. I also declare the fact that I always found conveyancing to be an immensely complicated subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the Minister's explanation was more than adequate, and that the Bill has been through the processes of the Law Commission and the Land Registry— not to mention the House of Lords, where it was extremely carefully examined—it is unnecessary for me to make a prolonged speech that replicates what has already been said, and I shall not detain the Committee for long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several matters remain undetermined, and I shall turn to those in a moment. First, I want to place on the record a tribute to the extremely hard work that has been put in by the lawyers who have assisted not only Ministers, but the Opposition, in the House of Lords. In dealing with the complexities of this kind of law, it is essential to have access to proper explanations from people who are sufficiently expert. It helps enormously to have a proper dialogue, even if it is to a certain extent vicarious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We broadly welcome the Bill, and believe that it will lay the foundations for a system of electronic conveyancing that will be extremely helpful and bring the whole business up to date. It will provide a faster and more open mechanism for the buying and selling of homes and will have real benefits for consumers. As the Minister said, it will affect millions of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By common consent, the Land Registration Act 1925 had to be pulled through a hedge backwards. The repeals schedule shows that this is a radical Bill in the sense that it gets to the roots of what has happened in the past and how to bring ourselves into the 21st century. As someone who had to go through the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0640">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
rigours of conveyancing examinations, it is quite something to see such great trees being felled in one simple repeals schedule. I remember sweating over those provisions, and would have wanted them to be repealed a great deal earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are engaging in a sensible pace of reform. Initially, the system will apply only to certain simple registered transactions, and other transactions will become subject to it as time progresses. Ultimately, the system will have to be compulsory if the full benefits are to be realised, but paragraph 5 of the explanatory notes makes it clear that that will be feasible only when electronic conveyancing has become the most effective way of dealing with transactions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 5 gives the Lord Chancellor the power to make electronic conveyancing compulsory by order at a later date. We are glad to note that that will be achieved by way of consultation. All sorts of problems can crop up, and there are many expert solicitors, licensed conveyancers and others who deal with such matters on a day-to-day basis. All those who have advised on the process, including those in the Land Registry, will acknowledge that any practical, day-to-day problems that come to light as a result of advice tendered by the Law Society and the Bar will be best resolved through sensible co-operation between Opposition Members and the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultation process is essential. The Bill is just sheets of paper at the moment, but when it is translated into the realities of daily life it will have a huge impact on millions of people throughout the land. We must therefore exert ourselves to the maximum to ensure that it is not only theoretically and intellectually coherent, but practical. I hope that the Minister will be happy to respond to any practical points that are raised by the practising professions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several matters of concern remain, some of which were traversed in the House of Lords but were not satisfactorily resolved. The practising professions are worried that the manner by which documents are executed involves the potential for fraud. Clause 91 provides that electronic documents will be authenticated by electronic signatures. As it stands, the electronic signing agent must give an absolute warranty of authority even if he has been, without carelessness, the victim of an impostor client. Professionals are unlikely to be prepared to use an electronic system that imposes such a risk upon them. If an agent affixes an electronic signature on behalf of someone who turns out to be an impostor, it should have no more validity than an impostor's written signature would have on a paper document. I hope that the Minister and his advisers will consider that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the method of certification, the explanatory notes state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Certification is the mechanism by which an electronic signature is authenticated."</p></blockquote>
However, the Bill itself does not specify a particular method by which certification will be achieved. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Government justify that lack of prescription by stating in the explanatory notes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are already several ways in which authentication could be achieved, but they are likely to change and develop with general electronic business and commerce."</p></blockquote>
We understand that and accept that it is a fair point. The Government are bound to find it difficult to legislate for the future in relation to unforeseen developments. However, the system will depend very much on the professionalism and integrity of conveyancers. Before any detailed rule setting out the requirements for electronic signatures, certification and authentication can be established, there must be a clear commitment to extensive and detailed consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a modern—dare I say, new Labour— technique to make rule-making powers and regulations the buttress of a Bill. That has implications for our legislative methods, especially with regard to subordinate legislation. I was glad that an amendment was made to one of the most important provisions in the Bill to ensure a more effective way of examining statutory instruments in relation to any annulment procedure. The Bill contains a huge number of rule-making powers, although I hastily add that some 300 rules already exist in relation to the land registration system. I will not harp on about that negatively because I understand that it is essential for the Lord Chancellor, and those who advise him, to be able to make changes in an appropriate fashion on such a complex matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has complexities in its references to profits, grand or gross—I have forgotten the exact expression. Those complexities must be dealt with through consultation, but are best dealt with by the rulemaking procedure, which would also require much consultation as rules emerge. I am sure that the Minister will be happy to confirm that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Advisers to the Minister are no doubt expecting me to move on to the length of registrable leases. It is one of the hottest issues in the Bill. Within the profession, it is generally thought that compulsory registration of leases in excess of seven years is not necessary or desirable at this stage. The Law Society and other bodies have made it clear that they would prefer a system of compulsory registration of leases with terms of 14 years or more. In the event that that were successful, the term of registrable leases could be reduced and the Bill contains the power to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is concern over the ability of the Land Registry to deal with the vast increase in applications for registration, in addition to concerns over the adverse impact on the cost-sensitive, small-value commercial market, which is faced with the additional cost of registering leases of under 21 years. That has already been examined in the House of Lords, but it is a practical question. It was raised by the my noble Friend Baroness Buscombe when she moved amendments that would have reduced the length of leases that must be registered from 21 to 14 years, instead of to seven years. I will not explain the arguments because they are in 	<i>Hansard,</i> but I will quote from a briefing given to her by the Country Landowners Association—I expect that it will be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0641">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
communicating with me soon. Practical questions were raised and I will quote from the briefing to set the scene for future interesting debate in Committee. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"By making such leases compulsorily registrable landlords and tenants will be put to greater expense."</p></blockquote>
Bear in mind the Minister's comments about making the system cheaper. Whenever one puts people— whether they be landlords or tenants—to greater expense, it has an inflationary effect. The mechanics of the system may be designed to make things cheaper, but if, in practice, they become more expensive for the consumer, it might be regarded as counterproductive. The argument continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The current consultation paper on business tenancies, rightly, seeks to remove some of the more cumbersome procedures regarding obtaining exclusions from the security of tenure provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 Part II. Yet by reducing the qualifying term to 7 years, in the CLA's opinion, an unnecessarily bureaucratic burden is going to be placed on both landlords and tenants and their advisors.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The introduction of such leases into the realms of compulsory registration would also impact upon many farm business tenancies which at present do not need to be concerned with registration since their term is rarely more than 21 years."</p></blockquote>
That has been borne out in my experience as a Member of Parliament for a rural constituency. Finally, it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Many of the CLA's members are parties to such tenancies"—</p></blockquote>
I am sure that the NFU will have something to say on the matter—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and consequently, given the current state of the rural economy should not be subjected to any increase in the bureaucratic burden that will be brought to bear by this enactment."</p></blockquote>
I ask the Minister to bear those points in mind because they will be returned to in Committee. They are practical questions that deal with the need to contain expense, reduce bureaucracy and make legislation clearer—points that he has raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Client confidentiality is another important question. All professional lawyers are concerned that the overriding principle of client confidentiality is maintained under whatever system is ultimately introduced for the provision of electronic conveyancing. The Law Society made it clear that it does not believe, on the grounds of client confidentiality, that copies of leases and mortgages should be available to anyone who asks for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have acknowledged the excellent work done on the Bill in the House of Lords and, as we proceed to Committee, I look forward to a constructive and sometimes technical debate with the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.10 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Burnett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torridge and West Devon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like most hon. Members, I welcome the Bill, but some important aspects warrant further study and some require change. The Minister said that the Bill is important because it will impact on the lives of all our constituents—or at least most of them. From the start, I will declare that I was a practising solicitor for many years and, apparently, that must still appear on the Register of Members' Interests, notwithstanding that I ceased to practice years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Although land law and conveyancing was not the principal area of my work, I did some conveyancing work, especially in connection with trust law and tax law. I dealt with much unregistered property and, although my knowledge is rather out of date, I understand that the only land that falls to be purchased compulsorily is that which is unregistered and sold for consideration, which must then be registered at the Land Registry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to put on record my thanks to Mr. Charles Harpum and the Law Commission for their work on the Bill and to bring the system of land registration up to date. I shall later refer to a useful debate on electronic conveyancing that took place on 9 November 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support steps to make conveyancing simpler, more accurate and expeditious, and less costly. There is still a significant amount of unregistered land, especially in my constituency, and I should declare that I am the owner of some of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should clarify that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have done so in the Register of Members' Interests, which is open for all to see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one or two points to make about land registration. I believe that a useful step to save time, confusion and money would be for the Land Registry, on a first registration, to give notice to that effect to owners of adjoining properties so that boundaries could be agreed on at an early stage. In addition, notice of the extent of rights of way purportedly benefiting or passing over the land subject to the first registration could also be ascertained and agreed. I am talking about first registration where adjoining property is not registered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received many complaints and queries from individuals who own unregistered land and who have boundaries encroaching on their land on first registration. That has often led to considerable litigation and costs. I should have thought that my proposal was a sensible step that would prevent that problem and lessen the proposed new independent adjudicator's work. I should also like to know about the verification of title in unregistered conveyancing because most unregistered property involved in a transaction is not registered during that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who or what organisations can give certification on copy documents of title to the effect that such a document is a true copy? Not only copy documents, but the stamps on them need to be verified. I should like to know the names of the professional organisations that are authorised to issue these certificates. Does the Land Registry accept certification from individuals who undertake their own conveyancing?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the proposal for an independent adjudicator to decide disputes under the Bill. I look forward to hearing from the Minister on the details of the qualifications of the person who is to be appointed adjudicator. To whom would such an individual be responsible and who will appoint them? Will he confirm that the independent adjudicator will not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0642">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
oust the jurisdiction of the courts? I am sure that all parties will continue to have the right to take matters to court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the independent adjudication proposal is in its embryonic stages, but it would be helpful to know the Minister's thoughts on the costs of using the adjudicator. Will the adjudicator have the right to award costs against unsuccessful parties? Does he envisage that the adjudicator will have both written and oral hearings?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also be glad if the Minister were to flesh out further the indemnity principle with regard to the Land Registry. If a person with absolute title has their title defeated, it is incumbent on the Land Registry to make reparation. If a person suffers loss because of a mistake on the register, they are entitled to be indemnified for that loss. After the Minister has given us further details on the extent of that indemnity, it would be worthwhile for him to put on record that the Government do not propose to change it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the Land Registry, over recent years it has become more efficient, but sometimes the volume of work is such that there are delays. There should be a system of rebating fees where there is no reasonable excuse for those delays. I said at the beginning of the debate that my knowledge of this subject is out of date, and such a system may already be in place. If that is the case, is it discretionary or mandatory on the Land Registry to pay reparations or rebate fees where there is no reasonable excuse for its delays?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister set out for the Committee the thinking behind the fees charged by the Land Registry? Do the fees that are charged and paid solely cover the cost of running the Land Registry? If there is a surplus, I suspect that it goes to the Treasury. It would be interesting to know the total fees charged on an annual basis during the past five years, and the extent to which those fees have exceeded the cost of running the Land Registry. I am aware that a quinquennial review of the Land Registry has recently been completed, and I am anxious to know whether he is satisfied that a five-year review period is adequate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is always debate about the standards and speed of the Land Registry. Examining that debate from the Land Registry's point of view, if its personnel discover constantly slapdash and shoddy work by conveyancers, do they report that to the appropriate professional body for the conveyancers in question?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill proposes a tightening of the rules for overriding interests that bind a purchaser of land even though those interests are unregistered. The matter was referred to my hon. and learned Friend Lord Goodhart in the other place. He is a lawyer of great distinction, and it would be worthwhile for the Minister and his officials to note his comments not only on this point, but on the registration of leases and adverse possession. I agree with him that a reduction in the minimum period of registrable leases to below seven years is of questionable value. I also agree with
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
his comments on adverse possession, and given that the new procedure in the Bill will not apply to unregistered land, I should be grateful for the Minister's comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill also deals with Crown land. Where the Crown owns its land directly it has not been open for it to register that land. I am pleased that the Bill provides a procedure for the voluntary registration of Crown land, and I hope that the Minister will encourage the various Departments of State voluntarily to register. Where land has reverted to the Crown under the doctrine of bona vacantia, no one will know that that is the case until lengthy inquiries have been completed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Minister's reply to my earlier intervention, he confirmed that it will become possible to access the register of charges by electronic means. When is that likely to occur?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society is concerned about the way in which documents are executed. These concerns revolve around the potential for fraud, the method of certification, the length of registrable leases and client confidentiality. These are all important matters to which I shall refer again in Committee, as will the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the introduction of a framework for electronic conveyancing, although it should not be introduced on a mandatory basis at the whim of the Lord Chancellor. I am glad that by amendment in the other place that change must be approved by affirmative order of both Houses. The details of the system will be settled by rules that must necessarily be considered in due course, and I note that the Minister has confirmed that there will be wide consultation on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the introduction of the steps that we discussed in the electronic conveyancing debate on 9 November 2000, and with the proposed changes for the Land Registry, the public should have a cheaper, swifter, more cost-effective and, I hope, more accurate system of transferring property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Unfortunately, the Bradford and Bingley managed to destroy our deeds in a fire, and our property was not registered because it is old. However, a substitute registration has now taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I had intervened on the Minister, Mr. Hancock, you would rightly have limited my intervention because one cannot make a speech in such circumstances. However, in making a speech I have the advantage of being able to ask a number of questions, and that is my purpose on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the other place, the Earl of Caithness said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have always been able to rely on the maps which are attached to leases and conveyances."— [	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 3 July 2001; Vol. 626, c. 782.]</p></blockquote>
The Earl of Caithness obviously has not seen my casework. The Minister has suggested that there are indeed certain problems. He said:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0643">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The current law has undoubtedly given rise to a number of abuses and straightforward land theft … Even within the registered system, there is scope for reasonable doubt as to where boundaries lie."</p></blockquote>
He proceeded to discuss new developments and the location of fences, and such difficulties do indeed arise. It is clear that the registration of boundary positions with the Land Registry is a matter of great significance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill provides for the supposedly much more precise method of electronic conveyancing. Will electronic conveyancing mean that problems such as those associated with boundaries and the registration of cross deeds—the Minister is aware of them—will be tackled properly and be less likely to arise? In certain cases, the question of who registered their deeds first may prove problematic. Indeed, one of my own cases concerns new property and a three-share drive, with the records for each property differing slightly. Such matters are covered by Land Registry provisions, and one assumes that advanced technology will enable the Land Registry to deal with them with greater precision. Technology will presumably alert the Land Registry automatically where a deed registration crosses with an earlier registration, and such cases will no longer slip through the net.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the problem of development of new property on distinctive plots on registered estate land. The Minister mentioned the example of someone who receives rather more property than the boundaries entitle them to, and in such cases someone else inevitably receives rather less than they are entitled to. I know of many such cases, and the courts are likely to take the view that the person purchased what they had seen, ignoring the fact that only subsequently was it discovered that the boundary extended further than the fence. I hope that the new technology will help us to avoid such problems, that the involvement of the courts will become less necessary, and that the Land Registry will be able to produce substantial and important evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Problems can arise with conveyancing solicitors when a case enters into boundary dispute and goes to court. Is it advisable for the conveyancing solicitor— the person with whom the client has been in touch—to be involved in briefing the barrister when it comes to appeal? It might be the case that the slip up in registration was made by the conveyancing solicitor. In most cases, such solicitors should be prevented from engaging in that type of activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not here as an apologist for the legal profession, but I hope that the hon.

Because of the problems that I have illustrated, I am pleased to see provisions in the Bill for a new, independent judicial officer. Such a person might be able to play a role in such cases that would obviate the problem of matters reaching a stage that necessitates going to court. If that makes matters simpler and more effective in terms of land registration, it is welcome, although we shall have to look at specific items as we proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to talk about the parts of the Bill that are not there, rather than what is there. It is a complex Bill and a lot of work has gone into it, but there is a glaring omission. It fails to address the fact that the land registrar and his immediate predecessors say that some 2 million land titles, out of a potential total of around 22 million, are unregistered. According to the last estimate made by a land registrar in 1992, those 2 million unregistered titles might cover as much as 50 per cent., and probably not less than 30 per cent., of the acreage of England and Wales. That is an incredible amount of land that is not registered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My near neighbour, my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett), declared a property holding that is minute compared with the size of his constituency, which is the second largest in England. I must declare a small land holding in my constituency. I suspect that, given that it is in a small urban area, my holding is significantly greater in percentage terms than that of my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The history of land registration is important when considering the Bill. Attempts to establish a universal Land Registry for England and Wales began in 1862. That attempt failed. The intimate history of the ensuing years is hidden in the midst of history or buried in now undiscoverable files. However, we know that only 650 titles had been registered in 13 years, a rate of 50 a year from a total estimated 5 million land titles in the country at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1875, a new Act was passed, with even more lamentable results. According to the official Land Registry history, the Act proved to be an even more dismal failure than its predecessor. In the three and a half years of the Act's operation, only 28 titles were registered, so the rate had decreased from 50 to fewer than seven a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to touch on a single obscure fact that should be central to our deliberations. In 1872, before the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0644">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
1875 Act, the House heard a request and acted on the creation of what was known as a new Domesday. That was a complete record of all land owned, not merely in England and Wales, but in Scotland and Ireland too. That record, which commenced in February 1872, was completed in 1873 for Scotland, a year later for England and Wales and two years later for Ireland. That was done without the benefit of lawyers, satellite photographs or computers, but with quill pens and ink. In the return of owners of land, the Victorians created an embryonic Land Registry that was more than 90 per cent. accurate and more than 90 per cent. complete. We should pause to wonder why, 129 years later, we have what amounts to half a Land Registry for England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1925, without a debate in either House, the Land Registration Act 1925 set up what we now know as the Land Registry of England and Wales. Between 1925 and 1990, a period of 65 years, the new Land Registry managed to achieve, at most, half that which had been achieved by the return of owners of land in four years from 1872. The modern Land Registry reached its present state of incompleteness on a rolling basis and on what is now an unacceptable principle; that registration should occur only when a transaction in land takes place. By 1990, 60 years after the Land Registry started work, mandatory registration of land, even on such a restricted basis, applied only to some parts of the country. The Victorian return of owners of land was created on the principle that we should now impose—that those who own land must disclose and register it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is important because land is the core economic resource in this country. Most bank lending is based on land assets. All domestic mortgage lending is based on the security of land. Transactions in land, domestic and commercial, probably represent the largest single sector of the economy. However, we learn that a significant proportion of the land is not registered at all. The Bill contains no proposal to remedy that defect, and the ultimate reason for that is the indulgence of Parliament. In effect, we have created two classes of citizens. Those who own land and must register it, mostly domestic home owners, and those who own land and do not have to register it, mostly larger, asset-rich landowners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that respect, I question the assertion that the Bill complies with the European convention on human rights. It is an unwritten principle of the British constitution, which precedes and underlies the convention, that all citizens are equal before the law, but in this respect, the law is unequal. It excuses the largest landowners in the country from registration on no logical or reasonable basis and enforces registration on the humble home owner. The Bill suspends a citizen's rights under article 8 to domestic privacy, but does not do so equitably. It grants an absolute right of privacy to one class of landowner but suspends it in the case of another. The Bill is fundamentally flawed in principle and in detail, as were its predecessors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Should I infer from the hon. Gentleman's remarks that he will oppose the Bill with tenacity

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sanders</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is my intention to ensure that the Bill is amended to correct its defects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will concede that all land registration rules and laws affect everyone, and that it is merely fortuitous and a fact of life that anyone, however rich or poor, who makes a voluntary disposition of unregistered land does not have to register it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sanders</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct but that does not take away from the fact that possibly 50 per cent. of land in this country is not registered and we have no right to find out who its owners are. That has massive implications for planning decisions, where economic activity takes place and where national projects can be sited. For example, one of the reasons we do not have a high-speed rail link to the channel tunnel is because we cannot establish who owns all the land between the coast and the capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the Bill is fundamentally flawed. The mobility of labour and capital are well established principles of the modern market economy, but a third principle has carefully been obscured in the UK—the mobility of the single largest resource in the economy, which is land. The mobility of land is as important as the mobility of capital and labour, and the Bill must do what it can to assist the mobilisation of land by ensuring its total registration. Let us not have half a job done where the Victorians, with their quill pens, did the job in less than four years. It is time to address the issue that the Victorian easily solved and to solve it as quickly as we can because it is vital to our economy that we should do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to tax my hon. Friend's patience but, in 1872, when the Victorian register was produced, very few people owned land in England and Wales, and it was, therefore, a relatively simple process to draw up a register of ownership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that we will not go into too much detail on that argument. Let us keep this row in the family. I suggest that we move on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sanders</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are seeing the traditional split between the radical liberal and the Whig element of the party, but we will not pursue that line of debate.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to intrude on private grief, but I must declare an interest as my family—John Bright—were the founders of the co-operative movement in Rochdale, so we are getting into deep trouble.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that the hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire (Mr. Barnes) was going to develop the associated point about the discrepancy between what the Ordnance Survey says about land and what the Land Registry says. That should be tackled outwith the subject of my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0645">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
We should include in the Bill the goal of completion of land registration and the completion of the Land Registry's records. We should set a date for it; one that would no longer leave us shamed by the achievements of Victorian clerks. Perhaps December 2003 or 2004 would be appropriate. The Bill is well capable of bearing such alteration since it is intended in principle to deal with the issue of unregistered land, but it does not do so, whether by recognising the extent of it, by recognising the fact that our ancestors remedied the problem in short order or by recognising the huge importance of the issue to the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon and you, Mr. Hancock, in another guise at a party conference, will know only too well the chorus of a song called "The Land":
	<br><blockquote><p>"Why should we be beggars with a ballot in our hand, God gave the land for the people."</p></blockquote>
If we cannot all share in the ownership of that land, can we not at least know who does, and on an equitable basis?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.47 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been a fascinating foray into the byways of 19th century history, as well as being very constructive. I am grateful to Opposition Members for acknowledging the enormous contribution made by the people whom I have already thanked for their work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reassure the hon. Member for Stone that although it will make no difference to him, his successors will, in doing conveyancing exams, be spared the vast consumption of Neurofen because of the Bill. I do not say that the proposals may not be capable of improvement. The debate has thrown up issues that we shall clearly have to tease out further in Committee, but I hope that the Committee shares the view that the policy aim of greater transparency in the property market is a good one—I expect that even the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) agrees about that— and that the Bill is a suitable vehicle for achieving that and a major contribution to law reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal relatively briefly with the many and various points that have been made. I hope that I shall cover all of them. The hon. Member for Stone made an important point about impostors and the use of electronic signatures. I am aware of widespread concern about security in that context, which has been extensively debated in another place. It is worth stating for the record that paper systems are not immune to security problems either. The ability to audit when and where electronic signatures are made will in many respects make them more secure than paper systems. With all such systems the technology and the systems used are equally important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is clearly one of the issues of greatest concern that has arisen in relation to the Bill. It is always aired when matters of electronic commerce are brought to the House. The Bill provides a remedy, I hope, to such concerns, in that people who have innocently suffered loss may receive an indemnity from the registry. I hope that that goes some way towards reassuring the hon. Gentleman, for the time being. I shall be happy to return to the matter later if necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
The hon. Gentleman's point about the length of registrable leases was probably the matter that took up most time in the discussion of the Bill in another place. As to the likelihood of the Land Registry being able to cope, the land registrar has given an unequivocal reassurance that it can cope with leases of seven years and probably less, without reducing the high standards of service that it offers. I shall come back to other points to do with the length of registrable leases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to address the issue of cost. Although I understand the hon. Gentleman's concerns, in articulating them he has not given us the whole picture. My officials have met the Country Landowners Association and have dealt with, or at least reduced, its concerns. The critical point is that although the reduction from 21 to seven years will involve additional costs—the conveyancer will have more work to do and there will be Land Registry fees—those are relatively minor in relation to the total cost of the lease, even for relatively small value leases for small businesses, let alone to the commercial value of the transaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it is to be expected that well organised conveyancers will prepare material for registration as they go along, we estimate that less than an hour's work will be involved in preparing an application. The registry's typical fee for a commercial short lease is of the order of £100. Even for the largest transactions involving millions of pounds, the maximum fee is £800. Those are the costs, bit it is worth pointing out that that is spending to save. Unregistered conveyancing transactions are significantly more complicated than those drawn up under the simpler, more certain law applying to registered transactions in which the name and title of existing or intermediate leaseholders and the quality of their title is easier to establish, as is the identity and quality of the title of the freeholder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the conveyancing transaction remains a paper one, it should be much faster. It is conservatively estimated that some two and a half hours could be saved on each transaction. Every subsequent transaction involving the lease is saved all the complex work that is unnecessary once the lease has been registered. That will be of enormous benefit to business, particularly to small businesses on which such costs can bear heavily, as they have done in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also raised the question of confidentiality. All experience with the freehold residential market shows that the more reliable and neutral information about the market and its development that is publicly available, the better. I am sure that the hon. Member for Torbay will agree with me. The rules in this area, which will be subject to consultation, will follow the policy behind the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Under that Act, the presumption is to supply a copy of the document unless it falls within one of two exceptions. The two that are relevant to land registration are commercial confidentiality and data protection. Those exceptions will be built into the rules. It is not intended to make leases and charges exceptions as classes. I hope that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0646">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
that provides some reassurance for the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon made a point about giving notice of first registration to adjoining land. However, there are practical problems that mitigate against what is otherwise an interesting suggestion. It will not always be clear on whom notice is to be served, even when land is registered. When it is not registered, the registry will obviously have no record at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the Minister's point. Nevertheless there is a system in planning law under which one posts a notice for something like 28 days that could possibly draw to the attention of the owner of adjoining, unregistered land the fact that the land is to be compulsorily registered for the first time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give the hon. Gentleman an undertaking to look carefully at that and return to him. There might be a way forward, or there could be practical problems. He also made a point about the verification of copy documents. As he knows, copy documents are generally certified by solicitors or licensed conveyancers, but the Land Registry will accept certification by officers at banks, building societies and other similar bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made a point about those who transgress. The Land Registry works closely with the profession and will offer any firm in such circumstances the opportunity to improve its performance through the use of Land Registry expertise. Only in extreme cases would a report to the professional body be considered. He also asked about the accountability of the adjudicator, who will be a judicial officer accountable only to a higher court. The Lord Chancellor will make the appointment and a competition will be launched shortly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his reply on the initial points that I made on the proposed adjudicator. Will there be oral hearings as well as written submissions? Will a cost element be involved as well?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman has already divined, the answer to both those questions is yes. He was concerned that the jurisdiction of the courts would not be ousted, which is the case. The Bill expressly provides that a person may appeal against a decision by the adjudicator to the High Court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about the status of fees and the basis behind their charging. As is the case for other Government fees, the Land Registry aims only to cover the cost of its services and a 6 per cent. return on the average capital employed. For a variety of reasons over time, a surplus has built up. It is relatively small in relation to the total of the transactions, and some of it is being used to build on the impressive technological improvements that the registry has been engaged on for some time. He asked a specific question, so I shall ask the Department to consider more carefully the past five years and I shall write to him with precise figures for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
Another issue that the hon. Gentleman asked about was maladministration and fees in such circumstances. When maladministration occurs, the Land Registry has discretion to make ex gratia payments to cover the applicants costs and the fees paid. He mentioned Lord Goodhart's amendments with some approval. Another place considered them at length, and it is probably best to return to them at a later stage. I will undertake to consider them again but, so far, the Government have not been convinced by them. The hon. Gentleman also asked when it would be possible to access the land charges register electronically, but that is already possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire (Mr. Barnes) raised some concerns that several colleagues will have experienced in their constituencies. I reassure him that the Bill will help to deal with many of them. He asked what the registry could do to make the fixing of a boundary easier and cheaper. There are procedures for applying to the registry for boundaries, but they are not much used. Mapping technology changes all the time. In years to come, a cheaper and less time-consuming method of fixing boundaries may be practicable. The power to fix has been included in the Bill, so advantage can be taken of any relevant technological developments in future. Anyone who visits a land registry can see the enormous steps forward that have been taken in a relatively short time. Given the speed at which technology changes, I hope that we will see real change in the not-so-distant future. In time, that technology will help to reduce problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend may be interested to note that the Bill will enable boundaries to be fixed by the registry so that any dispute can be decided, which will resolve difficulties once and for all. He also alluded to the problem of destroyed deeds. Electronic storage makes such problems much less pressing. Inevitably, it will reduce the risk of essential documents being destroyed irrevocably by fire or any other means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We then had an interesting contribution from the hon. Member for Torbay, who raised several political and technical points. He had an interesting construction on the European convention on human rights, which had not automatically occurred to me. Despite his eloquence, I am minded to disagree with him on that interpretation. We must put his concern into context. Despite his strong statement at the beginning of his speech, by the end I felt that he was edging towards us, increasingly perceiving the value of our proposals for creating greater transparency. I understand his desire to see all land registered, but we should put that in context. More than 80 per cent. of titles are registered. We have already heard from the hon. Member for Stone about some of the powers, about increasing compulsion—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sanders</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It sounds wonderful to say that 80 per cent. of titles have been registered. However, those titles do not represent 80 per cent. of the land. Vast tracts of our nation are owned without the title being registered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but we must examine the issue in context. We are specifically discussing powers to compel, and I will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0647">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
go on to explain why we are not taking those powers. We must accept and agree that the far greater transparency that the Bill will introduce into the property and land markets will make the advantages of registration so compelling that in time the Bill will achieve everything that the hon. Gentleman wants. He will no doubt ask me why, if the measures are so exciting and advantageous, we do not simply take those powers to compel immediately. As the hon. Member for Stone said, there is already concern in another place about the powers given to the Lord Chancellor to compel under the Bill. No doubt we will return to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to give the hon. Member for Torbay some other reasons why we should be wary of taking up his suggestion. First, we believe that it would be premature to take such powers. The Land Registration Act 1997 significantly extended the requirements for first registration. Its provisions are broadly reproduced in the Bill, the changes have only recently started to have effect and the Bill will offer considerable additional benefits. As I have said, we believe that there will be a significant rise in voluntary first registration as a result. As a matter of general principle—I hope that the hon. Member for Stone is able to agree with me—compulsion should be employed only when it is clearly needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A thought occurred to me while the Minister was speaking, but I doubt that he will be able to answer immediately. A host of private Acts deal, for example, with the New Forest, where land is subject to ancient rules of perambulation, piscary and herbage. I do not want to make things unduly complicated, but perhaps the Minister's advisers might consider clause 3(1), which refers to "an interest" such as
	<br><blockquote><p>"a profit a prendre in gross".</p></blockquote>
There are other such interests, including riparian owners' rights and the whole question of internal waters. There is some interesting material, which we do not need to go into now but which should be taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an issue for the Committee stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is to be congratulated on spotting that I am not at present cited with respect to the prime lands the New forest— but I will be. That will be looked into.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to try to reassure the hon. Member for Torbay about the matter of compulsion. First, such powers should be taken only when it is clear that they
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
are needed. We think that they may well not be needed. Let us see how the legislation beds down. Secondly, compulsory registration is triggered at present by dispositions of unregistered land. It is not easy to devise a system of compulsory registration of title other than one that operates on a disposition of the land in question. The mechanisms of compulsion in such situations are not self-evident. There are dangers that any system could be heavy handed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised the question of the European convention on human rights. Self-evidently, under the convention and under the Human Rights Act 1998, the means must be proportionate to the desired ends. It is not clear in the context in question how that could be the case other than with a disposition of the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, although the Land Registry has given us the reassurance that it can cope with bringing leases of seven years or thereabouts into the parameters of registration, that is likely to be demanding on both the conveyancing profession and the Land Registry for some years after the introduction of the measure. It would perhaps stretch them too far to include compulsory registration at the same time. However, I give him this comfort: both the royal commission and the Land Registry have recommended that the working of the Bill should be reviewed five years after implementation to assess what more needs to be done. We are not closing the door on the matter. We need to consider it in the round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have reached the end of Second Reading. We have had a useful, constructive and interesting debate. Clearly issues remain to be discussed and, I hope, resolved to the satisfaction of all members of the Committee. The Bill is technical, as everyone has noted, but it is enormously significant. It is often said that the three most stressful events in life are a death in the family, a divorce and moving house. Governments can unfortunately do nothing about the first and little about the second, but we can do something about the third. The Bill will make life much easier for everyone involved in all transactions to do with property. That must be welcomed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
