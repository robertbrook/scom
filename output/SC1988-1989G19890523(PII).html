	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I ask the Minister to move the first amendment formally, I am sure that the Committee would like to know that arrangements have now been made for us to meet in the Grand Committee Room when we return from the Whitsun recess. We shall meet in this Room on Thursday. I am grateful to

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause provides transitional relief to prevent income earned before the introduction of the receipts basis being taxed twice, once when earned before 6 April 1989 and again when received after 5 April 1989. It does so, when relief is claimed, by reducing the emoluments chargeable under case I or II for years before 1989–90 when they are received after 5 April 1989, and by providing that they should be charged instead only under the new basis for the year of receipt. It includes provisions designed to prevent taxpayers normally assessed on a receipts basis, or on the non-statutory accounts basis, from obtaining entitlement, or increased entitlement, to transitional relief by having their earnings for 1988–89 assessed on the strict statutory earnings basis. That is to say that a person cannot move from the accounts basis to the earnings
	<span class='label label-info column'>194</span>
basis to prolong the transitional period. We have already discussed the rationale of the measure and the following two clauses also bear on it in the converse sense of preventing incomes slipping out of the tax net as opposed to being taxed twice. The transitional relief works in both directions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is needed to preserve the existing charge on certain overseas income remitted to the United Kingdom after 5 April 1989.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present case III applies when income is received in the United Kingdom whenever it is earned. The new case III, like the other cases introduced by the clause, applies only to earnings for 1989–90 and later years. Therefore, without this clause income received in the UK after 5 April 1989—which should be chargeable on the receipts basis—would be excluded if it were earned for a period before 6 April 1989. The clause thus blocks a loophole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 36 provides transitional relief designed to ensure that the same earnings are not assessed twice, once on the old basis and once on the new. Clause 38 deals with the obverse where earnings chargeable to tax under the restated cases of schedule E would, but for this clause, fail to be assessable for any year because they were received before the new receipts basis came into force. The clause prevents
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0117">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>195</span>
such income from being outside both old and new rules by deeming it to be received on 6 April 1989, therefore assessable for 1989–90. If the earnings are chargeable under case III of schedule E, but received in the United Kingdom before 5 April 1989, the clause similarly deems them to have been received in the United Kingdom on 6 April 1989, therefore assessable for 1989–90.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 141, in page 29, line 2, leave out from "made" to "for" in line 4 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"of profits or gains which are to be charged under Schedule D and are".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 143, 145 and 147.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clauses 40 and 41 achieve the same end. Clause 41 relates to investment and insurance companies. Clause 40 contains consequential changes for employers following the introduction of the receipts basis. The clause provides that where remuneration is still unpaid nine months after the period of account in which it was earned and for which it was charged, it is not deductible in arriving at the taxable profits of the employer for that period, but instead shall be deducted in arriving at the profits for the period in which it is paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present all employees' remuneration is deductible by the employer for tax purposes for the period of account in which it is earned and for which it is charged. The employee is correspondingly assessed to tax on that remuneration for the tax year in which he earned it. There is therefore a link at present between the assessment of earnings on the employee and the relief to the employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
However, when we move to the new receipts basis, that link will be broken, as the employee will be taxed only when he receives the remuneration. It is necessary to have a new rule to limit the extent to which assessment on the employee, and relief to the employer, can get out of step. Without the provisions, an employer could obtain a deduction for remuneration which was allocated to an employee but which remained unpaid for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As long as the remuneration is unpaid, the employee cannot be taxed under schedule E. Arrangements of that type could be created where, for example, the employee is a close relative of the employer. This will interest the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown). In this way, the employer could reduce his own tax liability although he has spent nothing and there is no corresponding schedule E liability. That would clearly be unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The great majority of cases in which remuneration is paid shortly after it is earned will not be affected by the provision. Where there is some delay in paying remuneration, we are allowing nine months after the end of a business's period of account within which remuneration can be paid and still be deducted in the normal way. That should allow for any reasonable delay and means that postponement of the deduction will happen very rarely. But where there is exceptional delay, it is only reasonable that, if the business has not paid the employee and still has the benefit of the money, it should not be able to claim tax relief until the remuneration is paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee knows, not many businesses are able to provide their accounts and tax computations within nine months of their accounting date, so most will be able to reflect the remuneration position accurately when they submit computations of their tax liability. But to allow for employers who may be in a position to prepare and submit their accounts and tax computations to the inspector in less than nine months after the end of their accounting period, the clauses provide that remuneration that is unpaid when the computation is made shall not be allowed in computing the profits for tax purposes but, if any of that is subsequently paid within the nine months, a claim can be made for the computation to be adjusted to allow the remuneration. Therefore, the effect is to get the deduction on the employer's side and the tax on the employee's side in step, subject to the nine-month limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment Nos. 141, 143, 145 and 147 are technical. They make it clear that the calculations to which the rules apply are all calculations of taxable profits made in accordance with the schedule D rules that apply to individuals, partnerships and companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the second group, amendments Nos. 142, 144 and 146 ensure that the rules apply to all the types of earnings—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not discussing those amendments. But, if it is for the general convenience of the Committee, I do not mind taking all the amendments together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it may be for the convenience of the Committee, Mr. Cormack.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, and given my mood of benign tolerance this evening, that is fine. Therefore, with the first group of amendments we shall also take Government amendments Nos. 142, 144, 146, 149, 153 and 155.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for that, Mr. Cormack. This is an extremely simple and short point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 142, 144 and 146 ensure that the rules apply to all the types of earnings that the employer will or may pay. It is possible that the employer will charge in his accounts a global sum that will be paid to his employees, although at the end of the accounting year the precise allocation to each employee might not have been decided. As originally drafted, clause 40(1)(b) would apply the rules only to emoluments for a particular office or employment, and not to cases when the emoluments related to a group of employees and the allocation had not been decided at the end of the employer's accounting period, or when the emoluments were payable only on the happening of some contingency. The amendments ensure that the clause also applies to such cases and thus gives effect to the intention that the rules should apply to all deductions claimed in respect of remuneration that is still unpaid nine months after the accounting date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that, in response to what appeared to be a unanimous request, I agreed that the two groups of amendments would be taken as one group.

In moving the amendment, I declare an interest as a Lloyd's underwriter. I have been asked to limit my remarks to an hour and a half! I shall start by saying that the amendment is designed to allow the clause to cater for the corporation of Lloyd's and its three-year accounting rule as it applies to underwriting agents.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that my hon. Friend the Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) has alighted on a real problem.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because of the fact, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Wanstead and Woodford referred, that Lloyd's operates on a three-year accounting basis.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to be unaware that the three-year basis on which Lloyd's operates is already recognised in the tax system. Many industries have their own peculiarities and special tax laws, for example, the insurance industry generally, the composite insurance industry and the life insurance industry. We have to adapt the laws that we bring before the House to cope with each industry. Lloyd's is an important industry and we are familiar with its three-year accounting period. The fact is that the receipts basis, as drafted, does not take account of the peculiarities of Lloyd's. Therefore, it is common sense to make a marginal adjustment to the legislation to cope with that important business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said before when we discussed clause 40, it was designed to stop the deduction on the employers side getting out of step with tax on the employees side. Clause 41 does exactly the same for investment and insurance companies.

Amendments Nos. 150, 151, 152 and 156 are technical amendments. They replace, where appropriate, the phrase "period of account" with the phrase "accounting period". Profits for corporation tax purposes are calculated by reference to accounting periods as defined in tax legislation. It is therefore appropriate for the Bill to refer to an accounting period in connection with profits liable to corporation tax. However, when fixing the deadline which determines when a deduction is to be due it is necessary to focus on the period for which the company actually draws up its accounts, which is called the period of account. The company may have a 15-month accounting period, for example. That is
	<span class='label label-info column'>200</span>
why it is necessary to distinguish between a period of account and an accounting period. The amendments recognise the distinction between the two phrases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Cormack. It is regrettable, as you said earlier, that two selection lists seem to be floating about, each containing a different set of groupings. I drew to the attention of the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) the fact that I had not referred to amendment No. 149, although the amendments in the grouping were consequential and I should simply have repeated what I said on earlier amendments agreed to clause 40—that the amendments ensured that the rules introduced by the clause applied to all types of deduction that an

As I said before, the company may charge in its accounts a global sum to be paid to employees, although at the end of the accounting year the precise allocation for each employee may not have been decided. I know that the hon. Gentleman was listening closely, so he may recall that that was what I said about the earlier group of amendments. The second set is a set of provisions parallel to those on clause 40, simply applying to a different clause. I am sorry if that was not made clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not do that, Mr. Cormack, but lest these points seem pedantic, it is fair to remind the Committee that on Second Reading, the Chairman of the Treasury and Civil Service Committee said that this Committee would be unable to discharge its duties because of the wealth of detail involved in the Bill. When we debated the sittings motion, which seems like 100 years ago, but was only just a couple of weeks, I said specifically that the Opposition would make measured and thorough progress on the Bill but would not miss an opportunity to ensure that its provisions were fully and satisfactorily explored. I made that point, and it is probably just coincidence that that was omitted from

Last week, I allowed considerable latitude towards starred amendments as it was important that Government amendments should be adequately debated—with amendments to those amendments—so exceptionally, I allowed certain things to happen.

Exceptionally tonight, I have allowed what, in effect, has been a slightly generous interpretation of the point of order procedure to enable the hon.

I cannot allow that to happen again, so I ask members of the Committee to look extremely carefully at the groupings, from which it is clear that Government amendment No. 149 was grouped with the others. It appeared to be the unanimous request of the Committee for that major grouping to appear, so it is incumbent on hon. Members to look at the grouping. If a Minister, or anyone else, has omitted
	<span class='label label-info column'>202</span>
to refer to one of those amendments, and others believe that omission to be significant, the matter should be raised before the debate is concluded.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->

Accordingly, the clause specifies, for the purposes of PAYE, when payments of, or on account of, schedule E income are to be regarded as made. The definition is essentially the same as the definition of receipts in clause 35.

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause sets the limit on loans qualifying for mortgage interest relief at £30,000 for 1989–90—the same as for 1988–89. The same limit applies to certain loans to elderly people to purchase life annuities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>9.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The limit set by the clause suggests that the Government have reservations about mortgage interest tax relief, otherwise they would have been more willing to increase the threshold over the years. It is clear that mortgage interest tax relief is a mixed blessing. Its justification must be that it is a means of assisting people to home ownership. If it fails to do so, it is a candidate for reform. However, the removal of such reliefs would be severely to the detriment of many people who took out loans for the purpose of home ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause leads me to ask yet again why, if the purpose of the relief is to assist people to buy homes, it should be given at the higher rate of tax, not the basic rate? Reference has already been made to that earlier in our proceedings. Had the relief granted under the provision been restricted to the basic rate, there would have been a saving to the Exchequer of £330 million in 1988–89 out of a total expenditure of £5.5 billion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sum of £330 million may not be enormous, but Treasury Ministers are keen to save such sums in respect of many other issues. Therefore, it is reasonable for us to press on the Government the desirability of limiting the relief to the basic rate of tax. If not, it will involve a high level of public subsidy for those who can afford not to have such a subsidy and for whom the justification that the provision will benefit people socially and assist them on the route to home ownership cannot apply. Will the Minister reconsider the higher rate of relief under the provision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) spoke to the amendment in respect of not only mortgage relief, but every allowance. He made clear his view, and that of his party, that relief for mortgage interest should be restricted to the basic rate. We have not adopted that approach on mortgage relief, nor is it one that we adopt on allowances generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite what was said earlier, we have a more progressive system of income tax that hon. Members are willing to recognise. They sometimes confuse the burden or lightness of the tax with its progressivity. But the nature of a progressive income tax is that relief should be allowed at the higher rate as well as the basic rate of tax. The issue is a straightforward division between the parties. We have heard the hon. Gentleman's argument before, and we are not persuaded of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This probing amendment seeks to draw the Government's attention to the attitude of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders Limited. It has been at some pains to demonstrate its support for the principle of tax benefits in respect of cars. It also favours the general thrust of the Government's policy of fiscal neutrality and the economic policy bearing down on inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the SMMT is worried that the taxable benefits scales set out in clause 46 and in schedule 6
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0122">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>205</span>
of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 have an unbalanced effect. That gives rise to an insufficient tax benefit on the perk car—the car that is given by businesses but which is principally, if not wholly, used for private use. The tables also bear down too heavily on those who have cars for habitual business use, such as sales representatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, it is argued that the charges are not reasonably based. Even the Automobile Association has pointed that out in one of its briefings. The charges have not been reasonably based in relation to their value of benefit, and the suggestion is that it might be more practical to take contract hire rates into account, as a better basis for calculation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there should be provision for relating the increase in the flat rate cash equivalent to the retail price index, and for the original market values to increase in line with the annual rate of inflation. In my view, the proposals have considerable merit and I ask the Treasury Ministers to consider carefully whether they could make some variation to reflect the genuine concerns of the SMMT.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. John Marek 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition are perplexed about the scale charges. We do not disapprove of the scale charges relating to the perk car. If I understood the hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) correctly, we agree that the person who uses the car mainly as a perk and very little for business use is still not being taxed enough. A person who has an expensive car, such as a BMW, Rolls-Royce or Mercedes limousine costing £50,000, is not being taxed anywhere near enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The onus is on the Government to explain to the sales rep who might have a 1400cc car, or to the health visitor or district nurse who uses a car as a tool of the trade—as opposed to a perk—that the scale of taxation is right. If it is not right, it should be amended in a future Finance Bill—I am under no illusion that we shall make changes in the present Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Problems have arisen from last year's Finance Bill. The AA has not been asked for advice, although its figures have been taken into consideration. The AA was not asked how it made up its figures for the cost of cars, upon which a judgment is made about the level of car tax scale that should be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Paymaster General be more transparent about the figures that the Treasury uses to make up the scales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point that by my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek), will the Paymaster General expand on the Treasury's attitude to car benefit?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all recognise the difference between the perk car and the car that is an indispensable tool of the trade. My hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham cited the examples of nurses and salesmen. Other people are awarded cars, but that has nothing to do with travelling from A to B, and much to do with increasing their salary or social prestige in the company. Through taxation we must ensure that anyone who uses a car as a tool of his trade is never
	<span class='label label-info column'>206</span>
at a loss or discomforted in any way because of that. There should be no cause for the person who is awarded a perk to be on other than a level playing field in relation to taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was interesting to note that the Henley Centre for Forecasting said that on the basis of 1989–89 figures
	<br><blockquote><p>"there would have to be a five-fold rise in taxation on most company car users before the tax advantage was entirely lost."</p></blockquote>
That was before the latest increase was put in by the Chancellor. We must also take into account that in previous years the company car was used to defend the British car industry as it was seen as a fleet car which gave it considerable support. However, I believe that that idea has changed considerably because of where cars are now asssembled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Paymaster General another question. We are all conscious that the Budget is used for such social engineering purposes as the distribution of wealth or to encourage people to use unleaded petrol. It is clear that the transport system of the country is under considerable pressure and I recall that it was said that about 70 per cent. of the cars that come into London each day are company cars carrying one passenger. That considerably increases the costs to British industry and the taxpayer in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Paymaster General to tell us what consultations have taken place between the Treasury and the Department of Transport about the influence of taxation policy on transport policy. An increase in capital expenditure on roads has been announced by the Department of Transport, but at the same time there are constant inducements for people to use company cars on the roads. That means that a group of people receives a benefit at a cost to the rest of us who also have to pay out far more for the provision of extra roads.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. John Townend 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridlington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For one group of car users, the tax charge is too heavy. I refer to those representatives who drive long distances around the country, and when many of those people come home at the weekends they do not want to go out again driving their company cars. The latest increases impose far too heavy a burden on that restricted section of the community. I agree that it is right and proper to tax a perk because tax rates have come down, but I ask my hon. Friend the Paymaster General to examine the case of the professional representatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Each of the previous two speeches made a valid point. On the one hand, the person who uses a car as a perk may drive to work and back from Guildford or a leafy suburb in Surrey. If that person lives 30 miles away from London and uses his car five days a week, he will clock up nearly 15,000 miles a year. He uses his car as a perk because he could use public transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, the short speech of the hon. Member for Bridlington (Mr. Townend) was right. A representative who drives his car 20,000 miles or more a year is probably fed up with a steering wheel by Friday night. Cannot the rules discriminate

betweeen those two classes of users to accommodate those persons who use cars as a tool of their trade?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am somewhat in ignorance of the circumstances because I am not sure on what basis the Government create their figures. However, it looks to us as if the figure of about 10 per cent. or 20 per cent. for health visitors, district nurses or tool-of-the-trade sales representatives, is right. What we can say definitely is that the man or woman who is using the car as a perk, and has a valuable car, is still getting away without paying a great deal of tax that he or she should be paying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The availability of a company car for private use is well recognised as a valuable and widespread benefit, and the system of taxing it is familiar to the Committee. Since it is right in principle that a person's income, whether it is received in cash or in kind, should be fully taxed, the scale charges should be so set as to reflect the value of the benefits to the employee. I think that there is common cause across the Committee there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having a car provided by an employer relieves the employee of the fixed costs, and many of the running costs, involved in providing a car himself for his private use. It has been widely recognised that the scale charges have been set well below the value of the private benefit of a company car. Accordingly, for a number of years the Government have increased the scale charges at more than the rate of inflation in order to bring them to more realistic levels. In last year's Budget, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor, in line with that policy, doubled the scale charges. The hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) and I exchanged parliamentary question and answer about those calculations. My right hon. Friend made it clear that the undervaluation could not be remedied in a single year; that to some extent answers the question asked by the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) about the process that the Government are following.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year my right hon. Friend proposed a more modest increase of one third on the value of a company car for private use assessed on any reasonable basis. To limit the increases to some 8 to 10 per cent., as my hon. Friend the Member for Esher seeks in his amendments, would not properly tackle the under-taxation in this area. As the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek), I think, acknowledged, the intention was to increase the taxation by an appropriate amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>208</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Esher mentioned the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, and various questions were asked about that body. The SMMT argues that the most appropriate method for setting the scale charges is to use average contract hire rates, together with such items of expenditure as insurance, for cars within each scale band, and charge to tax a proportion of those costs based on average total mileage for each business mileage category. The Committee is familiar with the three categories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although contract hire is an increasingly popular method used by employers to provide cars for their employees, most employers buy and maintain cars themselves, so the argument for using only contract hire data is not strong. In any event, the difference between contract hire-based figures for the cost to the employer of providing a car, and figures that have been produced by various motoring organisations and related bodies, for the costs to an individual, is not great.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apportionment between business and private mileage is a more significant question. On the basis of its figure for business and private mileage, the SMMT believes that while further substantial increases in the scales this year could be justified for what it describes as perk cars—where there is little or no business use—it thought that only minor increases would be justified for other cars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures proposed this year do not exceed those on the SMMT approach if the latest National Travel Survey figures for the private and total mileage of company cars are used, but that does not mean that the Government accept the SMMT's argument. The Government's argument is that the car scales still undervalue the benefit and no final decision has been made on the appropriate long-term basis of the scale charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bridlington (Mr. Townend) and other Opposition Members asked about tool-of-the-trade cars. A common criticism of the scale charge system is that it makes an inadequate distinction between cars with heavy business mileage and cars that are essentially a perk, to which the SMMT referred. On the contrary, the present differential is sharp. Cars doing 18,000 business miles or more are charged only one third as much as cars doing 2,500 business miles or less. That is arguably generous, as the scales charge the benefit of the availability of the car for private use, although most private use takes place outside working hours—between home and work, in the evenings, at weekends and on holiday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It must be a pretty poor executive who cannot get up to the minimum threshold for private mileage. The Paymaster General should not make too much of that point.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Three quarters of the cars fall in the band between 2,500 and 18,000; 18 per cent. are in the higher band, and 7 per cent. fail to achieve the objective to which the hon. Gentleman refers. In the example that I adduced, I compared 18 per cent. with 7 per cent. That is not an unreasonable comparison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0124">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>209</span>
I was saying that available evidence suggests that private mileage in company cars does not vary significantly with business mileage, despite what my hon. Friend the Member for Bridlington said, and despite, inevitably, some anecdotal evidence. So the present differential is already greater than that which is justified strictly on the facts. I acknowledge that it is part of the mythology that Ministers have taken insufficient account, or are not aware, of the difference between the perk car and the tool-of-the-trade car, but I assure the Committee that we have looked at the matter closely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Wrexham implied, there is some evidence of unnecessary business mileage being incurred to meet the threshold at 2,500 and at 18,000 miles. Some outside organisations pose environmental objections to the fact that that incentive exists, but to move the thresholds into the middle ground where they would be material for a much larger number of employees than now meet the two extremes, which would be an alternative solution, would tend to make the problems worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now refer to the speech of the hon. Member for Wrexham. This is not the year for structural changes to the scales, or for changes in relativities. The one third increase is a significant general step to remove under-taxation in this year's broad budgetary context. I shall return to the point made by the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie in a moment. As scales move towards full valuation, we shall need to give careful consideration to those more detailed matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the bases of valuation, a range of possible approaches to valuing the benefit of having a company car available for private use is taken into account in setting the scale charges. We particularly bear in mind the extent of typical private mileage and have considered motoring cost figures produced by independent bodies. The figures include contract hire costs in order to give us a general picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essence of the policy is that we recognise that there is under taxation, and we do not believe that we can reach full taxation at a stroke. The exercise must take place in a series of stages. In the past two years, the stages have been large.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On consultation between the Department of Transport and the Treasury, there has effectively been none. We are seeking fiscal neutrality without imposing social engineering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Townend</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When my hon. Friend talks about under taxation, does he mean that the category of people who do over 18,000 miles a year—for example, representatives who do 25,000 to 30,000 miles a year—is undertaxed with the present assessment of benefit in kind? The general feeling of people in that small category is that they are overtaxed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend knows, for people in that category the benefit is treated at one third of the highest level.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>210</span>

This amendment is a plea on behalf of community nurses. They and their representative organisation, the Royal College of Nursing, are worried about the effect of the scale increase on the community nurses, health visitors and similar professionals who use cars in the course of their work, but who are not paid at high levels. The cars belong to the district health authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such people are important for a health policy moving towards community care. One of the consequences of that is the need for more health professionals, especially community nurses, to visit and care for people at home. The community nurses are in the car tax net because they are classed as what until this year were called higher-paid employees subject to the £8,500 threshold. If that figure were uprated in line with current prices, it would be nearer £18,000 than £8,500.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Community nurses, unlike some people with company cars, are employed by district health authorities which do not regard the car as a perk or an additional benefit. Arrangements for the use of the car are far more rigorous—one might say parsimonious—than those fixed by a company which sees the car as a means of giving the employee a better deal. Community nurses and the related professions pay a charge for the private mileage that they do. Even on low private mileage they pay about £400 or £500 in charges for the private use of the motor car. They would be in a better position if that were not so. If they were not charged and were simply taxed on the full benefit instead of being charged and having that charge deducted from the amount on which they are taxed, they would be financially better off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0125">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>211</span>
An alternative route to dealing with the problem which causes such anxiety would be for the Treasury to persuade the health authorities that they should not impose such a charge. But as long as the charge exists, it involves community nurses in what seems to them to be a very expensive deal for the occasional, limited private use of a motor car which is, in the language that we used earlier, very much the tool of their trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As though the scale charge on the car were not enough, many community nurses also lose out on petrol costs because under Whitley council provisions, nurses are reimbursed their petrol expenditure according to manufacturers' published urban cycle miles per gallon rates. But the nature of their work, making calls at one house after the other, tends to mean that they are always stopping and starting the car. Therefore, they are unlikely to achieve the mileage rates which the manufacturers talk about so enthusiastically. Any manufacturer is inclined to stick as rigorously as possible to the provisions which make the mileage look good. They do not involve the kind of stopping and starting which is involved in the community nurses' normal activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers should be aware that community nurses feel it rather a hardship to be linked with those for whom a car is a perk, particularly those paid at much higher levels. I therefore invite Ministers to look again at the matter and to consider it in the context of health policy, which is dedicated to extending community care and making full use of the services of these excellent people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether we can lend our support to the amendment. However, although I do not propose to repeat what I said under the previous amendment, we feel that the spirit behind this amendment should be investigated by the Government to ensure that health visitors, as essential car users, district nurses and community nurses are not being charged too much for their mileage. Will the Paymaster General tell us whether there is evidence that more pool cars are being used in the Health Service or that more loans and mileage payments are being offered by the district health authorities? If that is the case, the Government may need to consider seriously whether the scale charges for nurses have now become too high and need to be reviewed. I do not know; it is a question of seeking information and asking the Paymaster General to provide some details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

However, we are clear that on the basis of taxation, we cannot exempt one group of people from the charges. For that reason, I do not think we could follow the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) if he pressed the amendment to a Division. Having said that, however, we want to be assured that the charges on such people are not too onerous—[

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to be able to respond, without pressure of time, to amendment No. 172. The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) seeks to exempt nurses, midwives and health visitors from the car benefit and car fuel benefit scale charges which apply generally to employees who have business cars provided by their employers for their private use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wrexham acknowledged that it was right in principle that employees should be subject to the same rules. As I said on the previous amendment, it is right that employees should pay tax on the whole of their earnings, whether they are in cash or kind. Having a car available for private use is a valuable benefit. No case has been made this evening for a particular group of employees to have special treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the principle, if the hon. Gentleman examined his amendment with care he would acknowledge that if it were accepted other health authority workers, such as radiographers, physiotherapists, doctors or social workers, might think that they should enjoy the same arrangements. If levels of income as against the purpose of the employment were considered, service engineers, the junior salesmen to whom my hon. Friend the Member for Bridlington referred, or ministers of religion would come into the same category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, any proposal along these lines inevitably leads to such invidious distinctions. Once special treatment has been granted to a particular group, however deserving, others would be encouraged to press their own claims which would be more difficult to resist once the car benefit charge was no longer generally applied. The amendment was urged in the name of fairness, but it would make the tax rules not only more complex but less fair. That is certainly how those who still had to pay the tax would see it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had the benefit of seeing a copy of the letter on car benefits from the Royal College of Nursing. It founded its argument for special treatment on two points. First, community nurses are already required to make a contribution to the private use of their cars. Secondly, the development of community care is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
District nurses and other community health workers are not the only employees whose employers require them to make a contribution towards the private use of their cars. The real point at issue is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0126">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>213</span>
that the Royal College believes that contributions of £400 or £500 a year fully value the benefit of having a health authority car available for private use. The Government do not share that view; nor do many, even within this Committee, who have to bear the full cost of a car. Independent studies show that the value of the private benefit of a car is way above that figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be the first to acknowledge the contribution of those in community care. But the hon. Gentleman has not made a case for the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that Members of Parliament, like other members of the general public, meet the costs of a car. They have a clear idea of the maintenance costs of that car.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question asked by the hon. Member for Wrexham, we suspect that there is a move away from the use of private cars and mileage rates to providing business cars. If nurses use pool cars that have no private use, no scale charge arises. Many employees make substantial contributions to the private use of cars, especially, but not uniquely, in the public sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>SECURITY ASSETS AND SERVICES</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clauses 47, 48 and 49 provide an exemption from the benefits in kind charge which might otherwise arise where an employer provides personal physical security facilities for an employee who is under a special threat to his security by virtue of his employment. That relief is matched by equivalent reliefs for self-employed taxpayers in clauses 111, 112, 118 and 119.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relief is of limited application and prevents charges to tax, chiefly under the benefits in kind
	<span class='label label-info column'>214</span>
rules, in certain exceptional circumstances. The Government recognise that for some employees the particular work on which they are engaged may mean that they are exposed to a threat to their personal security from terrorists and other groups who resort to violence. In the face of such a threat, employers may incur expenditure in seeking to protect their employees. Where such expenditure results in a tax charge on the employee, the Government intend that it should be relieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The benefits in kind legislation, which applies to those who earn £8,500 a year or more, is widely drawn so as to charge tax on
	<br><blockquote><p>"benefits or facilities of whatsoever kind"</p></blockquote>
provided to employees by virture of their employment. Similarly, where expenses are reimbursed to employees by employers, a tax charge normally arises which can be relieved only if the underlying expense is itself
	<br><blockquote><p>"wholly exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties"</p></blockquote>
of the employment; that is a deliberately stiff test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It follows that where security facilities are provided for employees outside the workplace, a tax charge—possibly a substantial one—would be the normal result. That would apply even where there was no intention on the part of the employer to remunerate or reward his employee in incurring the expenditure, or where the "benefit" arising might not readily be recognised as such. The Government do not think that that sort of charge should be made in the very special circumstances envisaged in these clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that the relief is intended to apply only in exceptional circumstances. There must be a "special threat" to the "personal physical security" of the employee emanating from his "particular employment". One cannot simply obtain tax relief for normal security burglar alarms or for floodlighting one's house. It must be a specific threat that arises from one's employment. It is intended that the relief should go only to those who face a real threat to their person and that such threat is directly linked to their work. Such circumstances are most likely to occur where the nature of a person's employment means that he is a potential target for the activities of terrorists and other similar extremist groups. For relief to be given in relation to any personal security expenditure, it must have been incurred by the employer with the sole intention of improving the employee's security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relief will not cover expenditure for security measures against the sorts of general criminal threat which all citizens may face to one degree or another; nor where expenditure is incurred primarily in meeting a threat to property; nor where the perceived threat is unconnected with a person's employment. Any intention on an employer's part to reward his employee by meeting security expenditure will disqualify it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Each claim under the new provisions will, of course, depend on its own set of circumstances. Among the relevant factors in determining whether
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0127">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>215</span>
there is a "special threat" will be the geographical location of the business or employment, the nature of the underlying activities and where its customers are situated; and any particular, for example political, sensitivity which may attach to it. It is not difficult to envisage that there are those who work or have their businesses in Northern Ireland who are, as a result of their work activities, at special risk as potential terrorist targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is recognised that security facilities can take many forms, and the provisions recognise that, but at the same time exclude extravagant claims. Relief will be available in respect of assets and services that improve personal security. They could include, for example, alarm systems, bullet-resistant windows in houses, floodlighting, bodyguards and similar facilities. As well as the initial cost of assets, running costs will also qualify. The relief will apply whether facilities are made available at the home of the taxpayer or elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Committee will understand that this unusual provision has been introduced only after much consideration. It is narrowly defined and there are circumstances and cases that justify it. Where such protection has to be provided, whether in the public or private sector, it is extraordinary that there should be a benefit in kind charge.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be convenient if we discussed the principles behind the next seven clauses and then dealt with more specific matters. That would be satisfactory for the Opposition if other members of the Committee agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Financial Secretary for his explanation of the thinking behind the clauses. The Committee shares the Government's view that something must be done to ensure that people who are in the terrible position of being threatened with violence because of the nature of their jobs can be adequately protected without being disadvantaged under the tax system.
	<span class='label label-info column'>216</span>
We believe that there should be no difference in this respect between public service and private sector employment. I am probably one of the few Labour Members who still regrets that it is not possible to discuss security matters on the basis that we trust the Government's approach and accept that when the Government speak on security matters they speak for the whole country. In the wake of "Spycatcher", that just is not so. The Government speak for their own interest and not for any wider interest. It is perhaps just as well that we are discussing only the taxation arrangements that are involved in one aspect of these matters—the protection of potential victims in these seven clauses. It is important for the Committee to focus its attention on that point as we consider the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows that I have two broad areas of concern, and he has gone some way to dealing with them in his introductory remarks. The first concerns entitlement. It would be wholly unacceptable to the Opposition if the clauses were intended to open up a new area of tax avoidance whereby potential taxpayers argued that they needed special arrangements for their security and were able to deduct those from their tax obligations. Something like 40 per cent. of directors are chauffeur-driven. How easy it would be to convert those chauffeurs into bodyguards for tax purposes and to deduct their cost from money that would otherwise be due to the Inland Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary has made it clear that such scams will not be on. I welcome that assurance. We believe that the establishment of entitlement to claim should ultimately be a matter for the Revenue. The Revenue will obviously want to take specialist advice on that from the appropriate authorities—the security services, the police or others who might be involved. Ultimately there should be no argument about entitlement, but it must be a matter for the Revenue. If it is on any other basis it will clearly form a raft for tax evasion. Although the Minister has made it clear that the Government do not intend that to happen, I must press him to tell us how many persons the Government estimate are potential claimants and what he estimates the overall cost to the Revenue will be, not just on a start-up basis, because I can see that there might be some start-up costs as the provisions of the clause are bedded in, but on a continuing basis. Those figures should give us some idea of how the Government envisage the scope of the arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second reservation concerns the changes that can be made under these clauses. I do not wish to discuss the specific arrangements that are made for security because that would be counterproductive. However, I seek an assurance that the limited number of people who will be able to claim such an entitlement will also be restricted in the scope of their claims. For example, it would be outrageous to be able to claim for the relandscaping of a country house—if one was the sort of person who had a country house—on the grounds that one was frightened that assassins might lurk in the bushes and wished to plant flower beds instead. That does not seem reasonable. However, I suppose that a case could be made for certain circumstances and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0128">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>217</span>
specialist arrangements. It is difficult to go through specific examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should welcome an assurance from the Government that a decision about what is admissable is made by the Revenue on the basis of the best professional advice available. It should not be possible for claimants to insist on an entitlement and override the Revenue's ultimate judgment. It is difficult to go further than that in Committee, but I know that the Financial Secretary is aware of my concerns in both areas. I hope that he will respond to them satisfactorily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand the need to make adequate arrangements to protect citizens in this position. The example that comes most readily to mind is that of a building contractor who is still working for the security services or the police in Northern Ireland. I am giving away no secrets when I say that, because such issues are much discussed in the newspapers. If the director of a security services company withstood threats of violence because he was carrying out his lawful occupation, it is right for such arrangements to be put in hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The necessity for such arrangements arises directly from employment. While there may be a difference in quality when it comes to working mothers who need to have their children looked after, there is no difference in principle. If the Government believe that this provision is right, will the Financial Secretary explain why they are still holding out against pressure for similar tax reliefs on workplace nurseries? No doubt he will say that there is all the qualitative difference in the world between being threatened with violence—perhaps death—and having one's offspring looked after when one is working. I understand that there is a qualitative difference—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is so much difference that the hon. Gentleman is in danger of running out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly would not dream of incurring your displeasure by going too wide of the clause, Mr. Cormack. However, I should be grateful if the Financial Secretary will refer to the principle clearly contained in these provisions and say how far he feels that that principle should or could be extended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the clause. Regrettably, it is necessary, given the dangers to which some people are exposed as a result of their employment or, as later causes show, self-employed work. This provision is a potential candidate for abuse, but experience leads me to believe that the Revenue will work hard to ensure that it is not abused. Anyone wishing to challenge the Revenue's view on that will have to go through all the ramifications involving commissioners, and so on. So the danger of abuse is pretty well guarded against. We must have regard to the difficulties faced by those whose work, whether or not they are publicly employed, can put them in danger of their lives.

Perhaps we should call this the Oliver North section of the Bill. It might have helped him in
	<span class='label label-info column'>218</span>
mounting his defence to argue that in Britain provision of security in the home of someone exposed to threat is recognised as something that should not be subject to taxation. However, to pursue that would be to stray from the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to pursue the question that I put to the Financial Secretary earlier. The concerns behind the clause, with which every member of the Committee sympathises, seem to have to do with terrorist-related threats to personal security. Why cannot it be written into the Bill that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"special threat to … personal physical security"</p></blockquote>
means a terrorist-related threat? If that cannot be written into the Bill, will the Financial Secretary say why not? Is he considering other kinds of non terrorist-related threat, or is the clause so worded because of a convention or technicality?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: By and large, I share the general acceptance of the clause, particularly the provision of physical assets as a means of protection. Those can easily be quantified and assessed. However, the Minister also mentioned the employment of bodyguards as a legitimate expense in certain circumstances. I have some difficulties with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is generally accepted in this country—at least by the police force in Fife—that personal protection is the job of the police, not of private bodyguards. Moreover, in some cases the value of a private bodyguard must be questioned, as only rarely are they allowed to be armed. I can refer to the following case, as it is no longer sub judice. It concerns a man in my constituency who was the head of a Croatian nationalist organisation. He was gunned down one morning in a quiet street—an unlikely occurrence in Kirkcaldy. The man had applied to have a bodyguard because he was conscious of the fact that his life was at risk, and had been refused. I give that example purely as an illustration of what may arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The growing prevalence in some European countries, including Ireland, of kidnapping can also be considered as a threat. It is difficult to quantify such threats. Although the Inland Revenue may try to satisfy itself about the genuineness of the perceived threat, it clearly cannot do so on its own. I do not expect it to be written into the Bill, but it is clear that the police force or some form of national security organisation must be involved, at least to give advice in some of those cases. Will the Minister give some further assurances on that aspect of the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tatton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervene rather unexpectedly to ask my right hon. Friend the Minister to clarify one or two points that occurred to me as I listened to the speeches that have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is my right hon. Friend seeking to distinguish between terrorist threats that arise out of an intention to undermine the integrity of the state? I can see that there may be a good justification for introducing such a relief. If not, is he seeking to mark a distinction between those and other threats of violence, which may not have a political content?

	<span class='label label-info column'>219</span>
Clause 48(4) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"a special threat to … personal physical security, and"—</p></blockquote>
a threat which
	<br><blockquote><p>"arises … by virtue of the particular employment concerned".</p></blockquote>
Does my right hon. Friend envisage categories of employment, which would be automatically covered for the purposes of the clause, or will the nexus in each case be a perceived threat to a particular individual? Will he have to prove that threats had been issued against him or others in similar circumstances? Will it be possible to make an assumption about how such a person might be treated for the purposes of this legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my opening remarks will have satisfied the points made by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown). I repeat that the measure is intended to be tightly drawn. There is no danger of tax avoidance in those circumstances. We have been driven to amending the law in recognition of the position that was developing and the need to treat public and private sectors equally. We have to administer the law as it stands. It looked as though the benefit in kind legislation might apply when people's lives were under a genuine threat by merit of the jobs they did. It is not easy for me to give examples—it requires little imagination to appreciate what those are in Northern Ireland—but were I to spell them out, the Committee would be in no doubt whatsoever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the difficulty of the point made by the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie). Advice would be taken by the Inland Revenue in making an assessment of the threat to someone. That threat must arise by merit of one's job. It is not enough for individuals to feel that they are under threat—the threat has to arise by merit of the job. That is one reply to the point made by my hon. Friend the member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) when he talked about terrorism against the state. This is not purely a public sector phenomenon. The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East gave examples of where it may be ultimately directed against the state, but is directed against individuals and people working in the private sector. The issue under discussion applies to public servants and to businessmen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the second point of my hon. Friend the member for Tatton, the person would not have to prove the threat. The Revenue would obviously have to be satisfied. As the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East wanted to know, the Revenue will decide, but it will take advice where it needs to. The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy asked about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East asked me to give figures. I cannot give figures because they are de minimis. We expect the measure to have a negligible cost and to apply to an extremely small number of people. The hon. Gentleman referred to workplace nurseries—he shrugs generously and says that there is no need to reply to that. However, he answered the point himself. It is difficult to equate a benefit in kind, which we put into the strict tax laws as a taxable benefit, with a special threat arising from
	<span class='label label-info column'>220</span>
work. Far from being a benefit, security measures can have a very negative and detrimental effect on people's lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) felt that the reference was too unspecific, and he would have preferred the clause to contain a definition of terrorism. But it would not be easy to draft such a definition. The drafting that we have chosen is fairly specific. The special threat referred to in the new provisions must arise directly from the particular employment, and it must be a threat to the physical security of the employee. All that, together, will allow the relief to be given only where it is intended, and there is no reason in principle for the relief to extend beyond special terrorist, extremist and similar threats into the general sphere of criminal threats against property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the clause apply, as one could reasonably argue that it should, to a trade that was the subject of much violent crime—for instance, gang warfare, as in the case of the ice-cream trade in Glasgow—and a company decided that a number of its employees faced a direct and real threat against their persons which could be manifest in their homes? I assume that the wording and spirit of the clause would cover some such cases. Or is the Minister seeking to confine the provision either to the terrorist threat or to a threat that arises from the public nature of the work that is being done?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Terrorism is the most likely, but there might be other instances in which it arose out from the nature of the employment itself. However, I expect that such instances would be extremely restricted and rare.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McDonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that the Financial Secretary would reply, because his use of the phrase "terrorist and other similar threats" leaves us rather puzzled. I cannot imagine any other threat that would justify this very special form of tax relief. We all feel great sympathy with people who face terrorist-related threats, and I should have thought that subsection (4)(a) could have been worded "special terrorist-related threat" or even drop the word "special" and make it specifically "terrorist-related threat" without making it too difficult to understand. But we worry when the Financial Secretary talks about it going beyond simple terrorist-related threats to personal security, because it is not clear that the same understanding would extend to non-terrorist related threats to personal security. All sorts of occupation involve hazards to life and limb, but they do not enjoy special tax relief status for that reason. The sympathy that the Financial Secretary evokes among Opposition Members relies very much on the fact that his purpose is to deal specifically with terrorist-related threats. If the right hon. Gentleman wants to go further, he should endeavour to justify that; if he does not want to go further, I see no problem. To replace "special threat" with "terrorist-related threat" would be much clearer and simpler and more in keeping with what I understand his intention to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said in reply to the hon. Member for Newcastle uon Tyne, East terrorism is not the only case in which a threat to a person might arise by merit of what he does and what his employment is, but that it is obviously one of the main ones. I see no difficulty in the wording referring to employment and threats arising out of the employment. That is not a difficult concept; it restricts the provision. It has been made clear that the provision does not extend to protection against the run-of-the-mill criminal activities that the average citizen has to face. I have givern an assurance that the provision will be tightly restricted and that it is the Government's intention that it should apply to only a small number of people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of this clause, and of clause 112, is to allow expenditure other than capital expenditure incurred by an individual or partnership of individuals—this answers the question asked by the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy—on certain assets and services provided for security purposes to qualify for tax relief as a deduction in calculating profits. Capital expenditure on security assets of this nature is to qualify for specific relief under clauses 118 and 119. All four clauses are designed to give self-employed people broadly the same tax reliefs as those which are being provided for employees under clauses 47 to 49.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To qualify for relief, the expenditure must have been incurred with the sole object of meeting a threat to an individual's personal physical security, arising wholly or mainly by virtue of the particular business activity being carried on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The threat must be a special threat—that is to say, it has to be a threat of a kind which is somehow greater and more serious than would be faced by the generality of individuals in a similar line of business. The relief is aimed at those to whom there is a special threat through their work from the activities of terrorists, extremists and of other groups of people who might resort to violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Essentially the relief is aimed at expenditure incurred by a business man on security protection at his own home. Expenditure on the protection of his business premises will generally qualify for relief anyway. We do not need to make special provision. Expenditure on protection at a business man's own home would not, generally, qualify for relief as the law stands because there is a private purpose behind
	<span class='label label-info column'>222</span>
such expenditure. The new rule will ensure that relief is due notwithstanding the fact that there is an element of private benefit, and notwithstanding the fact that the expenditure may also benefit the individual's own family or household. The sort of expenditure covered will include rent paid for alarm systems, special lighting and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
