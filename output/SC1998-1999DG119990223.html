	<div class='legislation'>Draft National Assembly for Wales (Disqualification) Order 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Alun Michael)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft National Assembly for Wales (Disqualification) Order 1999.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may also consider the draft National Assembly for Wales (Representation of the People) Order 1999.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak to both orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My starting point for the National Assembly for Wales (Disqualification) Order is the aim to keep disqualification to a minimum. The original proposals would have been unfair to public employees, preventing national health service staff and others from standing for the Assembly and disfranchising 22 per cent, of the work force in Wales. I disagree fundamentally with that approach, and the draft order narrows down the field to the necessary minimum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 12 of the Government of Wales Act 1998 identifies directly a number of persons and classes of person who may not also be members of the Assembly. In addition, it provides for an Order in Council to designate further offices and employments, the holders of which would also be disqualified from becoming members of the Assembly. The draft of such an order is now before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are no direct parallels to the National Assembly in the United Kingdom. One option would have been to replicate the extensive listing under the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975. That would not have been an appropriate course of action. The Assembly will have very different powers and responsibilities from the House of Commons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Rogers 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rhondda)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I congratulate my right hon. Friend on his great victory on Saturday? I am not sure to what he refers in the document before us. I wonder whether he could help me, as I am a little lost by his reference to section 12.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two documents before us. I shall refer to the larger document second. The first lists the bodies whose members, and in some cases employees, would be disqualified from membership of the Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have explained that the bodies listed are appropriate because the Assembly will have very different powers and responsibilities from the House of Commons. The justification for disqualifying people from election must be based on consideration
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
of whether their responsibilities as elected representatives are incompatible with their other responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A consultation paper was issued in August 1998, with comments sought by 2 October. Its starting point was to identify executive bodies that would have a line of accountability to the Assembly, direct or otherwise. There are a variety of such bodies and I would be happy to go into detail, but I think that it is clear from the order what is intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second key consideration is to preserve the impartiality of bodies that have a quasi-judicial function. We intend that the Assembly will be an inclusive institution, where the conduct of its business will be carried out in a far more transparent manner. That has important implications for the broadcasting interests and the coverage that they can be expected to provide across the whole range of the Assembly's functions. For that reason, the consultation paper proposed that broadcasting should be brought within the scope of the order's disqualification provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have set out clearly the basic principles on which the list has been constructed. Some 50 responses were received and they have been carefully considered. It was proposed that there should be universal disqualification for the staff of the bodies suggested as coming within the scope of the order. However, that proposal attracted considerable criticism and I agreed strongly that it would have been far too draconian. The staff of an organisation should not necessarily be placed under the same limitations as board members. The order therefore applies only to a limited restriction to certain classes of employee, mainly civil servants, preventing them from becoming Members of the Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Citizens should be debarred from political activity only when there is good reason. We should be aware that we are placing a limit on their democratic rights, and should restrict exclusions to the necessary minimum. That is the principle that I have sought to apply, and I believe that several members of the Committee will find that to be in accord with the views that they expressed in response to the original document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some have suggested that the National Assembly will be a glorified county council in that it will have administrative functions but no legislative or financial powers. Under the rather vicious local government legislation brought in by Lady Thatcher in the mid-1980s, members of staff of other bodies in Wales that spend huge sums of money, such as county councils, are not allowed to stand for election. Why will there be a difference between the staff of bodies that will be funded by the National Assembly and the people who work for local government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend is referring to the position of people who stand at local government elections vis-a-vis the levels of responsibility above which political activity is debarred. That issue is different from the one with which we are dealing. We are considering whether members of boards, and also members of staff of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0064">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
particular organisations, should be debarred from becoming Members of the Assembly. We are not discussing the staff of the Assembly; as civil servants, they will be covered directly. We are talking about the saff of the vast range of bodies, such as NHS trusts and health authorities, that will have a relationship with, and receive finances from, the Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is where we draw the line. Should some people be barrred from becoming Members of the Assembly because that would not be consistent with their role? When will we require someone to resign a role that is inconsistent with becoming a Member of the Assembly? Those issues arise normally—when people become Members of Parliament, for instance. As I said, I have applied the principle of using disqualifications when they are necessary because of a clear danger of conflict of interest. In accordance with that principle, I have narrowed down the range of individuals who will be covered by the disqualification order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand the point made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales, but I am afraid that he does not understand mine. The chief executives of the Sports Council for Wales and the Arts Council for Wales, for example, are not members of the board but paid members of staff, and so might have direct and vested interests in any "ferret-in-the-sack" political arguments between bodies over the allocation of moneys. It is difficult to understand why an executive employee will not be disqualified when someone in a similar position in local government certainly would be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend misunderstands the relationship between the Assembly and the bodies that will receive finance from it, which is akin to the current relationship between Parliament and those bodies. In fact, that is exactly the relationship, because bodies that will be funded by the Assembly are currently funded by the Welsh Office. Therefore, parliamentary election ought to form the basis for comparison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is relatively straightforward in its impact, as a result of extensive consultation since the original draft's publication last August.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part I lists those 28 bodies in which all members are disqualified from membership of the Assembly. Part II identifies a further 43 bodies and offices, the members or post-holders of which cannot be members of the Assembly. In part II, a distinction has been made for employees who by virtue of their employment are ex-officio members of the board. I do not consider that it would be appropriate to apply disqualification in those circumstances. That relates to one of the examples that my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Mr. Rogers) mentioned. The more obvious examples relate to senior managers in NHS bodies in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the Welsh public sector bodies listed in part I and part II will have a direct link with Assembly and the funding dependency will be clear. Others operate in a quasi-judicial manner. On the grounds of preserving impartiality, members of the Audit Commission and the Commission for Local Administration in Wales will be disqualified, as will the health service
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
commissioner for Wales and the commissioner or assistant commissioner of the boundary commission for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a range of social security bodies to which disqualification will apply. Although their remits fall outside the functions to be exercised by the Assembly, those bodies have a duty to decide appeals in Wales on matters that could directly or indirectly affect the Assembly's activities or expenditure or affect Assembly Members directly. For example, the bodies could deal with child support maintenance appeals or decisions that influence the respective responsibilities of local authority social services departments and the Department of Social Security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The social security commissioner and the child support commissioner, who are analogous to High Court judges, are disqualified by the provisions of section 12 of the Government of Wales Act, which applies the House of Commons Disqualification Act. It is consistent to ensure that disqualification from Assembly membership is extended to the social security appeal and tribunal structure that is responsible for precedent-setting decisions, and has a deciding influence over the way in which a particular tribunal carries out its business. Similar considerations apply to other bodies listed in the order. There is a clear risk of actual or potential conflicts of interest and compromising impartiality if members of pension bodies are able to sit in the Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As was stated in the consultation document, I have decided that disqualification should apply also to board members of the training and enterprise councils in Wales and the career service companies in Wales, and to the board of the Welsh European programme executive. That will be given effect through the contractual relationship that exists between the Welsh Office and the training and enterprise councils and career companies. For the Welsh European programme executive, I will enter into an agreement with the company to preclude Assembly members from serving on its board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rules that will apply to the conduct of the elections to the Assembly will require all candidates, at the stage when consent is given to the formal nomination of their candidature, to confirm that they are not disqualified from becoming a member of the Assembly. That follows the same rules that apply to elections to the House of Commons. The elections to the Assembly will take place on 6 May, and the final date for the submission of nomination papers will be 8 April. Where people currently hold disqualifying posts or employment, the order will require them to resign before they give consent to their candidature as part of the formal nomination procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where a member of a public body has resigned that membership to stand for election to the Assembly and is unsuccessful, there is a discretion to reinstate that member to the body concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If someone unsuccessfully stands for election, will it automatically be deemed appropriate in most cases for them to go back to their former positions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0065">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will not be automatic. There is discretion to allow them to do so. Again, I think that one should not discourage people from taking part in political life by penalising them. Speaking off the top of my head, I imagine that there might be circumstances in which reinstatement would not be appropriate. If there had been a closely debated controversy relating to the work of a body, reinstatement might not be appropriate; both sides might agree about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it is right to follow common sense. People need to be insulated against the danger of misusing their position during an election period, but if there is no such problem in the way, they should not be penalised for taking part in democratic processes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification of concrete examples from the past. If somebody worked for the BBC as a reporter, resigned to fight a general election and lost that election, would the Secretary of State deem there to be an onus on the BBC to re-employ that person as a reporter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A distinction must be made between that situation, in which the BBC would have to take a decision on appropriate action—especially if someone moved from political reporting for the election campaign and then moved back—and a situation in which someone was on the board of a body, where there is a funding relationship with the Assembly. If a board member of, for example, the Welsh Language Board resigned to stand for the Assembly but was not elected, it would be appropriate, once the political activity was over, for that person to be reinstated on the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. John Marek 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend should think about that matter carefully. What is the point of having disqualifications if people who are defeated can be reinstated? It is up to the body to decide whether to reinstate such a person. As we are on the subject, will the Secretary of State explain why he has disqualified members of the Council of the National Museum of Wales and the Council of the National Library of Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend misses the point. If we were to take the approach that he suggests, people would be penalised for being involved in political activity, which is wrong. It is an outrageous suggestion, and I stongly disagree with him. The Council of the National Museum of Wales receives the vast bulk of its finances from the public purse. It would therefore be inconsistent to be a member of that body and a Member of the Assembly, according to the three basic principles that we used to compile the list. I gave long and careful thought to the list not only to avoid any inapproprate conflicts of interest but to avoid disbarring people where that is unnecessary. Many other people from a variety of political parties and public bodies contributed their observations in response to the consultation, and we should be proud that the list is the result of such caerful thought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what is outrageous about my suggestion. First, would it not be more open to require that someone who, for example, is a member of the BBC should resign that post for the period of the election? At least that person could be certain of returning to his or her former position; I would have no objection to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, if members of the Council of the National Library of Wales and the Council of the National Museum of Wales are disqualified, why has the Secetary of State not disqualified council members of the various university colleges, which also get all their money from the Welsh Office?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend again misses the point. It is the sensitivity of a BBC reporter's role that is at issue, and that must be dealt with by the employer and not by the disqualification order. As for his second point, the funding relationship between bodies such as the Council of the National Museum of Wales and the Welsh Office is direct and immediate. Universities, however, are funded—at least partly—by the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales rather than by the Welsh Office directly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Page 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South-West Hertfordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State's argument is common sense, and I agree with most of it. Will he clarify one issue regarding the National Audit Office? As a member of the Public Accounts Committee I am concerned that the activities of the National Audit Office will be duplicated, and thereby weakened, by the Welsh Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the National Audit Act 1983 the Exchequer and Audit Department became the National Audit Office and its staff were no longer civil servants. The Secretary of State's list makes it clear that the Comptroller and Auditor General, quite rightly, has been excluded from various offices. However, the staff of the National Audit Office, who will eventually number several hundred, have access to all other Government Departments. Should not they also be excluded?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should make it clear that the work of the National Audit Office is important. We have taken steps to ensure that, as far as the Assembly is concerned, the National Audit Office is as effective and stringent as the Welsh Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Comptroller and Auditor General and his or her staff are disqualified from holding various offices, as is the Auditor General for Wales. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman. The matter is outside the scope of the order, but I am keen to ensure that the effectiveness of the National Audit Office in Wales is not weakened in any way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my right hon. Friend proceeds, I should express my concern about the disqualification of members of staff of the Forestry Commission. I apologise for failing to notice that part II of the National Assembly for Wales (Disqualification) Order 1999 refers to the disqualification of the certification officer and assistant certification officers of the various boards, which answers the point that I made earlier.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0066">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
However, the order does not make clear the level at which certain people will be disqualified. It refers broadly to a
	<br><blockquote><p>"Member of the staff of the Forestry Commissioners."</p></blockquote>
Does that preclude a forester, or anyone who works in a national forest?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That disqualification is included for the purposes of certainty. Funding for the Forestry Commission's activities in Wales will be the responsibility of the Assembly. Staff of the Forestry Commission are deemed to be civil servants and have been specified in the order for the avoidance of doubt. I appreciate that there appears to be an anomaly, but in treating Forestry Commission staff the same as civil servants from other Government Departments the order avoids an anomaly and is consistent with our intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Secretary of State estimated how many people in Wales who are members of these bodies will be ineligible to stand for election to the National Assembly for Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not made a precise calculation, but our best estimate is about 5,000. That is considerably fewer than the figure given in the draft order that was published last August, which estimated that about 22 per cent, of the work force would be affected. We have drawn the line tightly and appropriately—the order will exclude those whom it is appropriate to exclude from membership of the Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For many such individuals, the matter is largely one of choice. In order to qualify for membership of the Assembly, they can resign from the disqualifying appointment. Those who wish to be Members of Parliament are in a similar situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One can understand the reasons for disqualification. Some people have been heavily involved in the politics of the Assembly—for example, those who run public relations bodies and lobbying firms. If they have contracts with the Welsh Office, will they be excluded from standing? They probably have a more direct financial interest than many who have been excluded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I understand my hon. Friend's point, but the matter will not be dealt with by the disqualification order. It will be covered by the Assembly's own regulations on the declaration of interests and inappropriate activities for its members. Therefore, we approach the issue from both ends: identifying what disqualifies a person from becoming an Assembly Member and—in order to catch the individuals to who my hon. Friend is referring—what activities are not appropriate for Assembly Members. We thereby limit, through the Assembly's own regulations, candidates' participation in the lobbying activities, to which my hon. Friend refers. I appreciate that the matter is not addressed in the order, but that is because it will be dealt with through the mechanism that I have just described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
The disqualification provisions applying to the Assembly must be relevant to its circumstances. That is the basic principle that we have sought to apply and that is what the draft Order in Council achieves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Raymond Powell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ogmore)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certain categories of member, or at least categories of office would be disqualified. The representation of the people legislation that applied to parliamentarians used to include a provision that people who were mentally ill could not be Members of Parliament and could not vote in elections. To my knowledge, one prospective candidate is in a category that is not on the list, but he had a moment of madness that exalted my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to his present position. My concern is not only about him, but about the category of members of the other place. Why are members of the House of Lords not on the list of exclusions? Is it because one member of the other place is reported to have been selected, but not yet elected, to the position of Presiding Officer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is asked and will be asked by people in Wales: why are we excluding certain categories of members from standing for the Assembly while allowing others to stand? It would be a good idea if the Privy Council and the Committee looked again—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind members of the Committee that the debate can continue for only an hour and a half. I insist that interventions must be as brief as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Raymond Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was just coming to the point, Mr. Benton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The list covers a number of exclusions. There are 72 categories on the list, but my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State should have considered a number of others before the list was concluded and agreed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with mental illness, which is covered by section 12(2) of the Government of Wales Act 1998, so there is no need to include it in the list in the order. Secondly, peers may stand under section 13. The basic principle is that peers are regarded as Members of Parliament, so it would be inconsistent for them to become Members of Parliament through membership of the House of Lords and eligibe to become members of this House through election. That does not arise in relation to the Assembly, which is quite a separate body. Again, the question will be whether there are grounds for excluding individuals from elections. By and large, it is up to the electorate whether to elect people with different backgrounds to be Members of the Assembly. Exclusions should relate to cases of a discrete conflict of interest that needs to be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having dealt with that at greater length than I anticipated would be necessary, although I hope that I have satisfied hon. Members, I turn to the order that deals with elections—the National Assembly for Wales (Representation of the People) Order. I want to make it clear that the version of the order that we are considering today is that which was laid on 22 February, not the version laid on 15 February, which has been withdrawn. In the original version, a clerical
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0067">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
error deleted almost half schedule 5(53), making it defective. We have corrected the error and amended the drafting slightly to clarify the rules under which an Assembly regional ballot paper may be accepted. I shall explain that change later, and I apologise to hon. Members for any inconvenience that replacement may have caused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first elections to the Assembly will be on 6 May 1999. Section 11(1) of the Government of Wales Act 1998 allows the Secretary of State by order to make provision for the conduct of Assembly elections, including setting limits to election expenses of candidates and registered political parties and procedures for election petitions. The draft order draws heavily on provisions from the Representation of the People Acts 1983 and 1985 and includes material from statutory instruments made under those Acts and other legislation on the same basis. We have tried to make the rules consistent. We have also had to take account of two other developments which affect elections in the UK—the Registration of Political Parties Act 1998 and the recommendations of the Neill committee on the funding of political parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order has been the subject of detailed discussion and consultation from the very start. To provide expert input, in December 1997, my predecessor set up an elections working group to advise my officials on the contents of the order. The working group comprised senior returning officers and elections administrators. The group members have reported regularly to their colleagues in Wales and fed back their views. We also issued a draft of the order to political parties, returning officers and a host of other organisations, such as the Wales TUC, and the CBI Wales. A copy was placed on the Welsh Office website. Therefore, there has been considerable consultation on the detail of the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the order does no more than apply provisions that are equivalent to those in the rules for parliamentary or, occasionally, local government elections, with modifications because of the two-vote system. I shall explain where and why there are significant departures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Articles 1 to 13 deal mainly with voting, registration, polling places and absent voting. Polling places for Assembly elections will be the same as those for parliamentary elections and the absent vote criteria are the same as those for local government elections, as the electorate is the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Raymond Powell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ogmore)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bridgend county borough council is considering closing several polling stations throughout the borough, which covers two parliamentary seats and includes at least 44 polling stations. In some places, the number of polling stations will reduce from six to two. Given that we have councillors standing in 47 wards, in addition to the elections to the Welsh Assembly, one would imagine that the Government would want to increase the number of polling stations to ensure that everyone could exercise his or her right to vote. Some polling stations that people have used for voting in
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
parliamentary elections will be closed. I am also given to understand that there have been difficulties in using schools as polling stations because of the disruption to education. Will my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State look into that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once the order is made, it will be for the returning officers to make arrangements in accordance with it. I refer my hon. Friend to article 6, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to paragraph (3), the polling districts and polling places to have effect at Assembly elections … shall be the districts and places as have effect at parliamentary elections."</p></blockquote>
The relevant provisions are very precise. Obviously, I cannot comment on an individual authority's decisions, but I shall ask my officials to check with the relevant local authority to ensure that it is aware of the order's provisions—assuming that the House agrees to them. The decisions that the authority will have to take are described in the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Secretary of State knows, returning officers already get a tidy sum in addition to their normal salary. Will regional returning officers get even greater sums for performing their duty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The arrangements for remuneration are agreed, and I do not think that additional sums are involved. The arrangements will be in accordance with the normal provisions. I shall check on the position, and if there is anything further to add, I shall inform my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 14 provides for the combination of polls when Assembly elections take place on the same day as local government elections, which will happen on 6 May 1999.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Articles 15 to 22 deal with the administration of elections. I should be happy to discuss those articles at length, but it may be more sensible to highlight certain points and to respond to any matters that Committee members raise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are there any provisions about the description of candidates on ballot papers? If there are, I cannot find them. For example, candidates might stand as new Labour, as old Labour or simply as Labour. I understand that Labour party candidates will describe themselves as "the Labour party candidate". Could someone stand simply under the description "Labour" if he wanted to? I have looked in the order for the relevant provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is dealt with in the schedules, which we shall reach presently. Legislation dealing with the registration of political parties and the way in which candidates can be described on ballot forms was introduced during the previous Session, and it deals with the issue that my hon. Friend has raised. The appendices illustrate what the ballot papers will look like. That matter was the subject of considerable consultation with returning officers, political parties and focus groups. The aim was to ensure that the way in which ballot forms were understood by members of the public was consistent with the understanding of political parties and the cognoscenti.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a big word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was just trying to be a bit posh, see?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Articles 23 to 31 equate to rules in the Representation of the People Act 1983 for parliamentary and local government elections. Articles 32 to 36 define the arrangements for the appointment of election agents and sub-agents. They are based on standard provisions of the 1983 Act. There will be only one election agent for each party list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Articles 37 to 65 deal with election expenses. Their provisions draw on the provisions of the 1983 Act that apply to candidates at parliamentary elections and on the recommendations that were submitted in the autumn of 1998 by the Neill committee on standards in public life in its report on the funding of political parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have identified expenses limits at the constituency level and above. The proposed limits are in articles 46 to 48. We have followed without exception the Neill committee recommendations. For constituency elections, the same limits apply as to elections to the House, except that the figures have been uprated in line with inflation. Independent candidates at regional elections will have limits equivalent to the sum of the limits in all the constituencies in the electoral region. There will be no regional limit for registered political parties, but there will be a national limit of £600,000 for such parties at a general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Expenses incurred in the election campaign of a constituency candidate of a registered political party will not count towards the national total. In effect, expenses on a constituency campaign will be ring-fenced. The national expenses total for a party will be made up of all expenses incurred by that party that are not specific to an individual constituency campaign. The national total will include expenses on the regional campaigns and any expenditure of a general nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 66 makes provision for free mail shots. We have provided for one free mail shot per constituency, one for each independent candidate and one for each party list at a regional election. Suggestions were made, and Plaid Cymru specifically asked for parties standing at constituency and regional elections to be able to send a single leaflet to electors presenting both their list candidates and their constituency candidates in that region. That is provided for in the order, and the Royal Mail is amending its regulations accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 67 deals with broadcasting. Articles 68 to 158 deal with election meetings, disturbances, bribery, treating, election petitions and a range of miscellaneous provisions relating to forms and notices, and the relaxation of planning rules for Assembly election advertisements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the schedules, which in general are straightforward. I am happy to respond to any points of detail, but I shall concentrate on schedule 5, which lays down the main body of rules for the conduct of an Assembly election. The provisions are based largely on the parliamentary election rules of 1983.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Paragraphs 1 to 22 of schedule 5 set out the election timetable and deal with nominations deposits, withdrawals, disqualifications and so on. The provisions take account of the different types of candidature at Assembly elections. There will be constituency candidates, independent or individual candidates at regional elections, and regional lists submitted by registered political parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nomination procedure also takes account of the provisions of the Registration of Political Parties Act 1998, to which I referred in my response to my hon. Friend a few moments ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies (Lianelli)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been looking at the form of the two ballot papers, and the ballot paper for voting for individuals has nothing on it about independent people, whereas the ballot paper for voting for parties includes the name of an independent person. Is that a printing error? Should they not be the other way round?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. That has been the subject of considerable consultation. However, I understand my right hon. Friend's point. The information that must be provided in relation to an independent party on the regional list—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I believe that my right hon. Friend was referring to the regional list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am referring not to independent parties, but to individuals who describe themselves as independent. Should they not be on the first list, where the vote is for a person, rather than on the other list, where the vote is for a party?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point that my right hon. Friend is making, and I refer him—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Look on the other side of the paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer my right hon. Friend to our debate on the original legislation. That left open the option of individuals standing either in an individual constituency—my right hon. Friend's point appears quite sensible—or, as the Act also provides, as independent candidates at regional level. It is not open to us to change that through the order. Therefore we must make allowance in the order and on the ballot forms for an independent candidate to stand at regional level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that my right hon. Friend may be surprised, as I was when I realised the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.15 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are we talking about individuals standing at constituency level?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. In the appendix my right hon. Friend will find an example of somebody standing as an independent—the second candidate on the sample ballot paper. What strikes him as slightly odd is that an independent should be on the regional list. The legislation allowed for that, so we must make provision in the ballot paper. It strikes me as less likely that such a person would stand at the regional level, but if the legislation allows for that, we must make provision for it in the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0069">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us suppose that under the new regulations on registration of political parties—I am not sure how a political party becomes registered—20 disgrunted people want to call themselves Labour, without any other description. Must they describe themselves as "independent"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can answer that simply. The situation is covered by the Registration of Political Parties Act 1998. It will not be open to people unofficially to use the name of a political party that has been registered, as is required under that Act. Therefore, some of the dangers and problems that have arisen for all political parties in different ways will be prevented. The matter is not dealt with in the order, because it was dealt with in the primary legislation passed last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Carmarthen and Dinefwr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask about the description of candidates on the ballor paper. My hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda said that somebody could describe himself as "old Labour", "new Labour" or whatever it may be. My question is a different one. Plaid Cymru now calls itself the party of Wales. That is a misnomer, but that is what it calls itself. If a Labour candidate chose to use the label "Labour, the party of Wales", which would be an accurate description, would that be allowed on the ballot paper?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is also dealt with by the Registration of Political Parties Act 1998. I agree with my hon. Friend that it is a cheek for Plaid Cymru to describe itself as the party of Wales. It would be appropriate for the Labour party to describe itself as "the real party of Wales". However, such matters are academic, because they are dealt with in the Registration of Political Parties Act 1998, which takes them out of dispute for the future. We can enjoy a little bit of knockabout at the expense of Plaid Cymru, but we cannot vary the primary legislation by means of the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly not enter into any knockabout with Plaid Cymru, but the intention of that Act was to stop abuses, with people standing as "Conservatories" instead of Conservatives, or "Literal Democrats" instead of Liberal Democrats. It may be worth thinking again about the Act in future, because it will be used to stop people standing as independent Labour or independent Conservative; they will have to stand simply as independents, and that may not be the sort of message that they want to send out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The primary legislation is not before us today. I think that there was cross-party agreement that to allow people to associate themselves with a political party when they were not members of it, and not its official candidates, misled the public. The point of the order is to allow members of the public to vote according to their political preferences. Therefore it is sensible for this secondary legislation to enable that to be done in the most orderly and best informed way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is grateful for the substantial help that he receives from Opposition Members, but I am
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
sure that he would tell the Opposition spokesman, the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr Evans) that somebody who stood as a greenhouse in the Rhondda would probably get more votes than if he stood as a Conservative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether such a person would genuinely want to stand for the greenhouse party, but I believe that the person who stood for the "Conservatory" party genuinely wanted to give everybody a conservatory. It is not open to anyone to do so unless the requirements of the Registration of Political Parties Act 1998 are met. Hereafter I shall hide behind the primary legislation, which is not under consideration today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the debate has moved on, I should say that deposits will be £500 for a constituency candidate, an independent candidate in a regional election and for inclusion on a regional list. Paragraphs 23 and 24 and associated parts of the appendix contain the rules for the lay-out of ballot papers. Paragraphs 26 to 36 cover the official appointment of election staff and poll cards. They are based on the standard procedure, which has been adapted where necessary for the two-vote system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Daries</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The regional ballot paper says, "Vote once only", and it contains boxes to mark one's vote. The Conservative party, for example, has a list of candidates that includes Janice Williams and Ross Davies. If a person votes Conservative, will his Member be one of the listed candidates? If so, which one? Who is the candidate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been considerable debate about whether a list of candidates should appear, and a general welcome was given to its inclusion. Focus groups, political parties and electoral registration officers felt that including the list would deal with many queries that would have arisen had the list not appeared on the form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will that be explained to the voters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will, of course, be an explanation for voters. The regional ballot form offers a simple and clear explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the relevant bodies consider explaining on the ballot paper the fact that the first candidate on the list will be elected?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What should and should not be on the ballot paper has been considered carefully. We intend to do much to inform people in advance of the election about how the system will operate. There was a strong view that the information on the ballot paper should be kept to the minimum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cynog Dafis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be better to provide the information that we have been discussing in the polling booth rather than on the ballot paper, which would clutter it up and make the process much more complicated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The explanatory details that will be sent to every elector in advance will make the position clear. It was suggested at one stage, for instance, that the list of candidates should appear on the wall of the electoral booth rather than on the ballot paper, but it was generally felt that that would be too complicated: the information that is necessary for taking a decision should be on the ballot paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) asked whether the first person on the list would be elected. The danger with that approach is that it may not be correct. For instance, the first person on the regional list might also be on a constituency list. If that candidate won the constituency election, he or she could not be elected from the regional list. That is why it is important not to overload the information that appears on the ballot paper or anywhere else. The position will be explained in the information that is sent to each elector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This will be my last question. Will a party be allowed to change the order of the candidates on the list? If I vote for the Conservative party and the proportional system works, am I certain to get Janice Williams as my Member, or might I get Sarah Bafer, who appears at number 12?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That matter is dealt with elsewhere in regulations, but my understanding is that the person at the top of the list will be elected, unless they have been elected to a constituency seat, and so on down the list. The exception would be that if, for example, No. 1 were elected in his or her constituency, No. 2 would become an Assembly Member. If that person died a year later, there would be an opportunity for the party to say whether No. 3 should be put forward—as he or she might have resigned from the party, or whatever, but that eventuality is dealt with in the regulation. In respect of clarity at the time of the election, I believe that the process is clear and people can be as confident as my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli wishes to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend is correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that I have dealt with paragraphs 26 to 36. Paragraphs 37 to 48 apply the standard parliamentary rules for procedures in polling stations, adapted as necessary for the two-vote system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraphs 49 to 64 deal with the count, declarations and procedures after the count. Counting will take place on the Friday. These paragraphs provide for the constituency returning officer to count the ballot papers for his constituency election and those cast for the regional election in his constituency. On completion of the regional count, the constituency returning officer will relay the totals to the regional returning officer. Once he or she has agreed the totals, the constituency returning officer may give a local announcement of those figures. The constituency returning officer may declare the constituency result, but will have to relay that result also to the regional
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
returning officer to enable the latter to calculate the allocation of the regional seats. The regional returning officer will declare the regional result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The list is really important because, once it is entered—under the old ethic behind the list system—a voter expresses a preference for a party. It is up to the political parties to draw up the lists and submit them, and they then become immutable. However, let us suppose that one of the people on the list commits an indiscretion and decides to resign from the party, or one of the candidates contravenes party rules and is expelled during that period, the list system allows people the opportunity to vote for a party. Otherwise, if, between submission of the list and election day, one of the candidates on the list ceases to be a member of the party, the people will have been misled. If a party list has been submitted, would it not be possible in some way to ensure that if, between then and the election, a person on the list ceases to be a party member, he or she can no longer receive a party vote and his or her name will be excluded?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can answer that question directly. The same conditions apply to every individual who enters the election system. If someone is put forward as an individual in a constituency, he or she is the candidate. It is not for the electoral system to deal with party discipline. The difference is that if someone is subsequently added to the list to replace an individual who has died or resigned, the party then has an opportunity to say that the new candidate is no longer a member of the party. During the election, it is exactly the same; the election period is the election period once the nomination has been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With all due respect to my right hon. Friend, if a person stands as a party candidate and if something happens during the nominations period, it is quite possible to promote the idea that that person is no longer the party candidate. Is it not entirely different under a list system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Once an individual has been nominated—through the constituency or under a list system—he or she is in place for the election. The difference is that the list, rather than the by-election, may be used for appointing people where someone subsequently resigns or dies. In such a circumstance, the party may decide that an individual is no longer a representative of the party. Therefore, we cannot deal with the matter in terms of the direct election period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further point that may help my hon. Friend. The provisions for rejected ballot papers will make it clear to returning officers that they can accept regoinal ballot papers on which the voter has placed a mark or marks in the voting box for a party, and against the name of candidates on the party's fist. Returning officers will also be able to accept a ballot paper on which the voter has not marked the voting box, but has placed marks against the name of one or more candidates on the same list. A ballot paper on which marks have been placed for one party, and beside the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
names of the candidates for another party, would not be accepted because the voter's intention would not be clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraphs 66 to 68 provide for vacancies in a constituency to be filled through a by-election, unless the vacancy occurred three months or less before the next ordinary election, there is no provision for regional by-elections. Where a list member dies or vacates his seat, the next candidate on the list would normally fill the seat. If the regional member was an independent, the seat would remain vacant until the next election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point concerns recounts at constituency elections to which schedule 5(51) refers. Most of paragraph 52 has been deleted.

Members because I circulated a copy of the document to every hon. Member who represents a Welsh constituency. The time for debate may be brief, but the time for comment and question, which has been taken by hon. Members and others, has provided an extended opportunity for debate and discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the reference to individuals as he or she, the document was prepared according to the drafting convention for Acts of Parliamentary and statutory instruments and the hon. Gentleman should address his comments to the authorities of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have not been able to examine the document carefully because a huge number of pages appeared only a few days ago and have already been altered. What confidence can we have that the document is right when it seems that legislation is being made on the hoof? I do not want to be cheeseparing, but I wish that my hon. Friend would insist that the pages in such documents are numbered and that split infinitives are omitted. If there is a split infinitive in the English
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0072">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
version, how confident is my right hon. Friend that the Welsh version will stand up to scrutiny. Election law is fairly precise and different returning officers in Wales will be trying to interpret the rules in a short space of time. If I have a fear, and this is a serious point, it is that there is a lacuna—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] We all sometimes make points that are not serious because they are statements. How much confidence can we have that there will be no upsets because of imperfections in the order or its Welsh translation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perfection is difficult to achieve. The legislation has certainly not been made on the hoof and I am tempted to say that such a suggestion is speech-making on the hoof. There has been much thought, consideration, consultation and redrafting when appropriate, following the comments that have been made. The hon. Gentleman has had plenty of opportunity to comment on the previous drafts and I have been through the document to highlight where changes have been made as a result of consultation. That is why I had to spell it out to the Committee and ensure that hon. Members know exactly what stage we have reached. I am confident that the document and the translation are as good as possible. Only a foolish person would be 100 per cent, confident that a draft contained no mistakes—a clerical error led to part of one clause, which had been correctly drafted, being left out accidentally. I am confident, however, that the officials and all those involved in the process have gone to great lengths to come as close to perfection as possible, given that there are difficult decisions to make and complex arrangements to agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee long, as we have only an hour and a half to consider this complex statutory instrument. We should have had the opportunity for wider debate. The fact that we have not had such an oppportunity shows how little time is allowed for parliamentary scrutiny of the great number of statutory instruments that pass through Parliament. That problem needs to be addressed, and I hope that the National Assembly will have the opportunity for proper scrutiny of such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that the number of people barred from standing for the Welsh Assembly has been kept as low as 5,000. I hope that the list of those disqualified will continue to be available to hon. Members. For some people, it may come as a surprise to find that they are disqualified from standing for the Assembly. What information will be given to people working for disqualified bodies? Will any appeal structure be put in place to allow the First Secretary or the Secretary of State to alter the disqualification list in future?

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that. I hope that the bodies will disseminate the information to the relevant people—5,000 is a large number. It is necessary to clarify whether everyone working for the Forestry Commission is barred, or whether only those at a certain level in the pecking order are barred. The bodies must clarify those matters to their employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the second order is taken from the representation of the people Acts. Many of us are conversant with certain sections of those Acts because we have been candidates in the past. It is a shame that rolling lists have not been considered, because we need as many people voting in the Assembly elections as possible. The Welsh Office is spending £2.5 million on advertising the elections and the system of election, which—judging by interchanges between the Secretary of State and his right hon. and hon. Friends who were trying to work out whether someone at the top of the list would be elected or whether it could be someone at the bottom—will be complicated. What happens when someone dies? Will a by-election no longer be necessary?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issues, too are complicated. For example, it would be a grave mistake to give any more information than will be available on the regional ballot paper. Where would we stop? Would we put an explanation of the d'Hondt system at the top for people to read? Chairs would be needed in polling stations, where people could sit for two hours as they worked their way through the d'Hondt system. It is very complicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that the count will take place on a Friday, when people will have has a good night's sleep and will be able to work their way through the counting of the votes. Many of us who have been up until 3, 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning, even during our own simple counts, welcome the fact that the ballots will be counted by people with fresh eyes who have had a decent sleep the night before—they will need it, if they are to work out the various systems. I feel sorry for Peter Snow. When he starts to use his swingometer to illustrate the regional list and the d'Hondt system, people will become very confused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the Secretary of State has any idea of what time the count will start on the Friday, and of when the results will start to come through. I believe that people will be interested in the elections, as they are the first elections to the Welsh Assembly. Therefore, they will be interested in when the results will come through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful that, through negotiations between the parties, we have been able to adopt our own symbols for Wales. Initially, there was a suspicion that we should be able to have only one symbol. We have one symbol for the Conservative party for the whole of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0073">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
United Kingdom, but we have a different symbol for Wales and we are delighted that we will be given the opportunity to display it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears that the usual polling stations will be used. Will the Secretary of State consider the reforms suggested by his party to make polling stations more accessible? It has been proposed that places such as supermarkets where people normally go should be used. That would make it easier for them to vote. Such advances would be useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the Secretary of State received any representations from organisations for the disabled—for example, SCOPE—about the accessibility of polling stations to disabled people? That is an issue on which we must make progress. Changes would not cost a great deal. We are talking about simple things as sufficient lighting in polling stations, and about the tables on which the ballot boxes stand being at such a height that someone in a wheelchair can put a voting paper into the ballot box. SCOPE has compiled reports on access to polling stations. I hope that the Secretary of State will have the opportunity to read them and to ensure that some of its recommendations will be implemented in order to achieve the inclusivity that we want, and to increase the number of people able to vote for themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Secretary of State comment on the recount system, which has been briefly mentioned? A great deal of discretion is left to the returning officer. During the referendum for the Welsh Assembly, there was no facility for recounts. I believe that many people suspect that had there been such a facility, we would not be having this debate today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wish to ensure that there is no suspicion, as there has been in the past, that anything could go wrong. Where discretion is available, there are always problems. What will the facility for recounts be, particularly in the case of the regional list where there may be confusion with the d'Hondt divisor as to whether one candidate or another has been elected? We wish to ensure that problems can be dealt with properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A lead has been taken from general elections regarding the expenses of individual candidates, with an increase allowing for inflation. Will the Secretary of State comment on the information that people on the list system will be able to send out? For example, individual candidates send out information, as do candidates on the list. Will a party's candidates on the list be required to send out the same information to every voter, so that they all have to adhere to whatever that message is? Alternatively, will the candidates on the list be able to send out several leaflets, sending different messages to different people—for example, different target groups—if they have been able to ascertain where they live. If it is elderly people, they will want to send one message; if it is young people, they will want to send another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
Was any thought given to increasing the amount that list or regional candidates will be able to spend during the election for the National Assembly because of the harder task that they will have in getting their message across?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Secretary of State knows, there will be many confusing messages directing people to vote for one party in a constituency and for another on the list. Target voting, of which we all are aware in general elections, will occur in elections for the National Assembly. We have an educated electorate and it will not take people long to work out how to get their message across by tactical voting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a few short points. The Secretary of State said that the issue of disqualification will affect only a few members and employees of certain organisations. However, there is a need for more enlightenment among employers in both the private and public sectors to enable more people to stand for election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been denied such opportunities, but I spent some time working for ICI where the chance to stand for election was open to any employee. The company might have adopted that enlightened policy because Sir Alfred Mond was the Liberal Member for Carmarthen at one time. Amazingly, however, 70 or 80 years after ICI first adopted such a policy, some companies consider that employees should not stand for election. Even worse, people who fail to be elected cannot get their position back or even secure employment in the same organisation. A message needs to go out to employers in Wales that that is not the way to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the Welsh Office on its drafting of the documents—they are complex and a lot of hard work has gone into their production. I thank the civil servants of the Welsh Office for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a Liberal Democrat, I welcome the element of proportional representation mentioned in the documents. The system to be used is not the one that we would have adopted—we would have preferred open lists. Closed lists are proposed, but I am glad that the names of candidates will at least appear on the ballot paper. All that I make is a plea for a clear explanation of how the result will be calculated. That information should be clearly displayed. The arrangements have to be explained very clearly to those who will vote under the system for the first time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The declaration will take place on a Friday: join the club—declarations always take place in my constituency on Fridays. I call it a continent rather than a constituency because it is such a vast area. It is difficult to get all the votes in from the far-flung corners of its 87-mile length. Does the Secretary of State know on what day of the week the declaration will occur in Scotland? Will it be on a Thursday rather than a Friday, or will it be the same as in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I should perhaps describe it instead as a black farce or a tragi-comedy. Clearly, the internal wranglings of the Labour party have burst into the open, and that is not appropriate. [Hon. Members: "No."] I shall not embarrass the Secretary of State—not within these four walls but perhaps on another occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad about the changes. A range of people who should be allowed to stand for the National Assembly will now be allowed to stand. It would have been a serious failure had people who work for the NHS and for the public sector in various capacities not been allowed to stand. We need to bring such people into the activities of the National Assembly and its committees. That will be an important change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, some people have to be debarred, and there is good sense in the list that has been provided. However, in future it might be worth looking at the possibility of allowing people to stand without having to resign their positions. Then they would resign their positions only if they were elected. That seems simpler. I think that the Secretary of State said that there might be conflicts of interest even during the campaigning period, and there may be some substance in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to read that candidates on the list only have to have one agent. We once thought that there might be an agent for each candidate, which would obviously have been wasteful and complicated. It is good that those on the list have to pay only one deposit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the fact that concessions have been made on our suggestion that it is permissible to send only one piece of literature through the post. Apart from anything else, that will save paper, reduce energy costs and lessen the environmental impact. Those are considerations that we should always bear in mind.

My final point is about the description of Plaid Cymru as "the party of Wales". Suggestions have been made that that is an inappropriate name for Plaid Cymru. It is absolutely appropriate—it is a direct translation of what "Plaid Cymru" means. If asked what party was being referred to by that phrase, I am sure that 80 or 90 per cent, of people in Wales would say, "Oh yes, of course that means Plaid Cymru."

	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the permission of the Committee, I will write to hon. Members about points that I cannot answer now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that returning officers must designate polling places taking account of the needs of disabled people, and the application of section 18 of the Representation of the Peoples Act 1983. The counting is generally intended to start at 9.30 am, with a result by lunch-time, on the Friday. As far as rolling lists are concerned, our powers are sufficient only to replicate the existing system with necessary amendments, not to create a new set of arrangements for registration. Several points have been raised for which one would clearly have to return to the primary legislation, rather than trying to change things through the order-making powers that we are using.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recounts are possible at constituency level—for a constituency vote and for the regional list—and that is where any challenge would have to be made. It would not be practical to have a complete regional recount across seven or eight constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system will allow the use of supermarkets, but other changes suggested by hon. Members may require primary legislation. The proposed arrangements for the designation of polling booths may make them more accessible than they have been, but primary legislation will be necessary to make more comprehensive changes.
