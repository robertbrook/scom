	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office(Mr. Edward Rowlands)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Committee have considered the draft African Development Bank (Privileges) Order 1978."</p></blockquote>
With your permission, Mr. Wells, and the concurrence of the Committee, I shall speak at the same time to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group (Immunities and Privileges) Order 1978. These orders, which will be made under the International Organisations Act 1968, were laid before the House on 23rd November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal first with the African Development Bank order. The purpose of the order is to confer corporate status on the bank and to exempt the bank from taxes on income and capital gains. The draft order is required to give effect to the agreement between Her Majesty's Government and the African Development Bank concerning the status and privileges of the office of the bank in London. This agreement, in the form of an exchange of notes, was laid before the House on 12th October. It is not yet in force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The African Development Bank is a regional development bank which was established in 1963. Its membership consists exclusively of African States and it has its headquarters at Abidjan. The bank's aims are to promote development projects for the economic and social advancement of its member States. It has an active policy to aid the poorest sectors by promoting the growth of agriculture and rural development. These aims are, of course, in line with our own aid policy and therefore deserve our support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That support is evidenced by the fact that, although the United Kingdom is not presently a member of the Bank—although it might be in the future—we, along with
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
most Western nations, are a member of the African Development Fund. The fund was set up in 1973 to supplement the activities of the bank. It provides finance on concessional terms for those members of the bank which need "soft" loans for the development of their countries. In May 1973 Parliament approved an order granting certain privileges and immunities to the fund under section 1(1) of the International Organisations Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bank has its headquarters at Abidjan, as I have said, but it was decided to open a European office in London so that it can establish close links with the principal financial markets of Europe in its quest for and procurement of funds for the bank's members. It will not, of course, have authorised bank status and cannot therefore operate as a bank. It will act as a collector and disseminator of information on capital movements and on economic information of direct significance to its members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft order now before Parliament is the first which it is proposed to make under section 4 of the International Organisations Act, which relates to organisations of which the United Kingdom is not a member. Section 4 enables only legal personality and exemption from certain direct taxes to be accorded. The order makes no provision for immunity from jurisdiction or for the grant of tax privileges to individuals. The effect of the order on the exchequer is therefore likely to be minimal, since the nature of the bank's work here is such that it is not likely to generate any taxable income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the order relating to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group. This order is required to enable us to sign and give effect to an agreement, laid before the House on 17th October, with the International Lead and Zinc Study Group relating to its headquarters in London. The agreement, which will come into force on signature, provides that the group shall have legal personality and that such privileges and immunities as are necessary for an international organisation of this nature to function efficiently shall be accorded to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The International Lead and Zinc Study Group was set up as a result of discussions, held in 1958 and 1959 under United Nations auspices, between representatives of countries which were substantially interested in the production or consump-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0429">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
tion of lead and zinc or in trade in these metals. The group's function is to provide a forum for the exchange and collection of statistical and technical information to assist the industries in the countries concerned in planning towards matching the supply and demand of both metals. Over 30 countries, including the United Kingdom, are now members of the group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lead and zinc are metals essential to our industries. But the amount we mine is very small in relation to our consumption. We therefore have to import almost the whole of our requirements. It is thus in our best interests that there is stability in production, trade and price, and to this end we take an active part in the group's deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On its establishment, the group was provided by the United Nations with free accommodation and services at the United Nations secretariat building in New York. Subsequently, the decision was taken to move the headquarters to London in order to give better access to the other international commodity organisations already established here. The group has been here since April last year. It has a small staff of only five persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft order provides for privileges and immunities to be accorded to the group on a scale similar to those accorded to other international commodity organisations of which we are a member. Hon. Members will be glad to note that the order excludes immunity from suit and legal process in the case of motor traffic offences, which, of course, include parking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that hon. Members will accept the draft order, thereby demonstrating their support for the valuable work of the International Lead and Zinc Study Group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.35 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his introductory remarks and assure the Committee that I shall not detain it for long on the two orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin by making a general point, which is really a question to the Minister. He and the Committee will have noted the substantial difference in the length of the two orders and the different treatment that the two international organisations are being given in respect of immunities and privileges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They are both international bodies. Clearly, there must be a special reason why the International Lead and Zinc Study Group has been given far more
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
substantial privileges for its representatives. I should be grateful if the Minister would indicate the criteria that are applied to determine the extent of the immunities and privileges granted to the members of international organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note the Minister's explanation as to why the African Development Bank now wishes to open an office in London. Is London the only European centre from which the bank wishes to operate or, in the light of its decision—I believe in May of this year—to open the bank's capital to non-African countries, is this simply part of a general process of opening offices throughout the Western world and developed countries as a whole?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are delighted that the International Lead and Zinc Study Group has chosen to move its headquarters to London. This emphasises the extent to which London is becoming the commodity centre of the world. I come now to one or two questions on the order. The Minister said that there will be five people employed in the group's London centre. Would he indicate what is the total number of people who have immunity, in one form or another, under diplomatic status in the United Kingdom at the present time? I understand that earlier this year the figure was in the region of 5,000 people, plus their families, who had either complete or partial diplomatic status. Obviously, that is a substantial number. If there is to be a growing number of international organisations—not embassies—granted such privileges, that could have substantial significance in respect of their overall position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will note that article 6(1) of the draft headquarters agreement relating to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government undertake to assist the Group in the acquisition of promises by gift, purchase or lease or in the hire of premises at such time as they may be needed."</p></blockquote>
May we be told exactly what is meant by that assistance? Will the British Government meet the cost of the premises, or is it simply a question of giving the group advice and help towards the acquisition of premises?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next, I come to a matter which, on the face of it, seems to show a certain inconsistency. Both in the draft agreement and in the order it is made clear that the privileges and immunities provided for order will not apply to United Kingdom citizens who are employed by the bank
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0430">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
and by the international group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us how many of those five people to be employed by the study group are likely to be United Kingdom citizens. Why is this distinction always insisted upon in agreements of this kind? The Minister will note from the draft agreement that article 16(3) excludes United Kingdom citizens but article 16(4) immediately goes on to say that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Privileges and immunities are accorded to representatives in order to ensure complete independence in the exercise of their functions in connection with the Group."</p></blockquote>
If it is necessary to provide diplomatic immunity in order to ensure the complete independence of those employees, surely, the citizens of the country in which the group is situated are the people most requiring some form of guarantee to ensure that complete independence. If there were to be any form of improper pressure, it would be most likely to be imposed on the citizens of the country in which the organisation is established, not in other countries. If the Minister could indicate the reasoning behind that exclusion, I should be grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to my final question. The Minister stated that the privileges and immunities accorded to the study group under the order are similar to those provided under similar commodity agreements. There are, however, substantial differences between the immunities and privileges being granted under this order and those granted under the International Rubber Study Group (Immunities and Privileges) Order which was approved by the House earlier this year. I understand that the major difference is that the Lead and Zinc Study Group is to have inviolability of its premises, which was not accorded to the International Rubber Study Group, and also that representatives of member Governments of the Lead and Zinc Study Group are to enjoy
	<br><blockquote><p>"immunity from personal arrest or detention and from seizure of their personal baggage"—</p></blockquote>
that is, diplomatic exemptions and privileges in respect of their personal baggage— in addition to the other immunities enjoyed by representatives of the International Rubber Study Group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As both these organisations are commodity groups which appear to have exactly the same function in respect of their
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
particular commodities, why are additional immunities and privileges felt to be necessary for the Lead and Zinc Study Group? One would wish to keep the granting of such immunities to a minimum. If the Rubber Study Group was satisfied with the immunities granted to it, why cannot similar criteria apply to the Lead and Zinc Study Group?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.41 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to reply to all the questions raised by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind). First, he asked about the difference between the privileges extended to the two organisations subject to the two orders. In my opening remarks I pointed out the difference between the two. In the case of the bank, we are not members of that organisation and therefore it is covered under section 4 of the International Organisations Act 1968, which compels us to limit the privileges granted to any such organisation of which we are not members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, the hon. Gentleman asked whether the bank might establish other offices under its announced policy of opening its membership to non-African members. That is still under discussion but, to our knowledge, the bank is not opening in any other capitals at present. We cannot, of course, forecast its future policy, but we are pleased that the bank has chosen London as the headquarters for its operations in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised the question of the role or position of United Kingdom citizens employed by organisations such as the study group, and why they also were not granted immunities and privileges. I can tell him that four of the five are United Kingdom citizens anyway, though that does not mean that the pattern will remain the same in the future. Exclusion of nationals of the host State from immunity is the common form. The exclusion applies also, I am glad to say, to diplomats. Otherwise, it would mean—I am just thinking aloud—that United Kingdom diplomats who returned home to work in the Foreign Office, for example, would enjoy the immunities that they had in their work abroad. That applies to all United Kingdom citizens; they have no immunities in such circumstances. It has always been standard form, therefore, that we exclude nationals of the host State from such privileges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0431">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do other countries have the same rule?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the standard form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the acquisition of premises. No financial assistance is involved—only advice and help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next, the hon. Gentleman asked about the number of people in the United Kingdom enjoying diplomatic privileges and immunities of various kinds. A total of 2,409 officials in London, with their families, are entitled to full diplomatic immunities and privileges. This number includes only nine representatives of international organisations, other than the Commonwealth Secretariat which is equated by Act of Parliament to a diplomatic mission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further 2,814 officials in London are entitled to the more restricted privileges and immunities. As regards staff members of international organisations, 747 in all, immunity is limited to their official acts only, and they enjoy no privileges other than exemption from United Kingdom income tax on their emoluments which are subject to internal tax for the benefit of the organisation. Provided that they are neither citizens of the United Kingdom nor permanent residents, they are also allowed a Customs franchise on their furniture and personal effects imported at the time of their installation in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member that there is a growing number of people working in London who enjoy privileges and immunities of varying kinds. It is an indication of the growth of London as a centre for international organisations, and we generally welcome it. For example, we are glad to see the way in which international organisations dealing with commodities now see London as a base and headquarters from which to operate. Therefore, although the figures may sound alarming when given coldly, if they are seen in the context of the development of London as the centre of international organisations, we should in general welcome them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. Gentleman raised the question of the difference between the privileges that we are granting to this study group and those accorded to the International Rubber Study Group, which are far less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there is the question of inviolability of premises; second, there is the
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
question of immunity of baggage—not of officials but of representatives. It is important to make that distinction. I accept in some ways that these privileges and immunities have grown up in a patchwork fashion. As regards the International Rubber Study Group, which has been established here, chaired by a United Kingdom citizen, and has worked satisfactorily, though originally with no immunities, for a very long time, in the order passed last year by the House we gave privileges to the organisation and it was content with the limited immunities and privileges we offered. It was the subject of discussion and was agreed. The group was content with such arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of the Lead and Zinc Study Group, a different situation applied. It had decided to transfer its premises from New York, where it had enjoyed these privileges at the existing premises. It made the decision to move to London. I should add that there was considerable competition and there were other possibilities. One felt that one should, while recognising that we do not readily extend privileges and immunities, offer at least what it had enjoyed in respect of premises and immunity of baggage for representatives in New York.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that to be a reasonable proposition in relation to immunity of baggage. Many of these representatives are also members of other groups who already enjoy such privileges and immunities in performing their role in those other international organisations. Some of them are even diplomats. A curious system would otherwise develop. The moment a person acting as a representative of one of the study groups came in with baggage, he would be told "Your baggage is not covered by immunity or the provisions of the order, but if you came in with your other hat on, it would be covered". We must try to have a measure of conformity. All we have done in this case is provide an order which gives them a modest degree of inviolability of premises and immunity of baggage as has been enjoyed in New York.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sydney Bidwell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would this extend to marking cars with a CD plate? It seems that every other car in London has "CD" on it these days, even when they are quite scruffy vehicles. I wonder if some of them are second-hand cars. Does immunity extend to labelling vehicles of that kind?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0432">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the one hand, the Minister says that there is a desire for conformity and, on the other, he is introducing an order which provides for immunities and privileges different from those accorded to similar international organisations. Is there not an overwhelming case for the Foreign Office or the British Government to rationalise the position as regards members of international organisations? Why should not international representatives be treated as diplomats are? Presumably, all embassies have identical privileges for their diplomatic staff, and there is no difference between one and another in that respect. Surely similar criteria should apply to those international bodies which are not embassies, which do not have full diplomatic status but which, for very good reasons, have to be given certain immunities and privileges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be for historical reasons that different powers have been granted to different people, but it seems to pose an intolerable burden on Customs and other officials of the United Kingdom. When persons from abroad enter this country those officials, presumably, now not only have to look to see what international organisation the visitors belong to but have to make a detailed study of the immunities and privileges granted to the particular international organisation to determine whether a person or his baggage should be searched or other action can be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If two individuals arrive, one representative of the International Lead and Zinc Study Group and along with him a friend who is a representative of the International Rubber Study Group, it seems extraordinary that they should be in a different position with regard to certain of their rights and privileges in this country. There is no rational reason for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the Ministers explanation that we do not want to insist on action that would drive this study group away from London, but it seems to me that it is about time the Government began to try to rationalise the system so that even if it were the highest common denominator, we should know that all people in similar organisations had similar immunities and privileges. This would make life far simpler for our officials, and presumably would not be resented by anyone for any legitimate reason.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point, except that it would be like stirring up a hornet's nest to try to withdraw immunities or privileges from an existing organisation which happened to have them granted under orders in the past. Rationalisation would imply withdrawal as well as enhancement of certain privileges and immunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Council of Europe report recommended that each and every organisation should have its immunities and privileges tailored to meet its particular requirements. One should not consider such immunities and privileges to be uniform. The role and work of every organisation should be looked at individually.

Clearly, the hon. Gentleman puts his finger on a significant point when he says that there is no reason why the Rubber Study Group and the Lead and Zinc Study Group should be treated differently. But the rubber group has been well established and, when previous immunities and privileges orders have been discussed, it was content with a limited form. The House has been very jealous in granting immunities and privileges, and if there was agreement on the minimum provisions in that particular order, then, quite rightly, that was the order that was drafted. If we were to press an organisation to have more, the whole Committee would challenge that very point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee, and I understand the point being made by the Minister—that it would be undesirable to embark on an exercise which meant the withdrawal of privileges, which would undoubtedly cause tremendous troubles quite unnecessarily— but the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind) makes a strong point in that we should not be perpetuating new anomalies by what we are doing today. I do not understand why we should be granting different privileges to different organisations and thereby extending the number of anomalies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to offer any opposition on this occasion, but I feel that it might be a good idea for the future to look at the possibility of having some standard practice applied in cases of this sort. Gradually, as privileges are granted for certain categories of people who come here, we could move along certain lines and the system would then be standardised. Although it would take a long time, there

	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
would be a greater move towards uniformity rather than perpetuation of further differences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go wide of these orders but when, especially with regard to our membership of the EEC, we are often asked to impose all sorts of uniformities on long-established practices in this country, it seems rather ridiculous that we should in another sphere be perpetuating differences. I hope that my hon. Friend will take note of that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly note my hon. Friend's point in support of the remarks of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind). But in a sense this order concerning the Lead and Zinc Study Group demonstrates the difficulties of achieving such conformity. Here we have a group which is transferring its headquarters. It is not establishing itself anew, it is not starting from scratch; it has transferred its headquarters from New York to London—a move which we welcome. It enhances London's role with regard to the commodity concerned. It is only a modest enhancement, but it is a useful and important one, and it was a decision taken amid considerable competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the call for a measure of conformity, but when an organisation already enjoying considerable immunities or privileges in respect of its operations in another capital is transferring itself to London, and we are keen to have it, then, tough and jealous as we might be in granting those privileges, we should nevertheless be prepared to tailor-make the provisions to meet the needs of that
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
organisation in the light of its past or existing experience. As the hon. Gentleman has pointed out, that may lead us to create different provisions for this group from, for example, those for the International Rubber Study Group, which has been well established here, since they perhaps did not throw up the same arguments and issues as the provisions for this group have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I understand and take note of the point made by my hon. Friend and the hon. Gentleman, I merely point out that in practice, although conformity is desirable and one should try to maintain it, in a particular case—this one is an example— one finds that anomalies or differences arise between the provisions in one order and those in a previous order for a similar group. That should not deter us or prevent us from continuing to endeavour to make London as attractive as possible as a centre for such international organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
