	<br><blockquote><p>"(4A) In deciding whether it is essential in the interests of the public to exercise their powers under subsections (1) or (2) the traffic commissioners shall have regard to the duties imposed on—

	<ol>

	<li>passenger transport authorities and executives by section 9 of the Transport Act 1978;</li>

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In these amendments we come to the fundamental issue of how far the powers of the commissioners which can be exercised under the clause could, unless that is done with regard to certain statutory obligations resting on local authorities, cut across and make nonsense of specified local authority passenger responsibilities. At present a number of local authorities have specific duties laid on them under various legislation to promote certain objectives relating to passenger transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 104, along with amendment No. 103, paves the way for the significant proposal in amendment No. 99(
	<i>a</i>), which is that the commissioners, in deciding whether to exercise their powers
	<span class='label label-info column'>782</span>
under subsections (3) and (4) of the clause,
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall have regard to the duties imposed on passenger transport authorities and executives"</p></blockquote>
by the parts of legislation that are mentioned in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe it is significant that the powers under subsections (3) and (4) are governed by precise words. Subsection (3) states that the commissioners:
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall not exercise their powers under subsection (1) or their powers of alteration under subsection (2) in any particular case unless satisfied that the proposed exercise of those powers in that case is essential in the interests of the public".</p></blockquote>
That does not mean the public interest in general, but in two specific ways—that is, it could be affected by a holder's unreasonable use of his licence, or it could be damaged by competition between stage carriage services on the same routes. The way in which the traffic commissioner has to use his powers is quite clearly defined up to that point. He has to be convinced that it is essential in those specific interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the clause does not deal with the important issue that we have raised in the clauses—that is, whether, in deciding what it is essential to do, the commissioner will have regard to the clear statutory obligations that lie upon local authorities, which affect the passenger transport services of the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to refer to three of those obligations. I understand that my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) has a particular interest in a fourth. I shall not deal with that because I do not want to duplicate part of his case. First, there is section 9 of the Transport Act 1968. I should like to make clear that we are considering a range of types of authority. The local authorities that are primarily concerned are those established by local government reorganisation. In the case of regional and island councils in Scotland there is a specific provision, and for the metropolitan counties there is another specific provision in law as to their responsibilities and duties. In the case of the metropolitan counties it appears to me that the obligation in law rests between the passenger transport authority together with the passenger transport executive, but if that is not correct perhaps that will be straightened out in the course of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It also seems to me that Greater London is not involved because the traffic commissioners are not in any case concerned
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0431">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>783</span>
with fixing the fares for safe services in the London area. Therefore, we are talking about specific types of local authority responsibility and I should like to deal first with that which is covered, for passenger transport authorities and executives, by section 9 of the Transport Act 1968. I shall not weary the Committee by going through the whole of section 9 but I wish to quote that part of subsection (3) that seems to be totally relevant. That says
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the case of each designated area it shall be the general duty—

	<ol>

	<li>of the Authority so to exercise and perform the functions with respect to the general policy to be followed by the Executive conferred on the Authority by the provisions of this Part of this Act, and</li>

	<li>of the Executive so to exercise and perform their functions under this Part of the Act and section 24(2) thereof with respect to the provision of passenger transport services, as to secure or promote the provision of a properly integrated and efficient system of public passenger transport to meet the needs of that area with due regard to the town planning".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
It goes on to mention other of their specific responsibilities as an authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that that makes crystal clear that these local authorities—the county authorities—have a clear obligation laid upon them to exercise their powers in a way that will bring about a properly integrated passenger transport system within their areas. It seems to me—and this is the purpose of the amendment—that it will be impossible for them to do that if the traffic commissioners in taking decisions under the clause have no regard for it, because they could take decisions that could cut right across arrangements made or objectives that had been defined by the local authority when they were carrying out their duties under that section of the Transport Act. Later I shall come to exactly how the commissioners' decisions on these matters may do exactly that, but in this instance these are decisions on the attachment of conditions to fares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next piece of legislation that lays down a similar provision, but in this case for the non-metropolitan county councils, is contained in section 1 of the Transport Act 1978. It is easy to quote from that as the words are stated at the outset of the Act which reads
	<br><blockquote><p>"In each non-metropolitan county of England and Wales, it shall be the duty—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(
	<i>a</i>) of the county council, acting in consultation with public passenger transport service operators and district councils within the county—</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>784</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>(i) to develop policies which will promote the provision of a co-ordinated and efficient system of public passenger transport to meet the county's needs".</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say that for that purpose they should take appropriate steps to promote co-ordination, amalgamation and even reorganisation of road transport services. Further, it requires each of the district councils in the county which provide any passenger transport services—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the right hon. Gentleman explain the relevance of this to fares?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. I do not believe that you had the advantage, Mr. English, of hearing my original submission to the point. If I may reiterate—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not allow the right hon. Gentleman to repeat himself. He is talking to an amendment to a clause that relates solely to conditions as to fares.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The amendment is designed to require the traffic commissioners, in taking decisions that effect the variation of fares, to have regard to certain specific obligations contained in legislation specified in the amendment, which relate to the duties, obligations and objectives set by the House for local authorities in promoting passenger transport policies and plans for their own areas. It is to the extent that the failure of the commissioner to take that into account, or the extent to which the ignoring by the commissioner of this duty laid upon the local authorities could cut across the local authority's ability to carry out the plan—or, as I shall argue later, make it impossible for them to carry out those duties—that the section of the Act that I was quoting is, I contend, relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, Mr. English, it would be impossible for those non-metropolitan counties in England and Wales
	<br><blockquote><p>"to develop policies which will promote the provision of a co-ordinated and efficient system of public passenger transport"</p></blockquote>
unless they could make arrangements that would ensure that a combination of fares and contribution from the transport support grant which they arrange with the Minister resulted in the development of those policies which it is their duty to promote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0432">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>785</span>
In other words, if, having come to a specific arrangement—let us say, in the case of a single bus service which was part of their overall policy, to take the simplest case—the arrangement existing between this non-metropolitan county authority and the operator was that he should provide so much of the revenue towards maintaining the service from a specific fares arrangement, and the council should provide so much under its transport support grant arrangement, and, without regard for that, the commissioner were to make an alteration or adjustment of fares, by doing so he could wreck an arrangement which the local authority had reached under a specific duty laid upon it by Parliament. That follows from the provision, in the case of a non-metropolitan country council, in section 1 of the Transport Act 1978.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further provision in our legislation which affects regional councils, which raises the same issue. That is section 151 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. The part of that Act which appears to me to raise the point—in fact, I have two parts, but I propose to quote from only one—is, first, section 151(1)(
	<i>a</i>) and (3). They are quite specific as to the financial nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 3 says that a local authority may make grants towards the costs of persons involved in carrying passengers, while section 4 says that, in respect of any financial year, a specific contribution out of the rates towards the expenditure required to discharge the functions of the passengers transport services is covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that there is no doubt in the case of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 that when Parliament made provisions for and laid duties upon those local authorities covered by this legislation to promote a co-ordinated passenger transport service in their area and, in the words of the Act
	<br><blockquote><p>"to take such steps to promote the co-ordination, amalgamation and re-organisation … as appear to the local authority to be desirable"</p></blockquote>
that what Parliament had in mind, among other things, was the necessary financial provision and arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I contend that if the commissioners were to make such variations of conditions as to change the bare structure in an area where local authorities are carrying out their statutory duties they could cut right across the aims of our previous legislation. This
	<span class='label label-info column'>786</span>
therefore raises for us a very serious issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If commissioners are to take account of the views of local authorities anyway, logically they must take account of their statutory duties and obligations. Frankly, I should like to see this spelt out much more clearly in the Bill. At least the amendment is specific and relates to requirements which the commissioners would be capable of reading and, I think, taking into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has argued, at the end of a number of our debates on amendments, that in the final analysis, if we are in doubt about these matters, we should consider the interest of the public as paramount—in this case, the public who want to be able to use the public transport services in the local authority areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that those who man the local authorities, the metropolitan authorities, the passenger transport executives and the county councils are accountable to the public. Many of them have, in the course of their standing for election, advocated policies bearing directly on the fares to be charged. In fact, my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) and I, when visiting Yorkshire, talked to the South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Authority and had this brought very much to our attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This dissertation on the right hon. Gentleman's method of conducting opposition is fascinating, but not relevant to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I complete the sentence, Mr. English?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am sorry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me point to the fares implications of the amendment for South Yorkshire, Mr. English. The policy of the South Yorkshire authority, carrying out its duties under the legislation referred to in the amendment and taking them very seriously, was to say "We can best ensure that our network is maintained, expanded and put to greater public use by having a specific fares policy which will prevent fares from rising". It put it to the test by way of election in the belief that it was a matter of public and political concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the commissioner were exercising powers under this clause to make changes in that fares policy, it is certain that one
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0433">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>787</span>
transport authority would not be able to discharge its duties in the way in which it has chosen to do. I think that I have made the point clearly that there is a direct relationship between fares policy and the local authority's duties as specified in legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman may have established a connection between the fares policy and the integrated transport policy requirements, but is there not a much greater relationship, let us say, between the granting of licences at all, and the amendment would be more relevant attached to earlier clauses, not necessarily in relation to fares?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is not the right hon. Gentleman's query resolved by the requirement in clause 5 for the traffic commissioners to take into account the transport requirements of the area as a whole and the general transport policies or plans to be made for that area? Are they not already obliged to take into account the sort of factors that the right hon. Gentleman has in mind?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is intending to help the Committee, but I should be glad if the right hon. Gentleman did not reply to him because it would lead him out of the context of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am staying strictly within the context of the amendment. I have to deal only with those aspects of the traffic commissioners' function relating to fares and the attachment of conditions to the road service licence. But in that area the traffic commissioners have a different sort of power from that which they have for making other changes in licensing conditions and which we have dealt with under previous clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Variations in powers could occur within a year or a shorter period and therefore could wreck financing arrangements dependent on fare conditions of services that were a part of a policy for transport planning. I suggest that it would become impossible for the Minister to achieve the arrangements referred to in the amendment arrangements that I am sure he is seeking to reach on an annual basis with the local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under those arrangements the local authorities could be assured that their own financial arrangements were sufficient to
	<span class='label label-info column'>788</span>
enable them to make arrangements with the transport companies affected and for the transport companies to have the confidence that fare conditions would not be varied within that period without due regard to these important matters. That is the basis of the amendment, and its ramifications are enormous in regard to the operation of services. They touch upon the most difficult question of how the services are to be financed. If we did not have a quarrel about the spread of finance in the services, no doubt we could all work miracles with the passenger transport system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we do have problems, and we have to strike a balance between what fares can be guaranteed under the licensing conditions and what can be obtained from the ratepayer and taxpayer under the arrangements made by the Minister. Therefore, I commend the amendments to the Committee in the belief that they touch upon a very important area of the Bill which is of enormous significance to the whole of our passenger transport policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not take long, but I think that my right hon. Friend was arguing an important point of principle. The three amendments are of a piece, but the important one is amendment No. 99. The amendments seek to make the fare-arranging powers provided in subsections (1) and (2) consistent with statutory financial obligations of established undertakings. That is the principle of the amendment because it argues specifically that one cannot have fare arrangements without financial repercussions elsewhere, especially when there are existing obligations of a statutory nature which have to be assumed under various Acts of Parliament by transport bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not labour through all the examples, but in amendment No. 99 four bodies are mentioned, in (
	<i>a</i>), (
	<i>b</i>), (
	<i>c</i>) and (
	<i>d</i>). I want to take paragraphs (
	<i>b</i>) and (
	<i>d</i>). I was not sure whether the point put by the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) when he intervened covered the case. I thought not. I believe that we are on a different point. However, if he thinks that he is still right, perhaps he will interrupt me again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) of amendment No. 99 states that the traffic commissioners shall have regard to the statutory financial
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0434">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>789</span>
responsibilities of non-metropolitan counties when they have to make certain financial arrangements with regard to their transport affairs. That is the link between the fares and the financial arrangements. The traffic commissioners have the powers to arrange and alter arrangements with regard to fares, but that power has financial repercussions elsewhere, which is what the amendment covers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a complex point, Mr. English. When I sought to make a complex point this morning on another clause I made a total mess of it and you ruled me out of order. I shall endeavour to do better this time, but at 1.55 in the morning I fear that that may not be possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote the example that I know best, the Suffolk county council. I know a little of the nuts and bolts of that council. The county councils are responsible for promoting and co-ordinating services under TPPs and rolling five-year plans under section 2 of the 1978 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finance has a crucial role to play here and fare-fixing powers have an effect on finance. That is the connection. The county council has to make a financial framework of arrangements. It has to arrange, for example, and discuss with certain parties the cross-subsidy of routes lest unprofitable services are lost to the transport framework altogether. It has to fit in with the allocation of public money under the transport grant. In fact, it has to do a series of deals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the traffic commissioners fix fares that affect the level of profitability, it is obvious that the financial framework that I have described will be affected and, therefore, so will the level of services. That is a complex chain of argument and I hope that I have made it clear. If I have not, I should have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second example that I want to take is paragraph (
	<i>d</i>) of the amendment which relates to the National Bus Company and its subsidiaries. This is an even more important example. The financial obligations of the National Bus Company are categorical. The link between the arrangements for fares made by traffic commissioners and the financial imperatives that must motivate the National Bus Company stand out in sharp relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the Committee to section 41(2) of the Transport Act 1968, which is specifically referred to in the amendment. That is where the link occurs between the fares and
	<span class='label label-info column'>790</span>
the financial obligations. The subsection states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of each of the authorities to whom this section applies so to perform their functions under the Act of 1962 or this Act as to secure that the combined revenues of the authority and of their subsidiaries taken together are not less than sufficient to meet their combined charges properly chargeable to revenue account, taking one year with another."</p></blockquote>
The arrangements made about fares directly apply to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Considering that we have a Government dedicated to the principles of competition, the Bill is a paper tiger. I expect to see the hon. Member for Faversham on his feet when we debate clause stand part because the amendment refers to subsections (1) and (2) where, within a new competitive framework of government, we still have administrative regulation of fares. Competition has nothing to do with administrative regulation of fares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
2 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Faversham made a speech in response to what I said on an earlier clause. He argued clearly that the economic principle is to regulate the fare levels in relation to the cost of providing the service. From where he sits and judged by his economic views, his argument is all of a piece. But there is nothing in the Bill about fixing fares according to costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The traffic commissioners make administrative, and not economic, decisions. They are not concerned with costs. Some of the decisions on fares made by traffic commissioners are weird and wonderful and totally inconsistent between one area and another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not continue with this line of argument, except to say that it strikes me that the Government, in being committed to a more competitive framework to which the amendment relates, seem to have a love-hate relationship with competition. They are quite vague about the dividing line to be drawn between the social and economic consequences. That is one of the confusions running right through the Bill. It is neither one thing nor the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a saying in politics that he who walks in the middle of the road gets run over. That is precisely what has happened to parts of the Bill because in philosophical conception it has a mix which will not stand scrutiny in the light of day. I expect some

	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the problems that the Government face in relation to this trio of amendments, of which two are of no great significance as they are drafting amendments—amendment No. 99 is the material one—I pause for a moment to welcome the return of the Parliamentary Secretary—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman intends to throw some light on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall endeavour to do so, Mr. English. The basic problem of the Bill without amendment No. 99 concerns what the Government are seeking to impose on a public transport structure, both publicly and privately owned, which basically is not run on a purely profit-making, entrepreneurial basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members have pointed out on numerous occasions that cross-subsidisation within the bus industry was not especially significant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They have also pointed out the importance of the subsidies from the Government and local government, through the county authorities, thereby drawing attention to the basic problem that practically the whole of the public passenger road transport system in Britain receives, in one way or another, substantial subsidies. Because of that, it operates under all sorts of statutory and extra-statutory controls imposed by those who hold the purse-strings, namely central Government and he counties which supply the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, if we are to have a sensible fares system, it is vital that the new licences should be issued only if the traffic commissioners have taken account of the financial and other circumstances which prevail in regard to most of the major operators. By "major operators" I mean those in the private and public sectors. Because if the Government wish to go over to a system whereby fares are all,
	<span class='label label-info column'>792</span>
and the economic fare, or the fare which will make the operator a decent, profitable return on every journey, route or group of routes is charged everywhere, without any subventions from central or local government, they will have to introduce a much more wide-ranging measure than this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If they do not do so, it would be foolish in the extreme to allow clause 7 to go through unamended. If it does we will have an approach to fares which is not fish, flesh or fowl. Getting out those three words at this time of the morning is quite an achievement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Basically the four types of organisations mentioned in the amendment, the passenger transport authorities and executives, have duties and obligations imposed on them by the Transport Act 1978 which are not purely financial and commercial. Similarly, the non-metropolitan councils have obligations placed on them to do all sorts of things by way of planning and preparing plans and policies for passenger transport provision and by helping to provide the money that subsidises the services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regional and island councils, about which I know nothing, are, I presume, under similar obligations, as my hon. Friend has included them in the amendment. Certainly the National Bus Company and the Scottish Transport Group are under other non-commercial obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said at an earlier sitting that it was a pity that many of these bodies had a legal obligation to produce all those plans and policies, and he said that they were a waste of time. If he thinks that, he will in order to get a cohesive and coherent approach to fares, have to make all sorts of changes to all sorts of public transport legislation. He cannot just do it by the hotchpotch clause 7. It would be foolish to try to superimpose the obligations of the clause on those bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend and my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) have drawn attention to a number of points that the traffic commissioners ought to bear in mind, namely, their attitude to fares and their willingness to accept that an approach to fares by an operator is not damaging to existing services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is a further aspect to which I wish to draw attention. As the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Mr. Bevan) has pointed out, there has been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0436">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>793</span>
significant public investment, which the people of Birmingham and the West Midlands wanted, in new railway stations and in new links between railways and buses in the area. Somebody had to pay for that provision and it is right and proper that, in deciding about fares in those areas, the traffic commissioners should bear in mind the financial obligations of the bodies who made that public investment to the benefit of the public in that area, the impact of those obligations and that investment and the rate of return that the councils concerned have expected from that investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right and proper that the traffic commissioner should bear that aspect in mind when deciding what fares could be introduced by an operator working in competition with all the existing operators in the area, and in particular those providing a better service because of the substantial public investment that may have taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be crazy if the people of Birmingham and the West Midlands, for example, having decided that these services and improvements to services were to be brought about, were to see the whole financial planning benefiting an operator. I assume that in the various roles he had as chairman of the passenger transport authority and as chairman of the transport committee, the hon. Member for Yardley made sure authorities made proper calculations of their outgoings and what their income was likely to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If they went into those matters carefully and made proper, reasonable and prudent predictions, and prudent provisions in the fare structure that they established in the light of all they had spent, it would be absurd to allow an operator to come whizzing in on top of that and make use of those publicly provided facilities. That operator would be bearing none of the costs of the investment which made some of the facilities possible. It would be absurd to allow him to charge lower fares and thus severely damage the operating profit and loss account of the authorities in the Birmingham and West Midlands. I am sure that that must apply in other areas, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will know, Mr. English, that I do not go along with the principles behind the Bill, but even accepting those principles and their efforts to introduce an element of competition, I cannot believe that if the Conservatives are devoted as a party and
	<span class='label label-info column'>794</span>
as a Government to reducing public expenditure they really want to put certain authorities that made prudent and rational decisions a few years ago into the position where their prudence and rationality is kicked apart by undercharging on the part of new competitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all those reasons, and a host more that I could go into if I wanted to protract further our deliberations, I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment. It seeks to protect, within reason, the existing provision of public passenger transport services on Britain's roads. It will not feather-bed the present services, but will simply make sure that they are not undermined. It will ensure that the public sector is not forced to whack in amazing amounts of subsidy to make up for income that various operators reasonably assumed would be coming their way following their investment both in fixed assets and in moving assets—let alone recruitment policies and other such considerations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>2.15 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate, which has been interesting, has shown that in many ways the new power that we are proposing—entirely a reserve power—is just what Labour Members would like. It takes fares questions that are the responsibility and interest of local authorities out of the control of the traffic commissioners. The arguments put before me are those with which Labour Members have much sympathy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I remind the Committee of the present position? At present the traffic commissioners fix all fares in detail. A lot of time and effort is involved in making applications for fare increases and in defending them at public sittings. The arguments at public sittings are often really about the revenue support policy of the local authority and not about anything remotely within the jurisdiction of the traffic commissioners. It is certainly true that the Bill changes all that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The traffic commissioners will retain a reserve power to control fares, but they will use it only where it is necessary to prevent exploitation of the licence privileges or destructive undercutting. We retain the reserve power only as a 
	<i>quid pro quo</i> for having a licensing system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can go into the matter in more detail on clause stand part. It would probably be your wish, Mr. English, that we should discuss the more general aspects of policy
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0437">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>795</span>
then. But our system would certainly avoid the sort of situation that concerns not only Labour Members, but my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Mr. Bevan). That is when the elected local authority exercising its judgment can have its policies held up by the exercise of power by the traffic commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the amendment. Clearly it is right that when the traffic commissioners decide whether to attach conditions relating to fares they should take into account the statutory duties of passenger transport authorities, passenger transport executives, shire county councils, Scottish regional and islands councils, the National Bus Company and the Scottish Transport Group. I am sure that the commissioners will look at those duties, but I am also sure that they will be cautious about putting fares conditions on operators acting directly in accordance with decisions of elected councils, or where fares have been agreed with them in the course of revenue support negotiations. They will not be easily swayed by pressure groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essence of the fares system that we are putting forward is that there is a lack of interference except in specified circumstances where it is essential in the public interest. It is not a general power of interference, but a reserve power that is being retained for the traffic commissioners to intervene in limited circumstances. That position fully meets the fears of the local authorities and the public operators that they may be restricted in a way that conflicts with their other obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see why those fears have been expressed. We have sought to meet their concern that their decisions, the decisions of elected councils, are being interfered with and elected members take second place to the powers of the traffic commissioners. We accept that argument. However, we consider that the fears of the public authorities and public operators are not justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the arguments adduced during the debate I should have thought that the reserve power in the Bill is exactly the power that hon. Members would wish to see.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point made by the Minister was that in this clause the Government envisage fare controls being used in only exceptional circumstances. Therefore it is up to those people being consulted about fares policy to justify,
	<span class='label label-info column'>796</span>
in the public interest, a fares control or attachment being applied to a licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not pursue the difference of interpretation of "public interest" but the amendment highlights the obligations based on passenger transport authorities, metropolitan county councils, regional and island councils and the National Bus Company. The Minister may say that they are the elected authorities and they have some say about fares. Indeed, as the transport authorities operate, they make recommendations, but the commissioner does not necessarily accept their argument for a particular fare increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can think of a number of cases where the commissioners have granted only half of what has been requested by a particular authority. At a meeting last week, the West Yorkshire passenger transport authority applied for a fares increase. The difficulty arises when one considers that a commissioner may have to take into account when dealing with, for example, a National Bus Company application for a fares increase on a route shared with another bus operator whose attitude on the normal costs may differ—a relevant point to be considered regarding fares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is assumed that the commissioner, in granting a fares increase, would not wish to authorise an increase that did not reflect the increase in costs, although bus undertakings would put forward other factors in justification of a fares increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a dilemma where there are two authorities with different obligations. In my own area the bus authority makes an application for a fares increase on a route run by the local authority, when as tradition has it, a National Bus Company bus has operated on the same route within the city of Hull. The argument has continued for a number of years as to the different conditions that apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the National Bus Company say that its price structure is higher than that of the local authority because it is obliged to face the financial obligations imposed on a nationalised industry. Therefore its fares increase request is considerably higher than that requested by the local authority. To compound the difficulty, it is accepted by all hon. Members that an increase of fares inevitably leads to fewer passengers. The fares are therefore important in determining the size of the transport system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the passenger transport
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0438">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>797</span>
authorities that are evident in our amendment. When one compares the pricing or fares policy which has been allowed to develop, one will notice that five out of the seven have pursued a reasonably high fares policy, which has had the consequential effect of reducing passengers, where as two—to be specific, South Yorkshire and Tyneside—have operated a low fares policy and have had an increase in passengers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make that point only because it relates to a decision in regard to fares policy, and the fact that the elected representatives, to whom the Minister referred, may for a number of reasons make a judgment in relation to other similar bus operators. Those are matters which may emerge later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder, however, how the Commissioner will operate his reserve powers in order to deal with the conflict between the different obligations that Parliament has placed upon different transport operators. Will the Commissioner take into account the obligations of National Bus, which are quite clear and have been read out in the Committee—obligations such as the need to balance its revenue, to take into account a number of matters and to involve the principle of cross-subsidisation? We have just had a debate on that matter, and I do not intend to repeat it. But clearly, those obligations will inevitably mean a higher cost structure. How will the Commissioner, under the Government's own proposals, use these reserve powers in order to determine the criteria that he will use for a minimum and maximum fare?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: He will not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that he will not, but as I understand it he has the power to fix a minimum or a maximum fare as defined in this clause. I am advised that a maximum fare will be fair for the passenger and for the operator who is exploiting the situation and making far too much profit, whereas the minimum fare will presumably be determined in cases where competition is too great and cutting everybody's throat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the sole criterion which is to operate, it is a totally unsatisfactory situation. How will the Commissioner determine a minimum and a maximum fare, as he can under this clause, when there are different obligations for different undertakings? It will clearly be right for National Bus to argue that it has a statutory
	<span class='label label-info column'>798</span>
obligation and that it cannot maintain a bus on a certain route and face its obligation, which is very specific. I am not necessarily talking about the obligation that is put on the local authorities, the passenger transport authorities or the county councils—that has a much broader remit and is referred to in the Bill—but rather the statutory financial obligation which Commissioners up to now have recognised in granting price increases. Will they still be able to refer to that? If so, the difficulty may arise that the higher cost structure embodied in the National Bus application may be higher than that which may well be requested as a reasonable fare policy for a private operator. That already happens under the present system. I presume that fair competition will be allowed to take the place and that National Bus will simply have to charge the lowest fare that exists and face the consequences of that action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is so, and I see some hon. Members nodding in agreement, it fills me with alarm. If they wanted to, the Government could at least relieve the National Bus Company of its obligations, because if they believe in competition, they must recognise that National Bus can in no way hope to compete fairly with any other operator on a similar route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that case one can say that one is sorry but that competition will prevail, and I presume the idea is that it should be fair. Alternatively, our amendment specifically allows the Commissioner to say that the obligations which Parliament has imposed upon these industries will be taken into account when he determines fare policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment, thus leaving the clause as it is—which will not allow for this anomaly—he should at least give those industries a fair chance and indicate whether he will relieve them of the obligations that we in Parliament have imposed on them under the different conditions and principles relating to previous transport legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>2.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have a distinct problem here, a very deep problem, because on the one hand the Government are talking about free competition, but on the other hand, unless they are prepared to accept this amendment, they are talking utter rubbish. Basically, the am-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0439">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>799</span>
endment seeks to take account of obligations which are put on local authorities to provide a service. In the context of fares, nothing in the Bill takes account of that matter. The Government have said up to now that people will be allowed to go for lucrative areas, but that takes no account of the obligation placed by successive Governments on local authorities to provide a service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
2.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Something interesting has just come to hand. I am advised by a very reliable authority, which says that because fares are an essential element in regulating the terms of competition on a route, the commissioners are placed under a duty to remove all fare conditions when requested to do so by the licence holder. Yet if this amendment is not carried, the unfair competition becomes very relevant because successive Governments have placed an obligation on local authorities to provide a service, and yet, lo and behold, given that obligation, we now understand, by authority that has descended from on high, that the commissioners have a duty to remove all fare conditions when requested to do so by a licence holder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not apply to local authorities which, under the Acts, have an obligation, regardless of fair competition and any other criteria. Unless this amendment is carried, fair competition goes out of the window, because the commissioner does not have the power to talk about fares in this context since the local authority has an obligation to take on these services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, from the papers by which I am advised, this is the crucial difference between them:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 7 is designed"</p></blockquote>
—this is crucial—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to make fares control an unusual, not a normal event."</p></blockquote>
In reference to the amendment, we are saying that fares and the control of them ought to be an unusual event, yet if the amendment is not carried we have the aspect of unfair competition, because placed on local authorities is an obligation to provide a service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be very interested if the Minister could tell me how he makes the fair competition argument, yet does
	<span class='label label-info column'>800</span>
not implement in the Bill the obligation on a local authority to provide a service, whether or not it be profit making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause is a revelation. It is
	<br><blockquote><p>"designed to make fares control an unusual"—</p></blockquote>
and then we go, Mr. English, just a little broader than the amendment to talk about public interest. The Government have the sheer audacity to talk about the public interest when they say that the Bill will revolutionise transport and will suddenly make fares control an unusual and not a normal practice. That might be fair enough, but basically, I disagree with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to clarify the situation, because it says that the traffic commissioners will take account of this matter in fixing fares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us highlight the case. On the one hand, a local authority has an obligation to provide a service from A to B, yet, on the other hand, with the wide aspect of this free enterprise Bill, under which competition is to be magnificent, there could be a situation in which although the local authority is obliged to provide a service, the sharks then move in under the terms of the Bill. Do we say to the local authority "Thou shalt not now provide this service, because the sharks have moved in. Thou shalt have free commission?" We do not say that, because under various Acts local authorities are still obliged to provide the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can the Government say, in all sincerity, "Free competition", when they still impose on the traffic commissioners, without putting it into the Bill, a duty to take cognisance of the fact and when the sharks can move in? It would be very interesting if the Minister were to stand up to defend the free enterprise system. I am sure that the public would be very interested indeed to find, without this amendment, that clause 7 is designed to make fares control an unusual and not a normal event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been stated in regard to previous parts of the Bill that the Government are making a great impact on public interest and the defence of it. How can one ignore an amendment which places a restriction on providing a service and, at the same time, says that everyone has to move in, but not take cognisance of successive Governments who might place a restriction on this? The Government defend free competition but they are imposing on local
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0440">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>801</span>
authorities a restriction by not accepting an amendment to the Bill. Their position is untenable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Member for Newcasie upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) is having difficulty with the amendment after my right hon. Friend explained the position. I am not quite able to understand his fears nor those of his right hon. and hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the way in which those on the Opposition side, who are perhaps those who are less concerned with transport, feel that the specialists we have here often represent fares control essentially as a protection for the public against the rapidly escalating level of bus fares, it is interesting that hon. Members have clearly come to grips much more with the difficulties of providing a passenger transport service on the roads in the present economic circumstances and are more concerned with the dangers of undercutting fares and fares being reduced on particular services, unless there is fares control, and with delays in putting up fares where necessary, for the NBC and others to reach their targets. The way in which my right hon. Friend explained the limited circumstances in which fares control of any kind would be provided, once clause 7 was enacted, should have set most of those fears at rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point on these amendments is that the fact that the Bill does not make specific reference to the various statutory duties of the authorities that are referred to in the amendments does not mean that the commissioners will not have regard to them or will ignore them or take decisions that cut across those duties in the way in which the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central indicated. Clearly, awareness of those duties and any submissions made to them by various authorities mentioned in pursuance of those duties will be matters that are relevant for the traffic commissioners to consider when deciding whether to impose any fares control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I illustrate the matter finally in this way—which may help us in all our considerations of clause 7. We have made it clear that this is a reserve power. I suggest to the Committee that the things to keep one's eyes on in considering the nature of this reserve power are the two situations within which that reserve power is to be exercised. In subsection (3), paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>) and (
	<i>b</i>) are the relevant paragraphs. They set out
	<span class='label label-info column'>802</span>
the only occasions the Bill provides on which the traffic commissioners may find it necessary to impose fares control. I paraphrase paragraph (
	<i>a</i>) as exploitation of a monopoly position where there is a licensed service with no competition, through which the public is being exploited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is inconceivable that if a local authority, in pursuance of its statutory duty to provide a proper service, were to support a bus operator in the fares that he wished to impose or was imposing, any fares charged which had the support of a local authority would be regarded as exploitation or as unreasonable by the traffic commissioners and would give rise to fares control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3)(
	<i>b</i>) states
	<br><blockquote><p>"to regulate the terms of competition between stage carriage services"</p></blockquote>
—what one might refer to as destructive undercutting, which has a wider effect on the network or on the services. As long as the local authorities mentioned in these amendments take the view that there is a case for regulating fares conditions on routes or particular sections of routes in the interest of the community, it is bound to be regarded by the commissioners as probably the most relevant representation that can be made to them in deciding whether it is a case where it is essential in the public interest to regulate competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe there is any conflict between the Bill as it stands and the aims of the Opposition. On the other hand, I do not think for one moment that it is necessary to restate the aims. There is a danger that if we start to make the clause over-elaborate, as has been the temptation in previous clauses, along the road of putting in lists of various bodies which have to be consulted and considerations that have to be taken into account, we shall start to wander back into encouraging some commissioners to regard fares control as the norm or to encourage delays in changes and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his usual lucid way, the Parliamentary Secretary referred to subsection (3)(
	<i>b</i>) as avoiding what he described as destructive undercutting. The problem is basically, as I understand it—I hope he will correct me if I am wrong—that when referring to destructive undercutting, he is referring to destructive undercutting in relation to a particular route at a particular
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0441">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>803</span>
time. My concern and that of other Labour Members on the Committee is also with destructive undercutting, which may apply in a sense to the generality of what has been done in Birmingham or the West Midlands as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Birmingham PTE or West Midlands PTE has started to provide a service and has built a bus station, bearing the costs of the bus station as well as those of the buses and the guys who are employed, there is a possibility that in the provision of a service where the fares are not comparable with those provided by the existing public transport authority, there will be destructive undercutting. That is so because ultimately it will destroy the general provision in the area. The ratepayers or the Government will have to start putting in more money to make up for the losses which the public undertaking has incurred as a result of the incursions into its profits of someone else who is not bearing the costs of all the public investment which has been put in, at a time when it was quite rational for the authority in the West Midlands—under the excellent chairmanship, no doubt, of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Mr. Bevan)—to make that sort of investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is this destructive undercutting in general that might arise that I and other Opposition Members are bothered about. From what the Parliamentary Secretary has said—he is usually easy to follow—he was referring not to that general undercutting, but simply to a small short-term affair on one or two particular routes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I undoubtedly was, and I shall not stray into what would, perhaps, become a clause stand part debate if we started to talk at any length about what I mean by destructive undercutting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Destructive of what? What I mean by "destructive undercutting" is something that does damage to the general provision of passenger transport. I shall give examples—perhaps in the clause stand part debate—but what I am contemplating in this respect is routes or small parts of routes. The fact that it is actually destructive of the financial position of an operator, because he finds that he is facing competition from a lower-cost provider of transport on some of his routes, would not in itself be a reason for fares control. There will be some less-efficient municipal author-
	<span class='label label-info column'>804</span>
ities. I am sure that these do not include the West Midlands council, which, as I know from the comparatively low rate of grant and revenue support that that council looks for, appears from its financial reports to be a great deal more efficient than some of the others. But there will be some inefficient municipal operators which will find that other people are able to provide services with—to use the phrase used by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott)—a lower cost structure, for one reason or another, and the municipal operators will start losing services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remedy is not for a local authority to go along to the traffic commissioners saying "Look, Barsetshire's buses cannot compete with these people, who seem to run more efficiently and generally to have lower costs than ourselves." The answer is either to get their own costs down, or to move out and save the public investment in this field by allowing a lower cost operator to provide and operate a service at the cheaper fares. The fact that a competitor was finding the competition hard to bear would not be a reason for the commissioners to exercise control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A correct exercise of the function would be where the undercutting is of a selective nature and is so affecting a profitable route or part of a route upon which other services are dependent that it is plain that the general provision of public transport in the area will be diminished if this destructive undercutting—I use that phrase now; I must find another for the next amendment—is allowed on a section of the route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a reserve and rare power. One of the things that would help the traffic commissioners to determine when to use the power would be any submissions from the local authority on preserving the network in the particular area. That no doubt would help to support a particular instance where the power might be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary seems to have missed the point completely. We are saying that without any shadow of doubt, there are statutory rights for a local authority to provide a service, and that the traffic commissioner should take cognisance of that fact. The Minister is saying that the local authority has a certain right to opt out. We are not talking about that. Under successive Acts
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0442">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>805</span>
a local authority has had a statutory right to provide services. Under those conditions, where the local authority has a duty to provide a service, how can one do that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of any local authority that is operating under a statutory duty whereby it has to provide a No. 68 bus from the city centre to some outlying council's area. If somebody comes along and can provide some equivalent to the No. 68 bus from the centre to the outlying area, with no damage to passenger needs or to the service, and he happens to provide it at less cost, the answer is for the council to get its costs down or get out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not a case for fares control, and it is not an area in which one would expect fares control to be used in future. I do not believe that duties of that kind are imposed on statutory authorities. There is a duty for them to consider the transport needs of their areas. Those are exactly what the commissioners would have to consider, and we do not believe it necessary to write into the Bill the express obligation to take account of what will be, in all cases, their relevant submissions. I therefore invite the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the Parliamentary Secretary was not in the Committee at the start of the debate. Had he been here, he would have heard me say that what the local authorities are required to do by the statutes outlined in the amendment is not only to have some regard to, or to survey, the transport needs of their areas, but to take positive steps to promote the development of good passenger transport services, to co-ordinate and to plan. These are the sort of terms which are embraced in the list of statutory provisions named in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned about the way in which the commissioners' exercise of their powers to attach to those service licences conditions as to fares impinges upon the statutory duties of local authorities. That is at the heart of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had the advantage of having both the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary reply to us, and we have had rather different replies. I shall try to deal with both. First, the Minister said that he took the remarks of my hon. Friends and myself to imply that we favoured this sort
	<span class='label label-info column'>806</span>
of change in the traffic commissioners' role. That is to say, he assumed that because we had put down the amendment, and because of what we had said in support of our amendment, we thought it right to reduce the power of the commissioners to attach conditions as to fares and control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see how the Minister can make that assumption. The amendment is neutral on that point. It would be equally valid if the commissioners had powers under the clause totally to control fares. In fact, it might be even more valid as an amendment if that were so, but that is not the case. The case as to the clause is accepting, for the purpose of the amendment, that the powers of the commissioners that we are talking about are these specific powers. We accept that they are given those powers under existing law, and that they are limited in a specific way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see, therefore, how the amendment is held by the Minister to be anything to do with the way in which pressure groups might try to influence the commissioners. These were the terms the Minister used. We are not saying that the commissioners should or should not be influenced by pressure groups. We are saying that if they are to exercise these exceptional or special powers as defined, they should be required to have regard to the requirements of the local authority—not that they have chosen them necessarily, but those that may have been imposed upon them by Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the commissioners start altering fares structures, even under the special provisions in the Bill, they will impinge upon the ability of the local authorities to carry out these duties. These duties are clearly affected by the total financial arrangement made in the area for the provision of passenger transport services. They are affected by how much is taken in fares or how much cannot be taken in fares with the change. They are affected by arrangements made by the Minister in supplying transport grant and in approving the plans of the local authority for passenger transport quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has been said up to now goes nowhere towards meeting our fears. In some ways my worries were increased when the Minister suggested that we should not be concerned about historic rights or obligations. We are not talking about historic rights or obligations. We are talking about current obligations, which are of extreme relevance. Nothing is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0443">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>807</span>
happening in transport which leads us to believe that those duties imposed upon the local authorities have faded into insignificance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Transport authorities, as the Minister well knows, are having considerable difficulties in their efforts to fulfil the task which Parliament has properly set them. Parliament is absolutely right to suggest that the local authorities should have specific responsibilities, because only they can know the implications of various changes in their areas for services for the people who put them in that position of responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless a requirement is written into the clause that the commissioner has regard to these things, we could be in considerable difficulty. It does not change the circumstances in which the power is exercised, which is implicit in what the Parliamentary Secretary says. But I do not think it would necessarily vary with any submissions made by the local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably we should wish, as elected parliamentarians, always to encourage the local authorities to comply completely in spirit and intention with legislation carried through here. The spirit and intention of this legislation is absolutely clear, and it is therefore necessary for the Minister to tell us how he thinks that the traffic commissioners can reasonably be expected to have regard to these specific requirements if they are not written into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We appreciate that the traffic commissioner is working under difficulties. Pressures are being borne in upon him, some arising directly from this legislation. He is being told that he must operate in a different way and that, if the Bill is enacted, he cannot exercise his powers under subsection (1) unless he is convinced that it is essential in the public interest as narrowly defined here. That is a very different position. Therefore, given that he is placed under these tighter constrictions, it is even more difficult for him to assume that Parliament intended him to do what is defined in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose the mirror image of the argument is that, if Parliament objects to the amendment, the commissioners might be entitled to draw the conclusion that we do not want them to take into account all the statutory obligations that Parliament has put on local authorities. That would be disastrous to the proper aims of local authorities trying to carry out a duty. We
	<span class='label label-info column'>808</span>
have not had an answer on this fundamental point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend is making a valid point. On the one hand, Parliament passes legislation. Presumably that means that it must be implemented. Yet the Government refuse to use successive Acts clearly to define to the traffic commissioner that, in the context of the Bill, Acts of Parliament exist of which he must take cognisance. Surely that is the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He reminds me, very properly, of the specific relationship of the legislation referred to in the Bill. If Parliament says to a commissioner, "You must judge this on your best interpretation of the public interest", he might take the view that the public interest is best judged by looking at what Parliament has said over the last 20, 30, 40, or 50 years. He might take the view that the public interest is best defined by what the local authority has decided under its transport planning obligations. If so, different conclusions would be reached in different areas. A traffic commissioner in South Yorkshire would reach a different conclusion from that of a traffic commissioner in Oxfordshire. The traffic commissioners can be in a difficulty unless we are specific. We can be specific and our guidance must be the legislation referred to here. The Bill does not propose the amendment of any of those measures. It is clearly intended that the legislation should stand and that these duties should still be imposed upon local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
3 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with that contention of the Minister. He is right not to include in the Bill any amendment to any of these pieces of legislation. They are crucially important to the wider aims of the Bill, which we are not really developing here. But they are of more specific application to that part of the Bill which we are considering—the way in which commissioners will exercise special powers if they alter fare structures. Of course it could apply to the whole of a network arrangement or to a single service. But it is almost certain that if this power is used as selectively as the Minister indicates that he wishes it should, it could impinge on areas in which there are total network agreements as to financing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0444">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>809</span>
which have depended on fare structures having been established at any time within the last 12 months, and which could change under this provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not had an answer on this central point. I hope that one will be forthcoming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. The promotional fare provision presumably would not be permanent. May I correct myself in that case? It is the revised fare on the service introduced which can only be charged until the commissioner has decided. I would suggest that the promotional fare would be covered by the revised fare. We can go into this matter rather more carefully after I have deployed what I believe is to be the central issue attaching to this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the right hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) intervened, I was about to say that I was conscious that we are to debate with this amendment No. 116, which may have a very similar purpose and which is different only to the extent which the variation of the fare is concerned. So, in saying what I think would be the useful purpose of the merit, I am not suggesting that they are the only ones by any means and that a number of other arguments can be adduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also conscious that this could cut
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0445">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>811</span>
across certain of the considerations which would have applied had the Government accepted the last set of amendments. Had they done so, I may well have withdrawn this amendment with the agreement of my hon. Friends, leaving the argument to come entirely on amendment No. 116. Since the previous amendments have been defeated, we are left with the clause in this very special form, where it is quite certain that the intention of the clause is to have a narrow specific condition in which the commissioners may step in to vary the fare conditions attached to the licence. I think we could fairly consider how far it is necessary, in the circumstances of the clause, to seek to avoid operators suffering delays in the granting of their fare revision applications, particularly when their fares are subject to conditions attached to the licences under the provisions of this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
3.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is little doubt that some operators suffer from such delays. Those delays undermine part of the basis of the viability of the operator for that period, or have the alternative effect of causing the operator to put in an earlier application in anticipation of a change of conditions. Either of those reactions on the part of the operator is undesirable. From the public point of view, the operator should be confident and clear about his grounds for his application for variation. He should not be anticipating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that there is a clear-cut notice to an operator in some circumstances that an increase in his costs is imminent. It might be that a wage increase has been negotiated by one of the unions to take effect one or more months hence. It might be that he has been notified by the suppliers of his fuel that a fuel increase is forthcoming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, of course, he can make the application in advance and defend it. But there are many other circumstances, particularly with the present rate of inflation, when the operator cannot foresee how his rate of costs will vary. I suggest that he is not entitled to assume that, since we have an inflation rate of 16 per cent. or even 18 per cent., his costs will rise by that amount within the period in which his application might be considered. Clearly, the factors which contribute to the general inflation increase
	<span class='label label-info column'>812</span>
will not necessarily all bear upon the operator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think there is, therefore, a case to be considered for allowing some ability to raise fares immediately, within very narrowly prescribed limits—one can argue as to whether the limit prescribed in this amendment is right or not. I do not think the case rests on the figure. This should be on a temporary basis and without prejudice to the final determination of the commissioners. On these conditions I think there is a case to be considered as to whether having such flexibility as this amendment would provide might make for a more suitable operational arrangement for the financing of the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that there is a balance of argument involved in this. The argument as to the amendment does not arise from this side of the Committee in the circumstances of the existing legislation. It arises in the context of this Bill, where the role of the commissioner in determining fares is much narrower. It is the intention of the Bill as the Minister has indicated on earlier amendments, that there would be a range of services operating to which the conditions were not attached. Certainly in those cases greater flexibility would exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is arguable that there is a certain inequity between those operating outwith fares conditions and those operating within fares conditions which might be reduced, not removed, by the passing of this amendment. I want to put to the Committee that even if this amendment only enables the operators to counter the financial effects of delay on processing their applications it might be useful. Given that it allows for movements up and down, it may be attractive in allowing operators to respond to the greater scope for competitive conditions which the Minister hopes will arise from his Bill and which I suspect will arise in only a limited number of routes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the Minister's desire for greater competitiveness and the desire on this side of the Committee, faced with what we take to be an implacable opposition to putting into this Bill the wider conditions of fare control which are in existing legislation, I think that this is a move towards a greater equity between one group of operators and another and has certain merits from the point of view of conducting operations within the framework of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0446">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>813</span>
That framework on the one hand makes the distinction between operators, and, on the other, will require them in many instances to face difficult changes of financial arrangements. These can be very difficult choices. An operator might have to choose between a temporary loss, in order to hold a route against competitors, and moving in the other direction to cover cost increases he knows are coming. If he is already operating on a profitable route, faced with competition, he may wish to make a commercial decision. This argument will appeal to hon. Gentlemen opposite more than to my hon. Friends. It is a valid argument in the context of the amendment and the way in which the clause is framed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For these reasons I put this amendment to the Committee and I shall be interested to hear the argument advanced for the amendment chosen with it—I am particularly interested to hear from the Minister how he would reconcile the inability of the operator who has the condition attached to his licence to respond with the other operator who has no condition attached and with whom he may be competing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing in this clause to guarantee that a condition attached to one licence on the route will also attach to other licences operating over that same route, even if they operate at different distances. Therefore the clause allows of the possibility of difficulties of competition which I hope that the Government will wish to eliminate in order to bear some consistency of application with the principles they advocate on the desirability of competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These matters warrant very careful consideration of whether there should be some expansion of the conditions attached to allow this limited variation of fares within those very specific limits which I have prescribed. These are limits of time and variation, and they would, of course, not prejudice an ultimate decision by the commissioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mills</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always, Mr. English, you are an expert in these matters. My comments were that out of six names I thought perhaps one or two are quite exceptionally to be agreed to. We have here two out of three, but perhaps I might give some comments on suggesting some of the points which motivated us to put down amendment No. 116. We believe that it is important to probe the Government's attitude towards this matter, hence this probing amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to establish a number of points. I believe that we have reached in the Committee a threshold of acceptance of detailed words and arguments posed by hon. Members on both sides. It seems to me that it would be quite superfluous to continue with some of the detailed, and now almost boring, arguments. We have heard them in different forms rehashed so many times, I am sure hon. Members will forgive me if I summarise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We ask the Government to clarify this point in two respects which are very important. One is the possible delays that could occur due to, for example, increased costs. Secondly, there is the likely reaction under the increased freedom given by other clauses to operators to react in a promotional sense. We are not suggesting that there should be allowance for that, but an allowance of up to 10 per cent. for increases in fares to do it. It is a modest and reasonable probing amendment. I say "probing" because I think that it is probably impractical in the terms of the amendment—as in the case of the Opposition amendment—to achieve any practicality of control or freedom of flexibility within the Bill. I hope that my example of brevity will be followed by Labour Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How could one see an amendment actually give more flexibility for allowance for increased costs, say, or for exceptional circumstances, to operators and for the extra competition that we hope will ensue? It is rather strange to see amendment No.

116, which seems to be almost identical with that put forward in communications sent to us all from the National Bus Company, which is no doubt worried about how it will compete. Indeed, one hopes that it does worry about competing, because it needs to compete—certainly in my rural areas in north Warwickshire—in getting prices down and services better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no idea how my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary will respond to amendment Nos. 102 or 116, but I hope that he will say that they are unnecessary. I am encouraged to believe that that would be his response because of his response to an earlier amendment. I was very interested to hear his explanation and that of my right hon. Friend of clause 7 and the explanation basically that the powers of the commissioners with regard to fares will be reserve powers. That would mean, I presume, that the occasions on which the commissioners would be determining fares would be the exception rather that is the case, I am very glad indeed. My experience of traffic commissioners is limited. I have had the doubtful pleasure of attending one or two hearings, and I was appalled at the bureaucratic nightmare and the cost that was involved in the traffic commissioners hearing cases of fare increases. I remember one case where the fare increases being applied for by the bus company was 10 per cent., which was roughly the current level of inflation at that time. For two days there were 60 or 70 people in the hall, and counsel were engaged by a number of parties protesting against that 10 per cent. fare increase, which was basically all that was needed by the bus company to match the level of inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole thing was something of a nonsense. I shall be very pleased if the result of this Bill is that in future the bus companies, the operators, will be able to increase prices as and when necessary without having to go through a nightmare procedure. I am sure that there will be many arguments that there needs to be some public accountability and the like, but the fact is—and I hope there will be broad agreement on this—that the old procedures had got totally out of hand and were totally irrelevant to the needs of the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that this reserve power approach is right. The very fact that it is a reserve
	<span class='label label-info column'>816</span>
power and will not be utilised very often will mean, presumably, that private operators and the National Bus Company will be free generally to put up their prices by the 10 per cent. or the 15 per cent. proposed in the amendment moved by the right hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter to be decided either by this Committee or by the commissioners, as I understand it. It is only if the operators exploit their position unreasonably, if they exploit a monopoly position in the circumstances described in the clause. Presumably, if they put them up by 15 per cent. every month, the traffic commissioners will then be able to invoke these powers and apply conditions to the licence. But, generally speaking, as I have understood what I have heard so far, the question of level of fares, whether charged by private operators or by the National Bus Company or by municipal authorities, would be decided by the operators themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills</div> <!-- member -->

We did so, and I think it reveals no secret to the Opposition, in order that we might actually get rid of the whole nonsense. I quite accept that nonsense it is at the moment in the vast majority of cases. But it is essential to our approach to all the amendments to begin from the basis that what we envisage is that conditions as to fares will only be attached in the minority of cases, that it will by no means be the norm for such conditions to be attached. I should expect that, over most of the country, such circumstances would be few and far between—where it was thought that any real public interest was served by attaching fares conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These amendments are therefore concerned with how flexible the arrangements will be when fares conditions have to be attached and with whether the operators will continue to suffer frustrating delays when they need to raise their fares unless amendments of this kind are made. I hope to satisfy the Committee that, in the limited circumstances in which we are envisaging fares control, the present problems of delays should not arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quite accept that there is a real problem with delays. I have had discussions about this with the National Bus Company, which is very concerned in many cases Many local authorities are very concerned about the effect on their transport undertakings. They have responsibilities when delays are caused in seeking fares increases. Private operators are just as concerned. Barton's Transport, which operates in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, including my constituency, has had what it regards as serious delays in getting fares increases after wage settlements, and such delays impose a great burden on the undertaking. It will get the increases but there are delays in granting them. The strength of the industry is damaged when needless delays take place because of the procedures, after costs have increased because of fuel costs, wage settlements and the inevitable inflationary problems that transport undertakings are experiencing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the generality of cases there need be no fears because there will not be fares
	<span class='label label-info column'>818</span>
control. One needs to look once more at subsection (3)(
	<i>a</i>) and (
	<i>b</i>) to consider the particular circumstances in which fares control will still apply, to relate the problem of delay to that, and to decide whether a percentage flexibility is really required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection 3(b) I describe as the monopolist abusing his position, where a road service licence has given an operator a complete monopoly and it is plain that, because of some happy chance, that operator, be he private or public—I do not go along with the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans), who describes any private operator as a shark—is making a considerable profit out of it. Subsection 3(a) is therefore applied to the situation in which the traffic commissioners are satisfied that someone is abusing his position, has a licensed monopoly and is grossly overcharging, and it is right to apply fares conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, which would be very limited in the present state of the bus industry, it would be inappropriate if the traffic commissioners decided that someone was so misbehaving that fares control was needed to give a 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. flexibility to keep putting the fares up without having to go back to the commissioners. That is, as it were, the monopolist abusing his power, who needs to be put under tighter restraint, and to whom it would not be reasonable to give the flexibility which is sought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3)(b) is the more important part. It mirrors the situation which troubles many operators—in which, in order to protect a particular little group of services, it is necessary to regulate the terms of competition on a route or part of a route. That would normally be done by imposing minimum fares. Hon. Members will appreciate that the problem in subsection (3)(b) type of situation is making sure that fares are held at such a level as to generate the necessary revenue to support whatever bit of service that that is supporting. What one is trying to prevent is destructive undercutting. Therefore, the Government expect that the commissioners will use the power that they are to be given under subsection (1) to impose minimum fares. If minimum fares have been imposed on a route in order to regulate the terms of competition between stage carriage services, that means that there is no traffic commissioners' prohibition on increasing the fares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, if a regulated route is subject
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0449">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>819</span>
to a minimum fare, one does not need 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. flexibility. If there is a sudden increase in costs for all the operators, there is nothing to prevent them from moving straight away to reflect those costs in their fares. It is therefore of no advantage to give any one of the operators a flexibility which they all actually have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the restricted circumstances in which fares control is contemplated in the Bill, it is inappropriate to put in the flexibility proposed in the amendments. I hope that I have made it clear. If there were any chance of the present system of farescontrol continuing, arguments put forward by bus operators, district councils, county councils and so on, would be unanswerable. It would be a less modest step if we were not to go to clause 7 but to keep the present system and then have 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. as is proposed. The present system is a nonsense and certainly needs improving. I think we have gone further in clause 7 and in the restrictive circumstances of fares' control here provided. The amendments are superfluous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to avoid getting on to a "clause stand part" debate. I shall attempt to avoid it, though some of the arguments mounted by Conservative Members seem to be related to that debate rather than to the two amendments we are considering. Nevertheless, it seems likely that times will occur when operators will wish to introduce fare increases to tide them over while they are trying to get an increase through the commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the first year or two of the commissioners activities under what will then be the new Transport Act, it is likely that such considerations of fare increases as they feel obliged to handle will take them a devil of a long time. It is an established fact that if new obligations are imposed or an organisation is reformed, even if the ultimate task to be carried out is reduced, it is a long time before that body starts taking less time over its reduced task than it did over its older, more extended task. This is simply because the organisation is not used to coping.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The long history of local government reform and Health Service reform in this country suggests that we are not too bright at making sure organisations given new tasks do them very well. Initially the service
	<span class='label label-info column'>820</span>
they present to the people using them—and in this case the users of the services of the traffic commissioners are bus operators—is not good. Even if the extent to which traffic commissioners become involved in adjudications of fare increases is reduced, the likelihood is that, over the first year or two of their operation, they will not be particularly good at carrying out their new tasks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have pointed out on earlier clauses, some of the established case law on matters other than fares will no longer be relevant, or only parts will be relevant and consequently a lot of time will be spent working out how to deal with the new situation. Even if there is supposedly a significant reduction in the number of adjudications about fares, there is no reason at all to assume that the commissioners will deal with them any quicker than in the past. This seems to me the main reason for the Parliamentary Secretary's advocacy of the need for no arrangements for short-term fare increases pending determination by traffic commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proof of the pudding will be in the eating, but I suspect that those who approach traffic commissioners will find that it is a pudding the traffic commissioners take a long time to chew as they gradually move into their new task. Therefore, it would be useful to introduce into the Bill a provision which coped with the problem of the operator who may be faced with a substantial increase in cost which has an immediate impact on his profit and loss account, which he would like to recoup as quickly as possible and which he cannot, or is unlikely to be able to do, because of continuing delays in adjudications by traffic commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think it is useful to expect delays to disappear overnight just because the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister or anyone else feels that the delays should be reduced. Certainly in the history of British bureaucracies, whatever task they are given they tend to become slower and slower. I do not see any reason to believe that the traffic commissioners will be different from those we have had to put up with during the last few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor is there any reason to believe that even if they reduce the amount of time which is spent on adjudicating on fares, they will not have their work cut out in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0450">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>821</span>
making other adjustments to the new legislation which faces them. Not only will they be operating in what for them is a novel sphere; they will be dealing with all sorts of other people who will not understand the Act, as the Bill will then be. The traffic commissioners' staff will spend a great deal of time giving advice to various bodies, both those with which they normally deal and the others which they will be consulting for the first time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it would seem that there are unlikely to be dramatic reductions in the time taken to consider fare increases, unless there are substantial increases in the number of staff working in traffic commissioners' offices. I do not expect that that is the Parliamentary Secretary's intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am all in favour of a reduction in delays and I think that this cause might be assisted if the hon. Gentleman restricted himself more strictly to the amendment. I cannot see any way in which on this amendment we should start discussing the staff of the traffic commissioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, Mr. English, the Parliamentary Secretary put forward as the reason why immediate "on account" increases of 15 per cent. or 10 per cent. were not a sound idea was that there would not be in future the delays which there have been in the past with the traffic commissioners considering fare increases. It seems that the manning of the traffic commissioners' offices, the other duties they will have, the variation in their duties and the extra work imposed by varying some of these duties, are relevant in considering whether the Parliamentary Secretary's answer is sufficient to persuade Opposition Members to abandon our advocacy of amendment No. 102.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not quite hear the hon. Gentleman's description of my arguments. Did he say that I had argued that there would be less delay? I argued that the traffic commissioners would not be bothered with fares controls in most cases. I would not like to put a percentage on it, but 80 per cent. or 90 per cent. of sercices will not have to go to the traffic commissioners to obtain a fares increase. The result will be that the traffic commissioners will not need more staff and there will not be these problems for operators, because there will no longer be
	<span class='label label-info column'>822</span>
any question of anything other than the judgments of the operator and the increased costs and the fares resistance on the part of the public, to be taken into account by the operator.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. Following that information, I am more lost than I was previously. What I had understood the Parliamentary Secretary to say was not only that there would be a reduction of about 80 per cent. in the number of applications to traffic commissioners, but that the 20 per cent. of applications—we are all guessing; 20 per cent. or 10 per cent.—that would still have to be made, would also be dealt with more quickly. The point I make is that I do not believe that that, certainly in the first few years, is likely to be the case. Therefore, I remain unconvinced by the hon. Gentleman's arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the additional point that I do not approve of the withdrawal of the control of fares—but that seems to be a matter for discussion on clause stand part rather than on the amendments we are considering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I hope that my right hon. Friend will continue to press amendment No. 102. It seems to be relevant and likely to affect 10 per cent. or 20 per cent. of services, and we cannot really expect any reduction in the amount of time which traffic commissioners take to consider applications for fares increases on those services over which they have decided to retain a control over fares. I hope that my right hon. Friend and the Parliamentary Secretary will accept the point we are making. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Mr. Bevan) seemed to make a very reasonable point in asking about the period and the 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. If we were to make any provision for a temporary or pending increase, or an increase on account, there ought to be some period limitation, which could be put in on Report. Ten per cent, per year is all right, or maybe 10 per cent. twice a year; but 10 per cent. once a fortnight would be getting out of hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In deciding what the law should be, we have to consider the odd sharks or villains who are floating around. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans), I do not believe that all operators are sharks. However, some of them are and we have to try to pass legislation
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0451">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>823</span>
which copes with them. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will now see some merit in amendment No. 102. If he has not been convinced by what I have said, no doubt some of my colleagues will want to emphasise the point and make it better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting to consider amendment No. 116. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary takes due cognisance of the fact that his hon.

In this debate, we have repeatedly been told that the Bill will do something for transport and will be a great thing for the public, and that all these people flooding in will reduce fares. Yet immediately his hon. Friends table an amendment allowing increases of up to 10 per cent. The Parliamentary Secretry believes in free competition, yet his hon.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hour by hour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Minute by minute. It makes sense that Conservative Members should table an amendment. I am also worried, having taken due cognisance of their policies, that 10 per cent. is too little, because of the policies the Government are carrying out day by day. If they had said "up to 10 per cent." on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday at 12 noon," that would have followed the policies they are carrying out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at the two amendments and
	<span class='label label-info column'>824</span>
realising that prices vary, one realises that there is one fundamental difference between amendment No. 102 and amendment No. 116. The fundamental difference is that amendment No. 116 is a blank cheque, because it says "subject to sub section (5)."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where it is proposed to make any change in the fares charged for any service provided under a road service licence, it shall be the duty of the holder of the licence to supply to the traffic commissioners, not later than the prescribed time before the date of the proposed change, the prescribed particulars of the proposed change."</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 116 is saying that provided that one has given the traffic commissioners, not later than the prescribed time before the date of the proposed change, the prescribed particulars of the proposed change, up fares go by 10 per cent.—end of story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is where I quarrel with it. There are riders in amendment No. 102, and the fundamental difference between Amendments Nos. 102 and 116, taking aside the 10 per cent. or 15 per cent—I would not quarrel about the figure—is that amendment No. 102 contains a proviso. There is in this amendment a prescribed motion:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the revised fares on the service introduced under this subsection shall only be charged until the traffic commissioners have considered the application made to them under paragraph (
	<i>a</i>) of this subsection."</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 116 is a blank cheque, saying that provided that they are told what will be charged, 10 per cent. may be charged. The hon. Member for Yardley made a very valid point. On Monday we notify the traffic commissioners that the fare will go up by 10 per cent. On Wednesday, under the present Government, with inflation going the way it is, we find that we need another 10 per cent. Presumably under subsection (5) we notify the traffic commissioners and up the fare goes by another 10 per cent. On Friday, again under this Government, inflation being rampant, we decide that another 10 per cent. is necessary, so under subsection (5) we notify the traffic commissioners. Within the space of a week we are talking about not 10 per cent. but 30 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 102 contains a qualification. Under this amendment, if we take the same case, we apply a 15 per cent. increase on the same Monday—subject to the traffic commissioners meeting and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0452">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>825</span>
adjudicating on the case. There is nothing in amendment No. 116 which allows anybody to arbitrate on the 10 per cent. or on the time interval. That is very important. I hope that Conservative Members who have tabled Amendment No. 116 and listened to the argument closely will now find it possible to support amendment No. 102. If the fundamental difference between us is 10 per cent. or 15 per cent., and if they take the point that there has to be some area where the operator can increase his fares, the difference boils down to whether we allow 10 per cent. ad infinitum on the basis of subsection (5) or whether we consider the interests of the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interests of the public have been hammered time and again by Conservative Members. We have been told time and again that this Bill is in the interests of the public. If that is so, and they have tabled amendment No. 116, if they believe in what they are saying about the interests of the public, surely they will now support amendment No. 102. It gives them basically what they want, with the safeguard to the public that, subsequent to the rise being made, the traffic commissioners, who will be the arbitrators, will look at that issue. If amendment No. 116 is carried, we could be talking about an increase of 30 per cent., 40 per cent. or 50 per cent. within five days, whereas with amendment No. 102 there is at least a safeguard that the traffic commissioners have to look at the specific position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Conservative Members—some seem to be holding a subcommittee meeting; I do not object to that—will now realise that what they are seeking in amendment No. 116 is not valid, but that they can achieve the object if they support amendment No. 102. I hope that the Minister, having listened carefully to what has been said, and in support of his hon. Friends who have tabled the amendment, will now seek a brief adjournment and talk to them for, say, about three-quarters of an hour, and then come back and say, with due humiliation, "We now accept that amendment No. 102 is the valid amendment and we shall accept it." Opposition Members would rise up together, clap hands and say "At last the Minister has seen the light", and we can all go home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to follow up a point
	<span class='label label-info column'>826</span>
made by the Parliamentary Secretary. It may give us an understanding of what the consequential effects of the clause will be on licenced operators in relation to fare stages. It has become clear during these debates that the clause—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that the hon. Gentleman would probably like to leave that until we come to clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since I had not said it, it is difficult to understand what you meant, Mr. English.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I withdraw and apologise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point about the amendments before us is that the Parliamentary Secretary indicated that these price increases would apply only in respect of those who, presumably, had been granted a licence and on the conditions attached as to fares. Therefore, we are dealing only with what the Parliamentary Secretary said would be approximately 20 per cent. We are not holding to the 1 per cent. or 2 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a sheer guess.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully accept that. It was the magnitude that somewhat surprised me. In an urban stage area, the reason why we have allowed controls to remain with the commissioners was that we believed that the Minister's own arguments had been that we were unsure of the competition affecting transport in those areas. I had assumed, until that remark, that in the main the attachments of licence conditions and price conditions, as considered in these amendments, would generally apply to most of the services in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does that mean, then, that in the judgment of the Minister the fare conditions applying to licences granted in urban stage areas, or the fare stage areas about which we were talking, would be to only about 20 per cent.? That is a rough figure, but the ratio would be something like that. It would be the minority of services in an area; despite the fact that the local authority, as we have decided in other clauses, will no doubt be expressing its opinion to the commissioners as to whether price conditions should be a factor
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0453">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>827</span>
in granting the licence. I had assumed up to this stage that that would probably apply to most of the bus services in fare stage areas. That clearly seems to be wrong, and I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to confirm if that is the position as he sees it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In winding up the debate, that is probably the only way in which I can take things further. When he spoke of fares control, my right hon. Friend talked of a reserve power, and we both spelt out that we regarded it as being definitely an exceptional case where the commissioners will be satisfied, to use the words of the Bill, that it is
	<br><blockquote><p>"essential in the interests of the public … to regulate the terms of competition.".</p></blockquote>
In those cases, for reasons on which I shall dwell again on clause stand part, we shall anticipate merely minimum fares being stipulated. Hence there is no need for the kind of flexibility proposed in the amendments. The amendments are aimed at the deficiencies in the present system. I hope that I have clarified for the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull (Mr. Prescott) and for my right hon. and hon. Friends that the amendments are aimed at the deficiencies in the present system but that what we are doing here renders them superfluous because there will not be the need to avoid the difficulties and delays at present experienced by operators.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I disagree entirely with what the Parliamentary Secretary contends as to whether the number affected by licence conditions makes the amendment desirable, undesirable, necessary or unnecessary. One could argue that even if only a small number were affected they should, for that reason, have greater right to expect that Parliament would favourably consider giving them some flexibility when the overwhelming majority of fellow operators were not subject to such controls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But as we are considering two amendments which give us alternative propositions, I listened with great interest to the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills) on amendment No. 116—particularly when he said that—I paraphrase—he would give us an object lesson in moving an amendment concisely. I am always willing to learn from fellow members of a Standing Committee, but, having listened to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>828</span>
way in which he moved it, I think that his introduction could be described in the same way as a lady's garment was once critically described: as not long enough to cover the subject and too short to cover the bare essentials. He redressed that to some extent in his subsequent intervention to explain the way in which the amendment related to the immediately preceding part of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Parliamentary Secretary bases his argument—as I think that he does—on the general contention that fares control over the overwhelming bulk of this area is a darned nonsense, and that the part of the clause to which the amendment relates ensures that only a relatively small number will be caught by conditions attached to licences and to fares, and therefore it is not worth doing what is proposed by the amendment, we are on a straight disagreement. But I hope that I can persuade the Parliamentary Secretary and other members of the Committee that there are two other reasons why we should consider these two arguments rather more carefully than the Parliamentary Secretary has up till now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if one allows that the numbers game is important and that the percentage is important, we have no guarantee that the percentage will be within the 80 to 90 range. I appreciate that the Parliamentary Secretary has said that this is a guess. But we need not rely on guesswork. We can, as intelligent parliamentarians, apply a judgment to the wording of the clause. That gives us a guide to approximately how many will be covered by licences which have fares control conditions attached to them, or at least to the parameters—the determinants of the number that will be covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It follows from subsection (3) that the determinants of the parameters within which this number will be set are those which follow from the controls on the traffic commissioners' use of this power. They will be only those operators who need to be controlled by the commissioners to stop them from using their road service licences unreasonably and those who need to be regulated to stop harmful competition on routes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It flows from that that, if no one acted unreasonably and no one indulged in harmful competition, we would be talking about 100 per cent. and not 80 or 90 per cent. It is assumed, if only for the purpose of the Parliamentary Secretary's guess,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0454">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>829</span>
that between 10 and 20 per cent. will breach one of those conditions. That depends on what the traffic commissioner considers to be "unreasonable use" of a road service licence. What, after all, is "unreasonable use"? It is not just a matter of what is charged. It would surely be unreasonable to use one's road service licence to operate inefficiently because of the protection afforded by it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question also arises of the circumstances in which the commissioner thinks that public interest is being damaged by competition on a route. Given what we have already decided on this clause, a traffic commissioner could take the view that in some areas competition on the route was a good thing in helping to keep fares down and to keep operators on their toes and working efficiently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A judgment is required on those two matters, and on how the traffic commissioners will interpret them, not only in the light of the clause but in the light of the general assumptions that the commissioners must make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest, in view of that, that one should not rely on the Parliamentary-Secretary's argument that so many operators will be excluded that we can cease to worry about the few who are still caught up in the procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is that, even if only a few are caught up in it, that, in some ways, makes it the more important that we should give them the flexibility which is embraced by the two amendments. I do not think that the Parliamentary Secretary's heart is in his own argument. I think his general suggestion is that fares control is a nonsense. He would far rather get rid of fares control altogether. There was a ring of conviction in his voice when he said that, and he had to say it in the context of a debate which runs against his own instincts and wishes. His political judgment is that it is better to get rid of fares control. We offer him an alternative—not to get rid of fares control altogether, but at least to open up more flexibility for those still caught by the clause.

	<p>forward for that are sound. The Parliamentary Secretary has acknowledged our intention to deal with delays by the traffic commissioners. He has acknowledged that such delays occur.</p>

	<p>I have only one more point. I think that the argument up to now has justified our voting for the amendments. But I was interested that my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) drew attention to the way in which the amendment, tabled in the name of the right hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) and his hon. Friends, operates by its relationship with subsection (5). As my hon. Friend pointed out subsection (5) depends on prescribed time and particulars for a proposed change.</p>

	<p>I believe that prescribed time in the proposed transport legislation means the time prescribed within the regulations. If that is right, it is within the Minister's control to determine how much time will elapse between the working of this amendment and the operator changing his fares. I think that an explanation is needed on that ground. If the time is considerable, surely the argument for the amendment becomes stronger, given the conditions of the amendment which I moved that the commissioner should have ultimate overriding power. I think it rests with those who moved the other amendment to make it clear whether that was their intention. I think it follows that that is the way that it would work, given that one follows through the relationship between their amendment and subsection (5). But it was not clear from the way in which it was moved or the way in which it was supported by the Government members that that was the intention.</p>

	<p>If the Parliamentary Secretary pushes us to a vote on both amendments by refusing to accept either, it would help us first to know the intention underlying amendment No. 116.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 101, in page 9, line 7, leave out from "public" to "to" in line 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make it clear at the outset that this is a probing amendment. It seeks, by the complete deletion of subsection (3)(a) to discover how the protection of the public from the unreasonable use of his licence by a licence holder is intended to operate. It seeks to discover how the Minister expects the traffic commissioners to judge the need for fares conditions on these grounds, and how safeguards against a potential abuse—which the Minister presumably believes can exist—can be imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment has been made the more pointed and relevant by the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks on the previous amendment, when he made clear, on behalf of himself and his hon. Friends, how keen they are to get rid of fares control. Yet clause 7 clearly introduces another ground upon which fares controls can be applied to a licence, the condition being that the commissioner is convinecd that it is essential in the interest of the public to protect them from unreasonable use by the holder of his licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does the Minister believe the commissioner will regard as constituting "an unreasonable use?" Presumably there are a number of unreasonable uses to which licence could be put. One could argue that it would be unreasonable, having gained a licence, not to conform with every aspect of it. It would be unreasonable to run the service badly. But that is not</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>832</span>

	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) subject to subsection (5) an established operator may vary the fares charged on his service by up to 10 per cent.".</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>—[
	<i>Mr. Booth.</i>]</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>

	<p>
	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 9.</p>

	<p>something which would be put right by fares conditions.</p>

	<p>Presumably the Minister has in mind some sort of abuse which would justify the attachment of fares conditions. The abuse might be that of charging more than the traffic commissioners thought was reasonable in all circumstances. Therefore, what the Minister contends is a general desirability to get rid of fare controls is one which he will put within tightly prescribed limits. He will say that we shall get rid of them and allow competition only within these narrow limits. I want to know the Government's intention here. Have they a clear intention on the scope of the clause, because on that scope will depend the extent to which they realise their aim of excluding as many operators as possible from licence conditions which relate to fares?</p>

	<p>There is a sense in which this matter could be seen as the sword of Damocles hanging over the operator who takes the view that, if he does certain things, the traffic commissioner will step in and bring him under fares control. I am not sure that that is the best way of dealing with this sort of abuse.</p>

	<p>The conditions attached to licences in the public interest can be many and varied and possibly, because of my different political philosophy, I do not always see that good social aims are achieved by attaching financial yardsticks to performance. But the question is relevant to the operation of this part of the clause and the bearing that it has on a number of operat-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0456">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>833</span>
ors. We have, therefore, tabled this probing amendment in the hope that we shall elucidate the matter for the operators by drawing from the Minister a description of what is intended by subsection (3)(
	<i>a</i>).</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow my right hon. Friend in supporting this probing amendment and should like to put one or two points that have occurred to me as possible abuses of the monopoly power of the operator presently covered by subsection (3)(
	<i>a</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People have talked about sharks. There are two sorts of shark against whom we may need to protect the public. There is the man-eating shark, and the basking shark. The man-eating shark might be described as the shark who is active and out to get his pound of flesh, or rather more than his pound of flesh, by exploiting to the limit his monopoly position in certain areas by making higher and higher charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have referred already to the additional tasks which the Bill places on the commissioners, despite the fact that notionally it aims to curtail the sphere of interest and consequently the work of the traffic commissioners. If subsection (3)(
	<i>a</i>) goes through as drafted, it will pose considerable problems for interpretation for the traffic commissioners. One of the questions which arises is how much and how frequent a fare increase should be and how the commissioners will judge at what point these increases become an abuse of monopoly power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A particular route might be suffering from increases of 15 or 20 per cent. every quarter. If inflation were running at 15 per cent. a quarter it would become a rather difficult judgment for the traffic commissioners to decide what constitutes, in the elegant wording of the subsection,
	<br><blockquote><p>"unreasonable use by the holder of the licence of his position as such.".</p></blockquote>
Some fairly clear guidance will need to be issued to the traffic commissioners, particularly on the fare increases which might be introduced by bus operators—licence-holders. Some additional guidance besides that given in subsection (3)(
	<i>a</i>) is necessary, possibly a percentage on top of the general rate of inflation. Without some indication of what is meant, the traffic commissioners will have an incredible problem in adjudication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) refers to the control of
	<span class='label label-info column'>834</span>
fares where it is necessary to protect the public from this unreasonable use of his position by the licence holder, or exploitation or abuse of monopoly power. That takes me to another point. One might say that the basking shark might be the idle company which, while not rocketing its fares up, kept up with the general level of fares in a certain area but fell down on other aspects of its service. Will the Minister therefore clarify whether, if a company—or the National Bus Company or a municipality—fails to keep to its timetables on certain services and sometimes fails even to provide a service, and there are general shortcomings in the way in which it meets its general obligations, it will be within the law for the commissioners to say "One way of smartening you up will be by bringing you under fares control until such time as you improve your timekeeping and general performance"? It is not clear from clause 7 that this power is related exclusively to the abuse of power by a licenceholder over fares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further point on fares that I should like clarified. If a company or statutory undertaker increases its fares on a particular route or group of routes, in such a way that the commissioners are prompted to make use of their residual powers under clause 7 to impose fare control, will they be able to impose fare control over the whole of the operations of that company in their area, or only over those routes or groups of routes on which the company has monopolistically increased its fares beyond a reasonable level?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point that needs to be made clear is that if traffic commissioners are to bring in fares control in response to exploitation, they will always be one step behind. They are not notorious for acting promptly, and, indeed, one of the complaints against them is that they have been very slow. Their residual powers will work only after someone has started exploiting his position and making substantial financial benefits. It may be months or even years before the traffic commissioners finally sort out someone who is exploiting his position and increasing fares too much. Someone who is on the make can exploit the delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Considering the way in which public bodies perform in this country, one would expect that on noting fare increases above
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0457">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>835</span>
what might be described as the going rate, the Commissioners might consider that the best way to exercise their functions would be to say to that operator "Look here, you are pushing it a bit. Why not calm down and we will not do anything more." All this could be done by a quiet word on the telephone with the chairman. The commissioners could point out that increases of 20 per cent. were a bit much, and suggest that if there were no more increases for a year, rather than nine months, the matter could be forgotten.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of time lags, there is a positive incentive for a company to exploit its positions from time to time, and thereby improve its cash flow for a short period. Perhaps it might need extra capital to buy a few more buses, for example. I envisage that a company might bash through a monopolistic increase just to give it that extra leg up. Consequently, the public will be protected by the clause, but only after the event. Knowing the way in which these things work, I think it is very unlikely that the traffic commissioners will do anything to a company that exploits its position, in less than 18 months or two years. This residual protection is almost so residual as to be no damned use at all. It demonstrates yet again the disadvantages that may flow from the semi-abolition of control of fares by traffic commissioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the value of this probing amendment, which concentrates our attention on subsection (3)(
	<i>a</i>) and on the circumstances in which traffic commissioners would impose fares control in a few cases. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman does not actually want to delete the power, because he believes more strongly in fares control than I do. However, I shall take this opportunity to explain the Government's reason for retaining it at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill accepts the need for licensing outside trial areas—that is, road service licensing and quantity control. It is the nature of a licence to give someone a particularly protected position in what otherwise would be a free market. In certain circumstances, it will quite properly give rise to a monopoly position being established in the interest of a community's transport needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one grants a licence to a monopoly
	<span class='label label-info column'>836</span>
of any sort, there is a need for a residual power to protect the public against abuse of it. It would not be right to recognise the continued existence of licence monopolies in some cases without making sure that advantage is not taken by imposing unnecessary charges on the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where there is a free market, as there will be in trial areas, we see no case for any sort of fares control, because competition and customer resistance will be the best control of fares level. In fact, irrespective of whether there is licensing, I believe that the reality of bus transport is that there are real constraints on the ability of an operator to put up fares, because there is real passenger resistance and loss of revenue if he overdoes it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there will be restricted cases where at present we are contemplating the existence of a licence and of a potential monopoly, and therefore there will be the possibility of abuse. That is what the provision is intended to cover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure was described by the right hon. Gentleman as possibly being a sword of Damocles hanging over operators' heads. The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) was concerned about the delay that might occur before the public were protected. I see the matter as falling somewhat between those two views. The fact that there is such a reserve power will act as a warning to operators. If, as the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South said, they were to start overdoing it on a certain route and coming up with gross fare increases that aroused public resentment, in the back of their minds would be the thought that the traffic commissioners would examine the matter with a view to stepping in and imposing fare conditions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary is making an important point. Can he tell me how it will be decided when monopoly abuse has arisen? What factors will be looked for?

If so, I would greatly welcome it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question of the factors that traffic commissioners will bear in mind was raised by the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South. First, let
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0458">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>837</span>
me rule out one of those that he suggested. I cannot envisage circumstances in which the traffic commissioners would want to use fares control as a sort of punitive measure for other deficiencies in service. We are concerned only with cost and price at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there is excessive profit making—with which we have already dealt—and extracting a quite unreasonable rate of return from a service to a captive public. Secondly, there is the far more insidious form of abuse of the monopoly position that I believe to be far more prevalent. That is the monopolist—or the "basking shark"—who uses his position to maintain a level of costs and inefficiency in management that would be insupportable if he was exposed to any form of competition. At present in this country there are some operators whose general fare levels are vastly above the prevailing levels for very similar operators in other parts of the country. Such operators are not usually making huge profits—they are badly organised with a high cost base and do not have the advantages of the stimulus of competition. It seems equally valid for the traffic commissioners to look at both of those cases, as both are an abuse of monopoly—the first with high profits and the second with a cushioned existence, high costs, bad management, over-manning and so on—that the public pay for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in the end it will be for the traffic commissioners to decide on the facts in each case. They will be notified of all fare increases, as the notes on clauses indicate, and then of their own volition will have to consider whether to attach fares conditions. Of course, they will have to give notice if they do so and the operator will be entitled to make representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the prevailing view in the Committee on fares control, I certainly expect the Opposition to accept the need for subsection (3)(
	<i>a</i>) because they have great faith in fares control for protecting the public in these circumstances. From our point of view, we accept that if we leave open the possibility for licenced monopolies we cannot rely on competition alone. We must have a reserve power whereby the commissioners could step in to stop abuse and protect the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment proposes that the traffic commissioners should be required to consider any objections or representations of the licence holder before deciding to attach fares conditions to the licence currently in force.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment can be introduced very briefly, provided that it is accepted that this in no way detracts from its importance. In tabling the amendment my hon. Friends and I seek to demonstrate that we believe that it is of considerable importance that traffic commissioners should not attach a fares condition to a licence without giving the operator who is working under that licence the chance to make representations. That is the sole point of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the operator could appeal against the decision of the commissioner to attach a licence without having considered his objections or representations. But the appeal process is rather lengthy and expensive. It would be unreasonable and unfair to involve an operator in the expense, difficulty, time and staffing requirements to tackle an appeal procedure as a result of the failure to include in the Bill a simple requirement for the commissioner to listen to representations or objections before he takes a decision to attach or vary a condition.

If the Minister accepts the principle I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment at this stage in return for an undertaking that he will deal with the subject in his own words. The proposition can be

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can deal with this by an undertaking. The main point of the amendment is the common sense proposition that before conditions are attached the holder of the licence is entitled to make representations in his own defence. I entirely accept that principle. It is clearly essential that the holder should be given notice of the commissioner's intention and be able to make representations in return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The procedures involved are covered by regulations. Existing regulations provide that the commissioners only attach or vary conditions after considering any objection or representation. At present licence holders are given notice and time in which to object. I give a firm undertaking that the necessary regulations will be made, and that they will preserve what is only natural justice for the licenceholder—the right to make submissions as to why fares control should not be attached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is purely a drafting amendment, intended to ensure that the reference to a licence in page 9, line 12 is to a road service licence. There was a slight error in drafting the section. The line
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the holder of such a licence"</p></blockquote>
is intended to refer back to subsection (2), which mentions a road service licence. But there is too long a gap between the two references.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not make a great issue of this debate because a number of understandings have been reached. I shall not delay the Committee on the principles of the agreement, but, clearly, clause 7 is an important clause. However, I am surprised—though it is clearly set out in the interpretations in the Bill—because I had assumed that the relevant licence applications in urban areas would have been largely applicable to all bus operations. Clearly, that will not happen, as was demonstrated in the rough estimate which the Parliamentary Secretary gave. He said that probably 20 per cent. would be the number to which these licences would apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view, that would have a catastrophic effect on bus systems in urban areas, which we thought—as was suggested in the consultative document—would still be controlled by licensing, and licensing to be covered and supported by fare applications. The subject has been well debated, and I do not intend to take the matter any further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have been approached on the subject of certain clauses—including clause 7—concerning the considerations of the commissioners, especially in dealing with fares. These matters have been raised by a number of people who have complained to the commissioners, since those matters are considered as a possibility for protest. They wonder whether the commissioners could consider holding sittings in the evenings as well as in the afternoons. That may be a common complaint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We promised to raise the matter, and I have raised it with the traffic com-

	<span class='label label-info column'>841</span>
missioners themselves. In Leeds, where strong representations have been made, it was felt that, particularly for people who are at work during the day, it might be better if traffic commissioners could consider the possibility of hearing representations in the evening as well as during the day. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to give me an answer on that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a most interesting debate on the clause. It has revealed some interesting developments. I particularly welcome the widespread withdrawal of traffic commissioners from the area of fares determination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put one question to the Parliamentary Secretary. From my limited experience, it seems to me that many of the objections in the past to fare increases have come from local authorities. That subject has stimulated many of the lengthy hearings which have consumed so much time and money. Am I right in saying that henceforth local authorities will not have that statutory right to object to fare increases by bus companies? I ask that question because the matter has involved such widespread activity on the part of councillors. If it is an area in which they will not be directly involved in the future, that fact should be more widely known.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In clause 7, holders of road service licences are required to notify the traffic commissioners of changes of fares in the prescribed time before the date of the proposed change. Surely, the prescribed time should be specified in the Bill. It should not be less than two months, according to the advice given to us by the London Transport Passengers Committee, an independent body representing the interests of passengers on London Transport's bus and underground services. That body recommends that
	<br><blockquote><p>"operators should in addition be required to advertise such charges in local newspapers".</p></blockquote>
I support that point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My trade union, the Transport and General Workers Union, makes the following comments on clause 7:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Bill states that the commissioners should not exercise their power to set minimum or maximum fares unless it is essential to protect the public or to regulate the terms of competition. Unprofitable routes are operated now because they are cross-subsidised by the profitable routes. A private operator gaining a licence for any one
	<span class='label label-info column'>842</span>
of the profitable routes could run it at lower fares than the public service and still make a profit, forcing the public service to reduce its fares and less able to maintain its unprofitable sections. Or the private operator could gamble on providing a service on an unprofitable route, milking passengers from the public bus service until that service disappears, then either raise the fares in the absence of any competition or lose the gamble and leave the community without any service at all.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>While it is unlikely that a rush of private firms will want to take on local transport, those that do will obviously choose the profitable routes and severely weaken public transport's ability to maintain a full network.".</p></blockquote>
Finally, my own regional council, Strathclyde, has written to me expressing concern about clause 7. Mr. Bryson, clerk to the highways and transportation committee, on which I served as a member from 1974 to 1979, has made representations to me on behalf of the council. This representation points out that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 7 of the Bill restricts severely the circumstances in which the Traffic Commissioners will be able to impose conditions regarding fares. In their policy document the Government explained the purpose of this restriction in the following terms:—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'The fares control exercised by the Traffic Commissioners is now one of the very few price controls in the economy. It is detailed, time-consuming and expensive. It is not clear that bus services merit this special restriction. Bus operators know of the effects of fare increases on the demand for their services and where revenue support is being paid the influence of the county council"—</p></blockquote>
or regional council—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is often a more significant constraint than the need for approval from the Traffic Commissioners. But it can also be argued that fares control is an unavoidable part of a protective licensing system; if routine fares control were to be removed some form of reserve power might still need to be retained for use in limited circumstances. Views would be welcomed on this.'</p></blockquote>
The P.T.E."—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
that is the Greater Glasgow passenger transport executive, which is part of Strathclyde regional council—
	<br><blockquote><p>"at the time commented as follows:—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"It appears fundamental to the fulfilment of statutory responsibilities that there should be some power over the setting of fare levels. However, it can be held that the local authority, with statutory responsibility for public transport, could hold this power. Fares control is essential to the implementation of plans for co-ordination and integration. Streamlining of procedures is to be welcomed provided that at least some reserve power is retained. It is difficult to see how practical stage carriage licensing could remain without control of fares to be charged on such services. Cross-subsidisation of uneconomic services from more lucrative routes

	<span class='label label-info column'>843</span>
could be at risk if all fares controls are removed'—and the views were transmitted to the Government.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Now that the Bill has been published it can be seen that the Government's wish is to permit the Traffic Commissioners to impose conditions regarding fares only (
	<i>a</i>) to protect the public from a monopoly situation; or (
	<i>b</i>) to regulate competition between stage carriage services.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>This does not seem to the Regional Council to give them a reasonable basis on which to coordinate transport services within the Region. If the assumption were made that all bus services were in receipt of subsidy the level of that subsidy would provide the Regional Council with a sanction they could impose on operators to regulate the level and costs of services to meet the needs of the community. But where an operator is not in receipt of subsidy the Regional Council would be virtually powerless. The Regional Council have already had experience of a situation where a major operator sought, by cutting back services and increasing fares, to be in the position where they could decline subsidy from the Regional Council and would therefore be free of control.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>In all these circumstances it seems to the Regional Council that the Traffic Commissioners should have some power in circumstances other than those referred to above to impose conditions regarding fares where they feel this is justifiable.".</p></blockquote>
It would be appropriate, perhaps on Report, to put down an amendment to meet the point made by Strathclyde regional council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can satisfy the Committee by giving an explanation of what will happen when clause 7 comes into effect, which is what I have been asked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All operators would usually, when making their next application for a fares increase—at the moment they ah have the present fares controls—include together with the application, an application under clause 7(4), asking the traffic commissioners to remove all conditions governing fares applying to their service. I should imagine that from now on we shall find that all operators will seek to have fares conditions removed from their services. It is my expectation that the vast majority of those applications will be granted. The fares conditions will be removed and there will exist re-regulated prices for most services, for the reason explained by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Mr. Marshall). There is no reason for singling out bus transport in this way for largely ineffective fares control and to rely on the various other features to which we have already referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all those cases where there are no onger fares conditions, it will still be
	<span class='label label-info column'>844</span>
necessary to inform the traffic commissioners under clause 5 every time there is a fares increase, so that the traffic commissioners will be able to keep under review the fares pattern in their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be for the commissioners themselves to decide whether a situation is arising on a route or combination of routes which might justify the imposition of fares conditions for the reasons set out in the Bill. If they reach the decision that there is enough information to justify doing that, they will notify the licence holder of their intention, hold a hearing and listen to all representations and objections from the holder of the licence, who will put forward a case giving the reasons why fares conditions should not be put on that licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) asked about local authorities. At present many of them expect to make submissions and objections every time there is a fares application. Frequently local authorities go through the motions of pacifying a pressure group among their constituents, although they know perfectly well that the fares increase is inevitable and will be allowed. Behind the scenes the local authorities actively encourage operators to make the application. But I leave that gloss aside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But true—as the hon. Member said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How do we avoid that happening in every case even now? Many local authorities will make submissions to the traffic commissioners when they hear of a fares increase, inviting the traffic commissioners to impose fares conditions. The traffic commissioners will read letters and receive and read submissions by local authorities, but they will not normally move towards making fares conditions or hold a hearing to consider the possibility unless they are disposed to accept what the local authority says and the traffic commissioners themselves have decided that there appears to be evidence which will justify the fares conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the time, even where local authorities make representations, we shall not go through the performance of a public hearing every time. The traffic commissioners will retain the power to decide
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0462">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>845</span>
for themselves when to look into the possibility of fares controls, issue the full warning and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If by any chance it does not work like that, because the traffic commissioners are, quite rightly, independent people—all that we are doing is changing the law in a way in which we believe puts them in that position, because it is now very much a reserve power—we can continue to monitor the situation. The details can and will be influenced by Ministers when necessary using the regulation-making power with which clause 7 begins:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to subsection (3) and any regulations".</p></blockquote>
I assure hon. Gentlemen that in practice it turns out that we are slipping back into the old system of fares control because people cannot break habits and it is regarded as necessary to go through the full hearings in a large number of cases. My right hon. Friend and myself will consider the regulation-making power, in order to make clear the basis upon which we would like the traffic commissioners to act and to ensure that the reserve power is a reserve power and does not place undue and onerous burdens and inflexibilities upon the operators of public transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) asked about evening sittings—a matter in which we all have an interest. As with any court or tribunal, it seems inescapable that that has to be left to the traffic commissioners. It is, of course, more convenient for many members of the public if they could sit in the evenings, but the difficulties are predictable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that the traffic commissioners have difficulties in persuading staff to sit in the evenings and have difficulties also with local authority staff who will not come along in the evenings to take part in the hearings. It is therefore, left to the traffic commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Committee might usefully reflect on the astonishing patience of the staff of the House of Commons and Government Departments who tolerate sittings at 5.20 a.m.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment does not need much explanation, as it is self-explanatory. The sense of clause 8, as I read it, is that if no other transport facilities are available, the application can, near enough, go through willy nilly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments purport to say that there might be objections of some sort. Therefore, to give the clause additional flexibility for whatever might arise—there could be things that we have not yet thought of—we think that the amendments are reasonable and we hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will respond accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is another amendment upon which there is entire agreement as to its purpose. I hope that again I can answer it by giving an undertaking that it will be covered by regulations and by the traffic commissioners' discretionary powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations will require the traffic commissioners both to publish applications—they will be for road service licences, and there will not be a separate type of application—and then to consider representations made to them. Beyond that, the traffic commissioners have discretionary powers to consult any interested parties, including local authorities and other operators, in order to satisfy themselves if the grant of a licence, under either clause 8 or clause 9 provisions, is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can conceive of no situation in which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0463">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>847</span>
it will be possible for a licence under clause 8 provisions to be granted or refused without the traffic commissioners considering objections or representations. The necessary regulations will ensure that they are both empowered and obliged to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->

	<br><blockquote><p>"and shall do so in accordance with the application except to the extent that they are satisfied that to do so would be against the interest of the public".</p></blockquote>
This amendment is designed to require the traffic commissioners, in granting a licence under the clause 8 provisions, which are a replacement of the old section 30 licences—for a route where no other transport facilities are available, to do so in accordance with the application, unless, in their view, it would be against the public interest to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is to install in the clause, for the avoidance of doubt, the familiar concept of the interest of the public as the overriding consideration for the traffic commissioners. It makes it clear that they will be obliged to grant the application in accordance with the terms of the application unless they are satisfied that to do so would be against the public interest. Therefore, the amendment is entirely consistent with the principles that we have already discussed on clause 5.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister explain the reason for subsection (3), which provides that no appeal shall lie under section 27 from a decision of the traffic commissioners to refuse to grant a road service licence pursuant to the section? I am puzzled as to why an applicant should not have recourse to a Minister if he feels he has been unreasonably refused a licence under this provision. Again, would an
	<span class='label label-info column'>848</span>
aggrieved applicant have the right to go to court to assert his right to a licence under this provision if he felt that it had been unreasonably refused, arguing that there was no alternative service and that he should be granted a licence?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause clearly lays an obligation on the traffic commissioners to grant a licence unless there is overwhelming evidence that it is against the public interest. Would the commissioners still be able to attach conditions as to fares under clause 7, or other conditions under clause 6? The reason I ask is that an obligation to grant a licence could be worthless if the commissioners had the power at the same time to impose fare conditions or other conditions which rendered their licence unattractive to the applicant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause replaces the old section 30 position. It will apply in every application for a road service licence. The commissioners will begin by having to consider whether the application is a case where no other transport facilities are available to meet the reasonable needs of the route. This is an area where there is no competitor, therefore it is hardly conceivable that anyone will object to anyone trying to run a bus service, and a quick and easy procedure is wanted here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If they are satisfied that there are no other transport facilities, the commissioners must automatically grant a clause 8 licence. If they are not satisfied, they will not dismiss the application for a road service licence. They will go on to consider the application for a road service licence in the usual, more elaborate way—holding a hearing, listening to representations, and so on. If that is refused—at the end of the process there can again be a refusal to grant the licence—the ordinary rights of appeal will lie and the refused applicant can go to the Minister and apply for his road service licence. All clause 8 provides is that there is no right of appeal if the traffic commissioners decide at the first stage that it is not an automatic clause 8 case. To put in a right of appeal at that stage would frustrate the whole point of a quick and easy preliminary procedure to deal with the no-problem cases where there is no other operator in sight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is correct that under clause 8, as it is a road service licence that is being issued,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0464">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>849</span>
conditions may be attached along the lines that we have already discussed on clauses 6 and 7, where the commissioners are satisfied that it is appropriate to do so in the circumstances set out. If it is one that requires complicated conditions, I think that it is highly unlikely to fall within the clause 8 category. Certainly, if there is no other operator on the route and no other transport facilities are available, it is difficult to see how fares control would actually be necessary or applicable, and so forth. But technically, as a matter of law, the straight answer to my hon. Friend's question is that under the Bill as it stands it would certainly be possible to attach both clause 6 and clause 7 conditions to a clause 8 road service licence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>No. 109, in page 10, leave out lines 28 to 30.</p>

	<p>No. 117, in page 10, line 29, leave out paragraph (1)(
	<i>b</i>).</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 9 simplifies the licensing procedure for excursions or tours within a 30-mile radius, longer tours being totally delicensed. It provides that for applicants to benefit from the simplified procedure the traffic commissioners must be satisfied that the excursions or tours do not compete directly with existing licensed services. That seems to me to be a reasonable basis, and the wording of paragraph (
	<i>a</i>) is such that the commissioners have flexibility in seeing that the best balance of service is maintained. I think that that is reasonable, because the excursions or tours may compete directly with regular scheduled services, as is clearly recognised in the wording of paragraph (
	<i>a</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first question that arises, therefore,
	<span class='label label-info column'>850</span>
is why it is sensible to allow direct competition in the case of a "special event" if it is not allowed in the case of the excursion or tour or a "special occasion". Why has the existing phrase "special occasion" been changed? Is there any difference between a special occasion and a special event for the purpose of the clause? Even at this late hour, the Minister should explain the significance of that change. If there is no hidden reason, it might be thought that a "special event" could be interpreted in the same way as a "special occasion".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, I am advised that the position in law is far from clear cut. There has been a number of High Court actions on it, so it is not an academic point. I am advised that in the case of Nelson 
	<i>v.</i> Blackford 1936, where the purpose of the journey was to view the Blackpool illuminations to celebrate the Jubilee of King George V, the illuminations continuing for 49 days, it was held that it was not a special occasion. In the case of Browning 
	<i>v.</i> J. W. H. Watson (Rochester) Ltd. in which the hire of a motor coach to take club members to a nearby town to watch a football league match gave rise to the action, because the football matches were to be held on six Saturdays during the period August to November, they were held to be special occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not bore the Committee with all the cases. I will give just one more. In the case of Wurzel 
	<i>v.</i> Dowker, in which on seven successive Sundays a motor coach was hired to take all the members of a working men's club on fishing trips, it was held that those were not special occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the basis of the decisions taken in the court, therefore, there is some doubt. It seems that this is particularly confusing in the decision on Browning 
	<i>v.</i> J. W. H. Watson (Rochester) Ltd., where it was held that regular trips to home matches of a league football club were special occasions. It seems open to speculation whether Blackpool illuminations, though not a special occasion, may be held to be a special event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have, albeit briefly, shown that there is considerable uncertainty about the clause in its present form, which justifies the amendment. I hope that the Minister will be able to meet us on this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Neale</div> <!-- member -->

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0465">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>851</span>
points made by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth). If there is to be licensing of services in any sense, the provision is an undue threat to it. Subsection (1) (
	<i>a</i>) states that a licence would not be granted if a service competed directly with an existing road service licence, but it would be possible to make sure that the service competed only indirectly and was still within the definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the right hon. Gentleman's view about the definition. If any member of the Committee were to go to my constituency in North Cornwall—in which they would be most welcome—and visit the Royal Cornwall show, I think that they would agree that it was a special event. But if they went to one of the local markets—while one could organise a service that competed only indirectly with an existing licensed service—they might consider that a special event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tell the Committee with great pleasure that the Parliamentary Secretary is due to visit my constituency shortly, and as part of his advance literature his photograph has been sent to the lady members of my association. The visit is seen by them as a very special event. Had the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Penhaligon) had the tenacity and perseverence of the rest of us and had been here during the night, I am sure he would have disagreed that that was a special event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having listened to the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) and to his description of the situation in North Cornwall in particular, I am sure that if anyone suggested running any sort of bus or coach into North Cornwall, he would look upon it as a special event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give one final example. The Padstow "obby-oss" day on 1 May is a famous occasion and is a fertility rite event. I am certain that some people of the appropriate age would consider that a special event. But parents of children of impressionable age able to realise their fertility would wish to ensure that it was not treated as a special event. My constituency has many pensioners and I hardly think that they would view it as a special event. There are many ways of interpreting that event and hon. Members may wish to place their own interpretation upon "obby-oss" day. I think that it shows that the clause is ineffective and I wish to see it withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>852</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can satisfy hon. Members on both sides on this point. Clause 9 is something of an anomaly because we have excluded from licensing excursions and tours over 30 miles. We toyed with the idea of excluding all excursions and tours, but there are plainly circumstances where they could be thinly-disguised ways of competing with existing stage carriage services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the need to protect stage carriage services in certain circumstances, we could not do that—hence the need for clause 9 and hence the understandable concern of bus operators of all kinds to make sure that it does not open up the loophole that will make them vulnerable to particular competition, but I do not think that it will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be no problem with paragraph (
	<i>a</i>)—the amendment is not related to it anyway—where there is no competing road service licence. With regard to paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) and the definition of special events, I point out to my hon. Friend and the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) how this will arise. The traffic commissioners will have to give a road service licence to an excursion tour if they are satisfied—the burden is to establish it to them—that the licence refers to something that can properly be called a special event and also, as can be seen from the wording of the paragraph, that it is being operated only to enable passengers to attend such a special event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What amounts to a special event could, it is true, be arguable in certain circumstances. It turns out that this point has been litigated in somewhat bizarre circumstances at various times. A special occasion must be a particular and individual occasion, but the words have given rise to litigation in the past. Litigation will not arise for this reason. The cases cited by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness arose out of former legislation, when these excursions and tours were outside licensing altogether. Therefore, the litigation, for the most part, arose when there was a dispute as to whether a service had been run without a licence which it should have had. That all depended upon whether it was a special event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the clause the commissioners will have a discretion. It is for them to decide whether they are satisfied that it is a special event and they are under no duty to issue a licence unless they are so satisfied.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0466">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>853</span>
We can rely on traffic commissioners to use their common sense and ordinary judgment and to realise that a football match or a festival, such as the variety of festivals held all over Cornwall for various purposes, or other great occasions—horse races and so on—are special events. But—to cite one case—weekly fishing trips, where every Friday someone goes along a set route all the year round, are not a whole series of special events, but are in a different category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Traffic commissioners exercise a discretion and have to be satisfied before they issue road service licences. I should have thought, therefore, that operators could accept that traffic commissioners, with their general duties and approach to public transport, will not allow people to make representations to them about thinly-disguised, so-called special events and then start granting road service licences in such a way as to undermine the stage carriage operators in their area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the traffic commissioners who entertain these applications will have to be satisfied, with their experience in passenger transport, they will be critical of bogus claims.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend justify the absence of a right of appeal? In view of the disputes that exist about the definition of an event, there could be circumstances in which a person would feel aggrieved that the commissioners had declined to give him a licence for what he considered to be a special event. Why should that person not have a right of appeal somewhere?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: He will, in the same circumstances as those provided for in clause 8. If the special event is genuine, he will be in trouble, because by the time he has gone through the process of appealing, it may be long after the cup final, for example. Nevertheless—this again is a quick procedure—so long as the service is an excursion or tour which is either not competing or is going to a special event, a road service licence must be issued and be issued quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the commissioner decides that it is not a special event, or is not satisfied and wants to hear further argument, or rejects a clause 9 application, he still has to consider the application for a road service licence: he has to proceed in the ordinary way, hold hearings if pressed to do so and
	<span class='label label-info column'>854</span>
hear representations. Then, if the application is refused at that stage, there is a right of appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But once more it would not be appropriate to provide a right of appeal for what is meant to be a quick preliminary stage in clear-cut cases. The correct course, if an application is turned down, is to go through the proper procedure of applying for a road service licence, with all the rights of appeal which follow a refusal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The motor show would rate as a special event for the purpose of many excursions and tours coming from all over the country, although again it would be for the traffic commissioners to decide on the facts of any application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question whether certain circumstances should involve a further application to the local authorities receiving the traffic, say, in Blackpool for the illuminations or in Birmingham at the National Exhibition Centre, is one to which I shall give thought. But my initial reaction is that such traffic management problems, which are one of the duties of the transport authority, would be difficult to incorporate into applications for road service licences. I know as well as my hon. Friend that the motor show causes a fantastic amount of traffic to pour into
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0467">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>855</span>
the vicinity of Birmingham, but it is in the nature of special events that they attract traffic and traffic jams. Anyone who goes to the cup final normally has the opportunity to see a fairly spectacular traffic jam which lasts for a very long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has never in the past been the practice that excursions and tours have been subject to any kind of extra traffic management hoop through which they must go before they can run their coaches to the cup final, the Blackpool illuminations, the motor show, the Derby or any great event. I regret to say that my initial reaction is that I find it difficult to envisage how such a provision can be incorporated. I fear that, in the end, one will be left with the kind of efforts which the West Midlands county council and the police forces concerned have to make at the moment to try to minimise the traffic going to certain events and even to spread out the special events.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that connection the Department of Transport has contact with the councils, which are particularly anxious that the motor show should not coincide with football matches. But I fear that that goes well into the realm of local authority traffic responsibilities, and I cannot readilly see any way of incorporating such a provision in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Member of Parliament for the area in which the National Exhibition Centre is located, I assure my hon. Friend that in the past, particularly last year at the motor show, the co-operation between the local authorities was extremely successful. We should like to believe that the same measures will continue. We congratulate the Ministry of Transport and those others on the measures that were taken, in co-operation with the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, in ensuring that last year's standards, which were highly acceptable to the residents, are maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a resident of the area, I remember that the prevailing local belief was that the measures would not work, that the rail and road systems could not accommodate the number of people who would come. Anybody who went to the show knows that a vast number of people came. I believe that the number greatly exceeded any of the previous attendances at the show in London. Yet, probably by a
	<span class='label label-info column'>856</span>
close-run thing, the transport system accommodated the crowds which came.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we should not go into the local traffic problems of the West Midlands any further, but we hope that the same cooperation and success prevails as last year. As I say, I have no doubt that my hon. Friend is aware of the serious problem that great difficulties could arise if first division home football matches were allowed to coincide with the motor show on a Saturday. I am sure that the residents concerned will all hope that an agreement can be reached whereby the home football matches can be moved to a more sensible time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make a proposal which might facilitate progress? It seems to me that all the members of the Committee, other than the Minister, who have spoken to these amendments have underlined the fact that they deal with a real problem. The Minister may have convinced others that, while he is seized of the problem, he cannot see an immediate solution to it. Would it therefore facilitate matters if I were to withdraw the amendment at this stage, in the hope that between now and Report we might be able to reach agreement with the Minister on a better amendment, if either of us can find one? If not, we might return on Report to try to deal with the matter by a contested amendment. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 110, in page 10, line 23, leave out "directly" and insert "in any way".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to ensure that applications for licences for excursions or tours are granted automatically and as applied for only when there is no competition, direct or indirect, with licensed bus services other than excursions and tours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without the amendment it would be possible for ordinary bus services, in the absence of a clear definition of direct competition, to be subject to serious competition from excursions, particularly as no conditions on fares, routes, dates or times of operation could be attached, in the public interest, to the relevant road service licences granted automatically under the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such competition with the local bus services would not be in the public interest. Where any possibility of such competition
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0468">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>857</span>
exists, the traffic commissioners should be obliged to consider the application for a licence for a new excursion or tour under the provisions of clause 5(2) and (3). It is an important point which does not cut across what I take to be the primary aim of the clause and I hope that it will commend itself to the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman moves the amendment with commendable brevity, but it is an important matter which perhaps requires further consideration and a reserve reply from my right hon. Friend and myself on Thursday morning. That suggestion seems to meet with general approval. There have, I understand, been discussions about these matters through channels to which, as I have been in the Committee, I have not been party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>858</span>
However, I must warn the Committee that, although we have made satisfactory progress, it is my feeling that we have reserved for ourselves a great deal of work on Thursday night. I trust that that is appreciated by right hon. and hon. Members on both sides. As they may have discovered already—if they have not, they will discover—I happen to be one of those people who does not sleep much at nights anyway, so I am quite free myself. Nevertheless, probably enough is enough for tonight and I therefore suggest that further proceedings on the Committee be now adjourned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
