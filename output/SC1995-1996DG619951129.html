	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. Jonathan Evans)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft County Courts (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 1995.</p></blockquote>
I begin by saying what a great pleasure it is to serve in this Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Sims. It is the first time that I have had the opportunity of addressing the Committee in this capacity under your chairmanship, although on many occasions in the past you and I have been engaged in debates on law reform matters of mutual interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is a relatively straightforward measure to amend the principal legislation governing county courts in Northern Ireland so as to enhance the existing powers of those courts to make orders in relation to the disclosure of documents and the inspection of property. Unlike the High Court in Northern Ireland and the civil courts in England and Wales, county courts in Northern Ireland do not presently have the power to make orders in respect of third party and pre-proceedings discovery. The purpose of the order is to meet the concerns caused by the absence of such powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Accordingly, the order will insert three new articles into the County Courts (Northern Ireland) Order 1980 allowing a party to certain proceedings to seek access to relevant documents which are not under his control or that of any other party to the proceedings. Similary he will be able to ask the court to allow him to inspect property belonging neither to him nor to any other party to the proceedings. Where proceedings have not yet commenced but are likely to do so, a person will also be able to seek an order for access to documents or property which are likely to be relevant in those proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is necessary because a significant amount of the work formerly undertaken in the High Court in Northern Ireland has now been transferred to the county court as a result of changes to county court limits. I am given to understand that something in the order of 60 per cent. of the work previously undertaken by the High Court may be transferred. It is, therefore, important that the powers currently available to the High Court in Northern Ireland are also available to the county court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that members of the Committee will share my belief that it is important that county courts in Northern Ireland should have the powers that are conferred by the order. The order was subject to public consultation and has been widely welcomed in
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Northern Ireland by senior judges, practitioners and other interested persons who commented on it. It represents a useful enhancement of the powers of county courts in Northern Ireland and I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.33 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to welcome the Minister to his new post: this is probably his first public outing as the Lord Chancellor's representative on earth. I am sure that he was as interested in what he was going to say as we were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This proposal is not controversial. As the Minister said, it was put out to consultation and was broadly welcomed. I would like to ask the Minister two questions. First, the order seems to bring into line county court and High Court procedure in Northern Ireland. The Law Society of Northern Ireland raised the particular issue of whether it would be appropriate to bring that procedure into line with the procedure in England and Wales. I realise that that would require different legislation, but I would like to know the Minister's view. Is it intended to introduce legislation to harmonise the procedures in Northern Ireland and England and Wales? I am not urging the Minister to do that or taking a line on it, but merely asking whether that is the Government's intention at some stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I would like to refer to article 42C, which specifically forbids an order being made if compliance
	<br><blockquote><p>"would be likely to be injurious to the public interest."</p></blockquote>
It is interesting that this measure is trying to bring procedure in the county court into line with that in the High Court, but there is a divergence, albeit a minor one, between article 42C and High Court Rule 18. High Court Rule 18 expresses the public interest protection as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The foregoing provisions of this Order shall be without prejudice to any rule of law which authorises or requires the withholding of any document on the ground that the disclosure of it would be injurious to the public interest".</p></blockquote>
Article 42C, referring to the county court, does not say "would be injurious" to the public interest, but refers to the likelihood of injury to the public interest. That is a reduction in the standard of proof for the county court as against the High Court. In a measure that ostensibly brings into line High Court and county court procedure, I wonder why there is a difference in the standard of proof.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from those two points, like those who responded to the consultation process, we support this measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.36 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Maginnis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome this measure, which will enable county courts to fulfil their responsibilities as now defined. In Northern Ireland, it is vital that the rule of law and its enforcement should operate efficiently and as promptly as possible. It is hoped that the transfer of some responsibilities for the administration of law from the High Court to the county courts will enable
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0591">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
justice to be meted out more quickly and more efficiently than has been the case in the past. In that respect, we welcome the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) for distilling his remarks to two questions. His intuitive approach is helpful when seeking clarification of such important issues. I hope that I can reassure him on both points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, he referred to legislation in England and Wales. As I understand it, the legislation varies slightly between England and Wales and Northern Ireland. I have looked at the historical position, but I am bound to inform the Committee that I cannot explain why that is so. While I support the argument that in Northern Ireland different provisions may be necessary to reflect local circumstances, for the most part it is desirable to have the same operation of law in Northern Ireland as in England and Wales. As a Welsh Member of Parliament, I strongly believe that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the context of this legislation, however, legal opinion is divided as to whether the Northern Ireland High Court procedure is better than the procedure in England and Wales. Although I take the hon. Gentleman's point, this proposal is not disadvantageous and it is right for us to take this initial step to bring procedures in the county court in Northern Ireland into line with procedures in the High Court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's second point relates to article 42C. He may be aware that when my right hon. Friend the Lord Chancellor addressed the other place on this matter and explained article 42C, some of his remarks were taken out of context. As a result, on 28 November he wrote to two contributors to the debate clarifying the position on article 42C. I can do no better to reassure the hon. Gentleman than to quote briefly a relevant paragraph from the letter:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In fact, the purpose of the prohibition imposed by Article 42C(1) is the same or the identical prohibition which already applies to the Northern Ireland High Court and the civil courts in
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
England and Wales. This means that, where any issue of prejudice to the public interest arises in the course of proceedings, whether by way of a ministerial certificate"</p></blockquote>
which we know as a public interest immunity certificate—
	<br><blockquote><p>"or otherwise, the county court judge will have a responsibility to consider whether disclosure is precluded by the terms of the new provision in the same way as a High Court judge faced with the same issue."</p></blockquote>
I noted the point made by the hon. Gentleman about the terminology, but the letter suggests that in the circumstances, it is clearly intended that the provision should follow the terminology of the Lord Chancellor's letter. The hon. Gentleman might not have seen the letter and, given that it would be desirable were Ito arrange for a copy to be forwarded to him, I will do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That said, I hope that the Committee will concur with the general view from both the hon. Gentleman and from the Opposition spokesman that the measure is a useful addition to the powers of the Northern Ireland county courts. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
