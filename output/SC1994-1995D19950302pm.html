	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned the sitting this morning, the hon. Member for Durham, North-West (Ms Armstrong) was addressing the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hilary Armstrong 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Durham, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Welcome back to the Chair, Mr. Winterton. I am happy that you are here so that we can make good progress with the rest of the Bill. My voice is improving slightly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause refers to profit-related pay and the way in which the Government are changing the guidelines on how it can be claimed. My attention has been drawn to a survey that was carried out by the Pay and Benefits Bulletin along with Bucks Consultants. They questioned organisations on a range of issues dealing with performance-related pay. They asked 198 organisations to specify the single most important objective for their organisation to introduce profit-related pay, and received 169 usable responses. The bulletin states that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the most commonly noted aims are those that focus on the benefit of PRP to the workforce in terms of reward or simply tax relief".</p></blockquote>
I understand that that was not the original aim. It seems to confirm one of our concerns that the measure would be used by companies as a means of avoiding paying tax that they would otherwise have had to pay. The bulletin continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Profit-related pay has been adapted by employers … and … changes in the legislation in the past two years have done little to damage its perceived flexibility … Half of all respondents preparing or running schemes have used the legislation to gain tax relief for payments from an existing profit-sharing bonus or to launch a new bonus arrangement. Just over a quarter have replaced a predetermined portion of each employee's basic pay with an element of PRP, so that even if the profit-related pay generated does no more than replace the salary foregone, employees experience a net increase in pay because the payment is made free of tax. Another one in five organisations has substituted PRP payout for an annual pay increase."</p></blockquote>
In other words, it is being used by some employers as a means of avoiding paying basic increases every year. The Minister must respond as it seems that the taxpayer is again subsidising the employer. The employer is not meeting his obligations to his work force to ensure that it is being rewarded from the profits that the company is making. If the pay is profit-related, the company must be making profits and it should be taking into account the recompense that should be made to the employer from that profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>578</span>
Some employers are using the scheme to avoid their responsibilities by ensuring that they receive tax exemption. Therefore, the taxpayer is ending up paying for the increased performance of the company and is receiving a due reward. That was not the intention of the scheme, nor is it what was meant by the initial flexibility of the scheme. What will the Minister do to ensure that employers do not use profit-related pay on that basis? In answer to what effect the changes in last year's Budget would have on the operation of their schemes, the respondents all said that it would have little effect on the popularity with employers of profit-related pay. 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hon. Members should pay courtesy to the Chair and allow me to listen to the speech of the hon. Lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to spread the word among all employers about the benefits of the scheme. Some employers have regarded it as a means of avoiding their responsibility properly to adjust wage rates in line with the profits of their companies. They have considered profit-related pay as a means of appearing to increase the pay of employees, while not actually increasing it. The taxpayer is making up the difference. That was not the initial intention of the scheme and we do not want it to be used in such a way. Will the Minister respond to that point?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At one level, the clause is fairly technical. It takes account of the change in the accounting treatment of extraordinary items. The Treasury's press release that was issued at the time of the Budget made clear what areas the Chancellor was about to take into account when he was proposing such changes. Will the Minister outline to the Committee what the effect of the changes will be in terms of loss of income to the Revenue? By how much will individuals benefit? Will those individuals be spread throughout a company or will they comprise those who are mainly concentrated at the top end?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the items affected by the proposed changes are profits or losses on the sale or termination of an operation, costs of a fundamental reorganisation or restructuring having a material effect on the nature and focus of the reporting entity's operation and profits or losses on the disposal of fixed assets, together with the tax effects of any of those items. The Government propose under the clause, as I understand it, that companies will be able to consider those areas and decide whether or not they contribute to their profits—and therefore whether or not they are taken into account when calculating PRP.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need more clarification of what the Financial Secretary considers to be the financial implications of the measures. Is he absolutely sure that they will not allow a further increase in tax avoidance and make less clear what is and what is not allowable and who will have discretion to decide whether or not items are treated as extraordinary?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is technical, but the principles involved are not. Considering the length of time that the scheme has been in operation and the fact that it was introduced specifically to deal with the number of redundancies during the recession, is not it time to consider its effectiveness, whether it is now costing the taxpayer far too much money and whether we should consider other ways of motivating the work force by enabling it to feel
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0833">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>579</span>
fully part of the overall pattern and success of the company? Of course, employees want to be in that position, and it is the responsibilty of the Government and employers to consider how they can ensure that employees feel fully part of the direction of the company and of ensuring that it is profitable and works well. Before we can be content that the scheme is working to achieve that aim, we need some serious answers from the Financial Secretary. I hope that he will begin to deal with the issue with some seriousness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Liddell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not take up too much time, but I want to echo some of my hon. Friend's concerns about the clause. There are certain fundamental problems with profit related pay that the clause has failed to address. That is regrettable because it means that the operation of the system will remain somewhat skewed and its true purpose will be negated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One key concern that has always existed about linking a proportion of an employee's remuneration directly to the profitability of the company is the virtual inability of individuals—especially those lower down the company—directly to affect the company's profitability. At senior level, it is possible to manipulate a company's performance through bad decisions even, perhaps, consciously and deliberately negatively to affect a company's performance. Individuals further down the chain of command are powerless to affect their remuneration, and therefore their tax relief, under the taxation provisions. The clause has failed to rectify that fundamental difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned that tax relief is prohibited for those who work in the public sector or in non-profit-making organisations. I leave a question mark over the motivational ability of profit-related pay, but a large sector of the working population are denied the opportunity of that motivation. I share my hon. Friend's concern that the relief costs £500 million for 2 million employees, which makes it an extremely expensive scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The operation of such a scheme means that there must be sectoral discrepancies as structural and frictional changes in the economy work their way through. Those macro-economic changes in the economy can affect the performance of a company in a way that the individual employee cannot rectify to enhance the company's performance. That raises issues of employee motivation and demotivation, because if the employee is to be motivated by an increase in the company's profitability leading to the possibility of tax relief, the other side of that coin must be the demotivation that results from the employee's inability to enhance the company's profitability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill should have dealt with the grey area of the linkage between profit-related pay and employees' efforts. It is not difficult to envisage a case where the managers of a company have ambitions for a management buy-out of the company, and there have been examples of managers manipulating company profitability to enable them to buy the company at a more favourable price. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>580</span>
individual employee may be adversely affected as a consequence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Financial Secretary tell us how the changes affecting profit or losses in the sale or termination of an operation would affect a management buy-out? How could the Revenue be reassured that there had been no manipulation of the company's profitability by management? Will he explain how the profits gained on disposal of a fixed asset will be passed on through PRP to tax relief for individual employees? Will he expand on the criteria that will be used to determine the destination of extraordinary items—in other words, whether they should be included? I found the technical detail of the clause impenetrable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible that extra effort on the part of the work force might have made a subsidiary part of a company a more attractive asset for sale. What guarantees are there that such efforts by employees will be reflected in PRP?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Specialists in personnel and human resource management claim that PRP is one of the most important developments affecting pay in the United Kingdom in recent years. There are occasions when I would question that, and I am unconvinced that sufficient safeguards exist to protect the lower scale employee from corporate manipulation such as I described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Personnel specialists have questioned the use of a financial incentive such as tax relief or bonus or profit-related option to enhance individual performance. The survey to which my hon. Friend the Member for Durham, North-West referred pointed out that only 13.6 per cent. of schemes had been introduced with employee motivation as the main criterion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend referred to a serious misuse of PRP to pass on to the Exchequer part of the pay bill of an employer. I recognise that if a company in my constituency were in difficulty, one way of safeguarding the employment of my constituents would be to allow the employer to pass on tax relief to make up the difference in staff wages. I understand why that would be an attractive option, but there is no guarantee that extremely profitable companies do not use the same tools to reduce their pay bills to enhance, for example, the share options of their directors, chairmen and chief executives. We must be mindful of the fact that the more junior employee has less protection in such matters than the more senior employee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious about some of the other matters raised by the Buck consultants report. Some foreign-owned companies have shied away from PRP, partly because the transfer arrangements that they used in their multinational accounting made it difficult for them to express adequately the profitability of any unit or plant. Nothing in the clause will rectify that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a matter of anxiety that the scheme is especially unattractive to foreign-owned companies. In my part of the world, we are conscious of the importance of inward investment. We are also conscious of the fact that many companies do not operate in a branch plant manner; they set their profitability across the divisions of the company, which might be transnational rather than within a particular profit framework. What are the Financial Secretary's views on that matter? Even United Kingdom companies might find it difficult to break down profit
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0834">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>581</span>
components. That inability might disadvantage their employees by affecting their PRP.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past week, we have seen the impact of currency movements on profitability. Both large and small companies are extremely vulnerable to such movements. There are no safeguards to protect those employees who are lower down the scale from such problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the great burst of hype about profit-related and performance-related pay in the 1980s, it was claimed that such schemes were a means of involving employees much more in the performance and destiny of their companies. I contend that such schemes do the opposite. PRP is no excuse for the proper involvement in the destiny of companies or employees at every level within them. That is the way to ensure the increased profitability of companies, rather than under this varied system of tax relief for some employees, especially as such employees have a limited ability to affect the performance of companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Sir George Young)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a helpful debate about profit-related pay. From the Government's point of view, the policy has been successful. When the Government introduced PRP, their primary goal was to promote the establishment of pay mechanisms in a number of companies that linked part of the pay of employees to the performance of the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can measure the success of the policy by the take-up. About 2 million employees are now in PRP schemes. About 8,000 companies have introduced PRP schemes. There were two objectives behind the policy. One was to promote an identity of interest between the employees of a company and the fortunes of a company. No one would object to that. Involving employees in the fortunes of a company is a goal of its own. There are other components of the policy, as the hon. Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell) suggested. The involvement of employees in decision making is not the only component, but it is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other objective, which hon. Lady mentioned, was to cope with the number of people employed in companies over the trade cycle. If a company's labour costs reduce automatically during a recession, the employer is not confronted with the option of reducing the number of people who work for him to reduce his labour costs. Because firms covered by PRP find that labour costs reduce automatically as their profits reduce, they are not confronted with the harsh option of reducing labour costs by cutting their work forces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the two broad objectives of the policy. The cost is about £500 million, which is linked to the take-up. The fact that the cost is high does not mean that there have been no associated benefits or that the policy has not been cost effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What do we know about the impact of the scheme? As to the first objective—promoting an identity of interest between the employees and the fortunes of the company—most available studies of profit-sharing schemes support the view that the schemes increase employee involvement and that they are associated with modest increases in productivity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The information about the other objective—the impact of PRP on pay flexibility and employment—is less conclusive. That is partly because in the complex and
	<span class='label label-info column'>582</span>
varied world of commerce it is sometimes difficult to establish any clear relationships between cause and effect. It was always expected that the benefits associated with that part of the policy would be more apparent in the longer term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have commissioned an independent survey of employer attitudes to PRP. We hope to publish the findings soon. There may then be scope for further econometric work on that aspect of the policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Monklands, East mentioned that the scheme did not extend to the public sector. As the public sector does not make a profit, one cannot have a profit-related scheme in the public sector, but one can have performance-related pay, which increasingly plays a part in that sector. That is not affected by the clause, which specifically relates to profit-related pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that this is going to be a light-hearted intervention, but I give way to the hon. Lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It took me a minute to collect my thoughts, but the Financial Secretary announced that he had commissioned an employers' survey of attitudes to PRP. I wondered whether that was entirely appropriate, as the purpose of PRP is to encourage employees. If, as Labour Members suspect, the system is being used by employers to avoid paying tax and therefore depress pay, would it not be more interesting to have a survey—on which we could do that wonderful econometric work—that examined employees' attitudes? I wonder through you, Mr. Winterton, whether the Financial Secretary has any plans to commission such a survey.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before I call the Financial Secretary to respond to that, I shall say that I am delighted that the hon. Member for Barking (Ms Hodge) addressed her intervention through me. I have a view, but I am not permitted to express it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Member for Barking realises that PRP can be introduced only if it covers 80 per cent. of the employees. One cannot have PRP focused on the top tier only of employees, so one of the implications of her question falls away—the scheme must embrace the vast majority of the work force. [HON. MEMBERS: "NO it does not".] Schemes must apply to 80 per cent. of all employees in business or part of a business on similar terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some companies which employ only one or two employees are part of the scheme. That is the inequality of the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I have correctly understood the hon. Gentleman's point. Is he saying that there are companies that have only one or two employees? As I said, the Inland Revenue might express some interest if the schemes are being misapplied. The schemes need Inland Revenue approval, and the rules set out the parameters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another parameter, which is relevant to the intervention of the hon. Member for Barking, concerns
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0835">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>583</span>
the low limits on the maximum amount of tax-free PRP that an employee can receive in any year—£4,000. That gives a benefit to a basic rate taxpayer of £1,000 and £1,600 to a higher-rate taxpayer. We are talking not about the stratosphere of tax avoidance schemes but about a scheme that has focused on the bulk of employees. The tax advantage is relatively constrained by the maximum limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of abuse was raised. We have no evidence to suggest that there is abuse. If hon. Members have such evidence, we should like to see it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sutcliffe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a matter of interest, the "Tax Planners Newsletter" says;
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have clients who have schemes with only one member. That I would think is marginal even where the member is receiving the maximum payout."</p></blockquote>
There are abuses of the scheme; I shall let the Minister have details later. I hope that he will look into them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will take out a subscription to whatever publication the hon. Gentleman has if it contains information of relevance to the Inland Revenue about the collection of money due to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the more general point about the scope for abuse, the operation of the relief is kept under regular review. Inevitably, attempts will be made to guarantee amounts of PRP paid under tax exempt-schemes, but that would negate the purpose of the relief. When deliberate exploitation comes to light, the Government do not hesitate to act. Thus, two pieces of anti-avoidance legislation were to be found in last year's Budget and Finance Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Durham, North-West asked for more detailed information. I think it best if she tables a written question, which I will be happy to answer, about the distribution of PRP schemes among industry groups. I could give her the information now, but it would be tedious. I do not imply that anything else that I may have said is not tedious, but the information is best encapsulated in tabular form in the context of a written reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not have any information on the regional impact of PRP. We do not see PRP as an element in our regional policy. We do not have the information because tax is collected by tax offices and the figures cannot be broken down according to the distribution of a company's branches. For example, all the Marks and Spencer tax records are allocated to the company's registered office in Baker Street, although Marks and Spencer employ staff throughout the country. We do not have information on the distribution of PRP by region. In any case, it is not used as part of a regional or industrial strategy. It is part of an industrial relations strategy—an employee involvement strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked more specifically about the clause. The clause is intended, as far as possible, to preserve what happens now. At the moment, companies are able to leave out of account certain unusual items when calculating PRP. For example, a disposal of an asset might throw up a big profit. The legislation gives an employer the discretion to leave that profit out of account. The

employer is also allowed to leave out of account one-off losses that would similarly benefit the employee. The accountancy profession has cut back on the scope of extraordinary items for general accounting purposes, so we can no longer use that definition when calculating PRP. The clause simply deletes "exceptional" and inserts "extraordinary". That may sound an odd way of going about it, but it preserves the employers' discretion to leave out of account certain one-off items when they identify those items that are more directly related to the efforts of its work force. It therefore causes minimum turbulence and has a minimum distributional impact within the firm. It preserves the status quo.

With the exception of the information about the breakdown by industrial category, I have responded to most of the issues. It has been a useful debate. We will keep the possibility of abuse under review. I hope that the Committee will agree to the clause standing part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked the Financial Secretary whether he would let me know the financial implications of the clause not standing part of the Bill. I found his initial response on the general issues quite extraordinary. He said, "This is what we wanted and this is what happens." Yet he also said that there was no evidence to back that up and that the Government were looking for evidence now. The evidence that I have seen is that the scheme does not meet the objectives set by the Government. It does not significantly promote an identity of interest between the employee and the company on the means by which the company will succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no evidence that the scheme meets the other objective—to reduce the number of redundancies. My experience of the past seven or eight years is that the scheme was far from meeting that objective. Simply to state an objective does not mean that the scheme meets it. The Financial Secretary has failed to convince me that the scheme plays any part in meeting the Government's objectives. Employees should be integrated fully into the company's ethos and share its determination to succeed. They should feel that they have an identity of interest with the company. Ways must be found to enable firms to prosper without sacrificing the work force. I know that you, Mr. Winterton, are not allowed to express an opinion, but I know also that elsewhere in the House you have made your concern clear about the numbers of skilled people in some industries who have lost their jobs. Ways must be found to keep those people employed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested but not surprised to hear the Financial Secretary say that the scheme was not part of the Government's regional policy. I and my hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) have said for many years that the Government's mainstream policies often undermine their regional policy. Much mainstream Government money is allocated in a way that undermines the Government's determination to have a regional policy that ensures that the regions which have suffered from economic and industrial decline are given support and assistance to help them recover. The Government cannot expect to spend so little on regional policy and still hope that their mainline policy will not have an additional effect. Of course mainline policies affect what goes on in the regions. It is interesting that the Government have not considered the impact that the large amount of money

	<span class='label label-info column'>585</span>
accruing through their substantial tax policy would have region by region.

I was far from content with the Financial Secretary's answers. I remain unconvinced that the Government are able to use the scheme to achieve its intended objectives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Lady asked about the consequences of not inserting the clause into the Bill. There would be no direct financial consequence, but there would be quite a lot of inconvenience. Without the clause, those who operate PRP would be obliged to use an out-of-date accounting system or language. The overall cost of PRP is some £500 million, but there are no financial implications associated with the change, which is being introduced simply to make it easier to operate PRP.

I hope that any readers of the debate will not conclude that the Labour party, were it to come to power, would abolish PRP—

I do not want to prolong the debate. The short answer to the hon.

The Charity Tax Reform Group welcomes the extension of existing provisions, but I want to find out whether the Government will review the relationships between charities and tax laws. Most people think that lotteries run by charities are exempt from taxation. We know from the representations that we receive on VAT,
	<span class='label label-info column'>586</span>
however, that that is not true. That causes charities enormous difficulties, especially now that they are expected to do much of the work being put out to tender by local authorities and, indeed, by central Government agencies.

I have been remiss—I have not declared my interests. I am a vice-president of NCH Action for Children and am on the council of Voluntary Service Overseas.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments seek to remove lotteries from the provision and are probing in nature. It is time that a proper review of the relationship between charities and tax law was carried out. That relationship is complicated. Most people would think that the running of a charity shop is tax exempt, but that is not so. Most charities have found ways of getting around that problem, however. They covenant the money so that it is exempt from tax, and profits are passed on to the charity in that way. That procedure is convoluted, however, and some charities are anxious that it looks like tax avoidance, even though that is legal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also look more seriously at the relationship between charities and lotteries. I know from the National Council of Voluntary Organisations that the national lottery is already having an effect on many charities. The public think that they are giving to charity by buying a lottery ticket. That is not really the case—they only give 5p in every pound. The lottery has had an effect on the annual door-to-door collections of the NCH. According to the National Council of Voluntary Organisations, many other charities have been affected, too. Their income therefore is going down, but the tax regime that applies to them remains complex. Rather than there being one clear rule that sets out their relationship to the tax regime, every single thing has to be exempted individually.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will be prepared to consider that problem. It is extraordinary that a private firm that wins a contract would be able to claim exemption from 17.5 per cent. VAT, while a charity that took up the same contract could not. It is things like that which leave charities feeling that they are caught in a tax regime that is not sympathetic to them.

I seek simply to probe the Minister on whether the Government are prepared to have a good look at the whole of tax law in relation to charities. That should have been done long since. Given all the changes in regard to fund-raising that charities are having to come to terms with, it would be an opportune time for the Government to announce such a review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Paymaster General (Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I come briefly out of retirement to invite the Committee to reject the amendments. I appreciate that they have been tabled in a probing spirit and I am happy to answer the general points that have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are illustrative of the general issue because they invite us to exempt from tax all charities' trading profits. We all know the good work that charities do and, in recognition of that, trading profits are indeed exempt where the trade is exercised in the course of carrying out a charity's primary purpose or where the work is carried out by the charity's beneficiaries. However, the amendment goes further and wants us to exempt all trading profits. That would be unfair to the rest of the trading and business community. The Federation of Small Businesses published a report last year which complained about what it saw as the tax privileges given to the charitable sector. The report pointed out that, for example, all charity shops enjoy an 80 per cent. business rate relief which is sometimes increased to 100 per cent. by local authorities. Charities are also exempted from capital gains tax. The hon. Member for Durham, Northwest mentioned the sale of goods in charity shops. I can confirm that relief is extended to goods given to the shop for resale but not—and I think quite rightly—to the sale of new goods, which are sold in direct competition with the normal retail shops next door.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have the most recent figures, which are for 1993–94. In overall terms, tax relief to charities is worth £1,450 million. That comprises £830 million direct tax relief, £420 million non-domestic rates relief and £200 million VAT relief. I think that we have got it about right. To extend the exemption to all trading profits would upset the playing field—to use that very overworked cliché—and would also probably get us into trouble with the European Union obligations on trade and competition. However, if a charity wishes to trade, the best way that it can do so—and one which has the full encouragement of the Charity Commission—is to carry out trading through a trading subsidiary, formed specifically for that purpose. That subsidiary company can covenant its profits to the parent charity and that has considerable advantages; it brings tax relief and it also ensures that the risky business of trading cannot put the charitable status or assets of the parent charity at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether I am trespassing on the clause stand part debate, Mr. Winterton, but with your permission, as it flows so naturally from the amendments, I shall deal with the object of the clause, which is to
	<span class='label label-info column'>588</span>
extend tax relief to certain lotteries that are run by charities in their trading companies. It was previously thought that by using the mechanism of a trading company that covenanted profits, the profit of the lotteries would thereby be relieved of tax. However, the advice that we have received is that that is not the case and that, unless we pass the clause, tax could be leviable on the parent charity. That is the underlying purpose of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The group of amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Durham, North-West contains amendments Nos. 261 and 262, although she did not mention them. I must resist those amendments simply on the grounds that they are unnecessary because we have already exempted from tax by concession all the profits in question from 11 July 1994. That announcement was made by my predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Sir J. Cope) and a press release was issued at the time. The purpose of the amendment is to make the start date Budget day last year, which would be unfavourable to the charities involved. In statute, the tax relief is to run from 6 April this year, to coincide with the financial year. I emphasise that in practice the tax relief will run from 11 July 1994 when the initial announcement was made.
