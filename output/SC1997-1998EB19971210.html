	<section>

	<div class='legislation'>Agenda 2000: The New Financial Framework</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a pont of order, Mr. Atkinson. We have previously had difficulties with documents for this Committee, and I regret that I was able to look at the documents for the first time only late last night, when I discovered that the explanatory memorandum—a most important document—had been miscopied, so that paragraphs 13 to 19 are missing. They are key paragraphs relating to the policy and financial implications. I was fortunate enough to obtain another copy this morning, but I imagine that other hon. Members have had the same problem with the miscopied paragraphs, which makes it difficult to appraise properly the Government's response to the Community document. I should like to express the Opposition's concern about the continuing absence of proper and timely documentation for these Committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Helen Liddell)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I am very sorry that this has happened. There always seems to be a problem with papers for these Committees, and all hon. Members have an interest in trying to improve the system. These gremlins creep in because of the volume of papers, but I do not underestimate the inconvenience that has been caused to hon. Members. I understand that the relevant paragraphs are being photocopied as I speak, and will be available to the Committee in a few minutes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I call the Minister to make her opening statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.31 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I read the Scrutiny Committee's report, which concluded that Agenda 2000 was of "considerable political significance", I felt that someone had become a master of understatement. It is one of the key issues that we have to address, as we come to the closing years of the 20th Century and look back on its history. In Agenda 2000 we are considering a significant change that will embrace a number of countries that have spent much of the century cut off from the rest of Europe, because of the political system that operated within them. The European Union is embarking on the most complex set of parallel negotiations in its history, including economic and monetary union, and Agenda 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
The Government wholeheartedly support the broad themes of the Agenda 2000 communication: the eastward enlargement of the Union; the reform of the common agricultural policy and the structural funds; and continued attention to budgetary rigour. In the broadest terms, many hon. Members on both sides of the Committee would be able to find common ground for agreement on these points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I should make it clear that the Government do not agree with all the Commission's proposals. The Government are fairly closely aligned with the Commission on the priorities for enlargement, but we think that the proposals for CAP reform are much too modest. We are also concerned about some of the proposals for the structural funds. The Committee will not be surprised to hear me say that the Commission could have been even more rigourous in its financial approach. Hon. Members should not expect me to defend every detail of the Commission's ideas, but the Government recognise that they are a helpful starting point for discussion— nothing more. As the Americans say, there is a way to go on these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matters that we are discussing today will be under discussion at the Luxembourg European Council, which opens on Friday of this week. They will continue to be a priority during the United Kingdom's presidency. Our discussion of these matters, in the runup to the Luxembourg Council, is most timely. I ask the Committee to understand, however, that I do not wish to prejudice the Government's negotiating position in the proceedings of the Council. For that reason, I apologise if I cannot give full answers to some questions. When I think that I am constrained by our negotiating position in the discussions at the weekend, I will make that clear in my replies. I hope that there is no suggestion that I am hiding behind the negotiations as a means of evading questions that I cannot or will not answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the three proposals in this June's Agenda 2000 communication, without doubt the most exciting is that on European Union enlargement. The Government firmly take the view that additional members should be able to join the Union as soon as it and they are ready. It is exceptional that such a unifying process is envisaged after the seemingly irreconcilable divisions of a few years ago. I understand that there will be a full scrutiny hearing on all the enlargement issues in the new year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to understand the significance that the Government attach to the reform of the EU's policies as part of the requirement for successful enlargement. The Government are committed to striving for reform of the CAP, which currently has a nonsensical effect of the Union's economy and the Community's budget. Moreover, as the CAP accounts for about half of the Community's expenditure, reform would significantly aid the long-term financing of enlargement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reform of structural and cohesion funds is also necessary to direct spending where it is most needed and to maximise value for money. This Committee
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0244">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
reviewed the structural policy reform issues yesterday, and its sister Committee is today looking at the CAP aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom believes that policy reform must go hand in hand with budgetary discipline. The Government want to ensure that the ceiling on own resources of the Community remains at the current level throughout the coming enlargement process. To prepare for the period when the costs of enlargement peak, it is necessary to ensure that Community spending is set well below the current ceiling at the end of the next financial framework. It is essential that there is a clear working margin under the own resources ceiling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the presidency of the European Union, we expect the European Commission to publish more detailed proposals on the reform of CAP and structural funds, and on the future financial framework. The discussions at Luxembourg—and other meetings of the Council of Ministers—will influence those proposals; the United Kingdom's position will, in turn, be influenced by what is said today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even without the detailed proposals before us, it is clear that we are at the beginning of a very long process. We are unlikely to reach decisions on any of the policy reform or financial issues during the United Kingdom presidency—it might take another year to do that. However, I hope that we shall be able to set the process going with a strong impetus towards reform and efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are here to focus on future financing, so I remind the Committee of the three key points in the dossier for which the Government will be arguing in the coming months. First, we shall argue for the maintenance of the 1.27 per cent. own resources ceiling, which is mentioned in the motion I will move later; secondly, we shall argue for the restraint of Community spending on all fronts, so that it remains well below that ceiling; and thirdly, we shall argue for no change to the system of contributions, including our abatement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that there is a good deal of support for those propositions throughout the Committee and the House. However, there are many issues that we shall want to discuss in detail. It will be a lengthy process, but I hope that the replies I give today will elucidate some of the issues. If I am not able to elucidate any of the issues, I shall certainly ensure that members of the Committee receive full replies. I look forward to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we have until 11.30 am for questions to the Minister. I further remind the Committee that questions should be short and brief and asked one at a time, because all hon. Members will have ample opportunity to ask as many questions as they want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Economic Secretary for her helpful introduction and I invite her to confirm, in the spirit of her concluding remarks, that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Government's attitude to the own resources percentage ceiling—set at 1.27 per cent. of gross national product—should be viewed in the context of the prediction that there will be growth within the EU fifteen of 2.5 per cent. per annum. Giving evidence elsewhere, the hon. Lady tabled a useful sensitivity analysis of the results, stating how much headway would be left under the ceiling. Can she confirm, however, that the Government's attitude to the own resources ceiling is as robust as their attitude to the British rebate, which the hon. Lady memorably said was "set in stone"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his question, which allows me to clarify the Government's position. The Government have a firm commitment to the 1.27 per cent. own resources ceiling. We shall probably return later to the hon. Government's question about growth, which is important because there is an assumption of about 2.5 per cent. growth, which the Commission assumes will leave a margin of 0.05 per cent. Even a small downwards variation in the estimate could bring about a tightening of the margin. There should be the utmost rigour in ensuring that the margin of the financial perspective remains as wide as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confirm our clear commitment to retaining the 1.27 per cent. own resources ceiling. I should also like to make it clear that that should obtain throughout the enlargement period—and certainly for the period under consideration of 2000 to 2006. That would allow the ceiling to grow in line with economy, but we are not sympathetic to reviewing the ceiling within that period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend referred to agricultural spending and to the Government's disappointment at the Commission's view that spending on agriculture to 2006 will rise by the rate of inflation plus three quarters of GNP growth. That amounts to little basic change in agricultural spending. Will the Government challenge that view more fundamentally? How does the Commission's estimate square with the Government's wish for fundamental reform and a significant reduction in agricultural spending?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. The no change perspective is a starting point. My hon. Friend the Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, is currently sitting in a sister European Committee dealing with these matters. We are agreed that negotiations on enlargement must run in parallel with reform of the CAP and structural funds. Without significant reform of agricultural policy and an attempt to control agricultural spending, we will reduce the margins.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a question of priorities. The Government believe that expenditure of the European Union should be tuned to the needs of the people, which will require changes in overall patterns of spending. We want a financial perspective that will begin to wean Europe's farmers off their expensive subsidy habit—then we can have a realistic agricultural policy and secure the leeway to which I referred earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0245">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I come to a more detailed point about volume two of Agenda 2000. As the Economic Secretary noted, there is concern about the ability of applicant states to absorb resources. The annual report of the European Court of Auditors for 1996 and its special report 3/97 on PHARE and TACIS point out that the Commission's concentration on full commitment of annual resources to fill up the budget, combined with low absorption rates and an excessively wide range of programmes, has resulted in a disturbing statistic—38 per cent. of the advance payments are paid up but uncommitted to work even within the current, modest framework.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. The acquis for the transition period is aimed at ensuring not only adequate resources to prepare countries for accession, but structured advice and guidance to help applicant nations to prepare themselves. Those countries have a long way to go before they match not only the economic performance of the existing 15 member states, but their administrative structures and their ability to use Community resources properly and effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am mindful of the hon. Gentleman's point. The transition period is critical. Part of the process to determine acceptable applicant states relates to countries' ability to make progress during the period that the acquis covers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend share my anxiety that agricultural expenditure constitutes the only growth in the financial framework? Does she agree that the Commission documents display a complacent attitude? They claim:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The 1992 reform of the CAP has been highly successful."</p></blockquote>
In fact, it meant additional expenditure of 6 billion ecu. Can my hon. Friend assure the Committee that a position in which CAP expenditure increases while structural and cohesion fund expenditure remains, at best at a standstill, is not acceptable to the Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said at the beginning of my remarks that members of the Committee should not expect me to defend everything in the Commission documents. I share my hon. Friend's anxieties, which he has expressed on several occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not strictly true that agriculture constitutes the only growth. Growth has occurred elsewhere, but, in real terms, spending is spread between more states. I cannot stress too often the importance that we attach to reform of the CAP. It is vital for ensuring that enlargement works. If the CAP is not properly reformed, we jeopardise prospects for enlargement and exciting opportunities for British companies to gain access to greater markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have supporters in other member states. There are signs of an understanding of the difficulty, even in states that were hitherto implacably opposed to any changes in the CAP. The Committee is unanimous in wishing to secure reform of agricultural spending.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just one more question at this stage; it relates to the preamble to the first volume of documents. I was disturbed by a reference on page 13 to modernisation of the pension and health-care system. The document provides an analysis of aging in the Community, and the disproportion between retired people and those who are economically active. Can the Minister explain the reference on page 13 to "coordination of policies", and especially the phrase,
	<br><blockquote><p>"regulatory initiatives can provide a new common framework, in particular for pension funds in the euro financial area"?</p></blockquote>
Some of us are rather concerned about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue of pension funds has arisen on several occasions and we must bear in mind some significant points. Given that it is a complex matter which requires more detailed consideration than can be given in a brief exchange in a European Standing Committee, I undertake to write to the hon. Gentleman giving a full explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the questions asked by my hon. Friends the Members for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Stevenson) and for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins), I want to mention the political angle. It seems likely that after the Community expands, the lobby in favour of agricultural spending will grow significantly because of the nature of the economies of many of the new states. That, perhaps, is a reason to press enthusiastically for the reform of the CAP before the expansion takes place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept my hon. Friend's advice. There is a need now to press vigorously for that reform because, given the agricultural interests of an enlarged Community, we could create difficulties not just for ourselves but for all European member states. It is important, too, to recognise the case for reform of the CAP, which was designed for a regime in the 1950s. We are now trying to apply to it a regime in the closing days of this century and the early days of the next. The Committee's concentration on agricultural reform is very helpful. It will guide the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor, when they go to the European Council in Luxembourg, on the strength of feeling that exists on the subject—not just to be negative about agricultural expenditure, but to ensure that there is an agricultural policy that takes into account the real needs of member states and applicant states, rather than the establishment of a bureaucratic system which many member states have found counter-productive and which has caused grave concern to consumers and politicians alike.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In its justification for maintaining a margin below the own resource ceiling on page 80 of the first volume of the document, the Commission states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The integration of the applicant countries will not have been completed by the end of the next period. It would therefore be wise to leave some resources available to cover the end of the transitional arrangements".</p></blockquote>
When I read that, an alarm bell rang in my mind and I wondered whether, during the course of the negotiations about the transitional arrangements, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0246">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Commission is signalling that open-ended arrangements might be allowed to overrun the budgets that have been set. Can the Minister assure us that the United Kingdom will insist that the scope of the transitional arrangements negotiated is strictly within the cash budgets agreed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can certainly give the hon. Gentleman that assurance, because the sums involved are considerable—they go up to three billion ecu by the end of the transitional period. It is therefore important that we ensure that proper and finite operations are put in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of other states which, in the Commission's view, are not ready yet to pursue the route of enlargement. We must also ensure that the current over-concentration on the applicant states does not inhibit the prospects of future applicant states. If we were to give the sort of open-ended commitment—which I am not prepared to give—we might be storing up problems for the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend ensure that during debates about the new parliamentary framework, sound financial management is absolutely a part of discussions on tackling fraud? Will she also ensure that the challenge of enlargement will bring with it the challenge of ensuring that additional moneys are properly spent? The huge amounts of money under different budget headings in the documentation, and the monitoring of how it is spent, will be absolutely crucial if we are to maintain the confidence of the British people in what is happening in Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very good point. It is a matter not just of fraud, but of waste and mismanagement—there is probably more waste and mismanagement than specific instances of fraud. I visited the European Court of Auditors last week, which is beginning to feel slightly more positive about the attitude of the Commission and of member states to issues such as financial management. The same time scale that is being used for Agenda 2000 applies to the SEM 2000 arrangements to improve financial management in the Community. A point that I made in the budget negotiations concerned the Union's tendency sometimes to set expected expenditure levels that are way out of kilter with what could be spent in the relevant period. It is important, for sound financial management, that budgets should not be overestimates. Such problems can occur with the structural funds and that does not lead to sound planning or to focusing of programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has made several key points about employment expenditure, because of the Government's initiative in Europe on the matter of employment, and has pointed out that several programmes related to that issue require greater focusing. We also need to take advice about the experience of other member states concerning best practice and programmes that have and have not worked. That approach is preferable to simply
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
deciding that more money is required, as distinct from focusing the money on the aims for which it was intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A very large part of the objective of the common agricultural policy was to raise the income of people who worked on the land to a level comparable with that of people working in industry. How successful has that policy proved to be for the present member states? How has it helped to diminish the number of very small farms that formerly existed in continental Europe? What is likely to happen with regard to the very small, one-man, subsistence type of farming that goes on in much of eastern Europe?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I can give an off-the-cuff analysis of the disparities in wealth affecting agricultural workers in the Community. However, I take the hon. Gentleman's point that there is no point in an agriculture policy that benefits only those with wealth or who own the land, and not those who work the land. I shall ensure that any Treasury evidence about disparities is made available to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point about the different structure of agriculture in the applicant states is important. In the transition period it will be necessary to be mindful of its impact. While we should be concerned about ensuring that their agriculture can cope with the pressures of accession, we must also ensure that the United Kingdom farming community will not be significantly disadvantaged through skewing of resources in a particular direction. The negotiation will be complex. I am sure that European Standing Committee A, which is this morning discussing the reform of agriculture policy, will go into those matters in some detail. It is important that member states should not approach the issue with a closed mind. It will be important to give coherent examination to the pressures that will be exerted on agricultural expenditure in the lead up to enlargement and afterwards, to avoid a skewing against the best interests of existing member states, or disproportionate disadvantaging of the states that are currently applicants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend share my concern that the financial ceiling, particularly relating to the fourth resource—which is 1.27 per cent. of GNP—and the financial perspectives that have been laid down for each of the expenditure headings in the EU budget have come to be seen as targets and not, as originally intended, as a strict control on expenditure? Is she, like me, concerned that a philosophy now undoubtedly exists in the European Union, and can be discerned in the documents, that expenditure that is within the financial perspective or financial ceiling is by definition okay? Does she share my view that that train of thought, that philosophy, needs to be addressed with vigour in these negotiations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much share my hon. Friend's view. While I am not complacent about the attitude of other member states, it was obvious at the recent Budget Council negotiations that there is a growing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0247">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
recognition across member states of the need to get away from the idea that, because the ceiling is 1.26 per cent. or 1.27 per cent., we have to hit it. That is why the margin between the financial perspectives and the own resources ceiling is crucial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That echoes the point that I made in response to the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell): so much else hinges on making sure that we have the margins available that allow the costs of enlargement without a disproportionate impact on the existing member states. That came true during the budget negotiations when the Budget Council was able to agree to budget that was considerably less than the Commission had proposed and substantially less than the Parliament had started out seeking in the negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to ensure that there is common sense in relation to that margin, we must constantly press that point. We must get it into perspective. There will be some blips in the growth between now and accession. There are some increases in the overall budget and in some projected parts of the overall budget. Our interest must be to ensure that once enlargement becomes a reality, the existing member states are not adversely affected. There will be some costs related to enlargement, but there will be benefits as well. We must make sure that we keep both of those in balance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the Committee that we are discussing the future financial framework. The document has been split into three parts and the part relating to CAP and the fall in agriculture is being dealt with by our sister Committee. That is not to say that hon. Members cannot touch upon it, but I hope that we do not major on it; the Economic Secretary is doing very well on agriculture but she is not an Agriculture Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Continuing on the theme of enlargement, could the Economic Secretary tell us what assumptions regarding the transition on introduction of the own resources payments from the new members have been made in preparing these budget figures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not too clear about the hon. Gentleman's question. May I ask him to expand?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should have said that it is my understanding that when Spain and Portugal acceded to the Community, there was a long period in which their contributions to the own resources financing of the Community were tapered so that the impact did not hit all at once. I have assumed that that will be the case for the new members from eastern Europe. Can the hon. Lady tell us what assumptions the Commission made in preparing this framework about the period of that transition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his clarification, and now that my memory has caught up with me I can tell him that there are no Commission proposals on that matter as yet. It is something that will have to be raised during the accession negotiations because getting that correct will be absolutely critical. I understand that the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Gentleman was really asking about the assumptions rather than the proposals. I am not clear about the answer to that, but I will certainly write to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mention is made in the explanatory document about the fact that the UK is relatively less prosperous than some other countries which are net recipients from the Community budget. I would not ask my hon. Friend to reveal her negotiating tactics on that point, but is there any hope that that is going to be addressed in the near future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an interesting point at present that the issue of abatements consumes other member states, too. Let me take this opportunity to state yet again, very clearly, that there is no question of changing our position on the abatement. I realise that some other member states now recognise the scope of their net contribution and are concerned. I can appreciate that, but I have to go back to the point that I made at the beginning—the real importance of making sure that policy reform goes ahead at the same time as enlargement. Some of the member states that are now concerned about their net contribution in relation to their overall prosperity are those that have been resisting policy reform, particularly on the CAP. There is no question of Britain being prepared to agree to any change in the abatement system, even after accession of the applicant states. We will still be among the countries that are less prosperous in relation to the expenditure that we are making, so we take a very hard line on that while recognising that other countries have problems and difficulties too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following on the general line of questioning from my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) the Economic Secretary will be aware that the document contains a stipulation that the newly acceding members should accede to the second stage of economic and monetary union. She will also be aware of the figure of 45 billion ecu which is allocated to the cohesion and structural funds in respect of those acceding members over the period. On a rough calculation of their population and the number of years involved that comes to £50 per head per annum of transitional relief. Could she enlighten us, in a way that exceeded the brief of the Minister who appeared before this Committee yesterday, and tell us how she sees these two things working together? Do the Government feel that enlargement will be feasible under circumstances where the newly acceding members have to come into the second stage of EMU, which they do not believe Britain is yet ready for, but will have only £50 per head per year to ease the transitional effects of that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for asking about that as I was aware that it was raised yesterday. There is some misunderstanding about what the communication says, so it may help the Committee if I take some time to go over it. It states that enlargement is expected to take place in stage three of economic and monetary union. That is a statement of fact. It adds that all member states must
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0248">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
endorse the aim of EMU and thus should be able to participate in time in the Euro-area, and that while it is unlikely that at the time of their entry the new member states would be in a position to participate fully in the Euro-area, the major challenge for them will not be to enter the Euro-area but to adopt the Community acquis in the area of EMU even as non-participating countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is therefore not as clear cut as the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) described. He suggested that there was a requirement for the new member states to join the second stage of EMU immediately upon accession. I understand that yesterday he also referred to the exchange rate mechanism and the requirements on member states in relation to that. Member states do not either now, or after enlargement, need to join the ERM or what has come to be known as ERM2. Entry into both ERM and ERM2, which will replace ERM on 1 January 1999, is entirely voluntary. That was reaffirmed in the conclusions of the European Council at Florence in June 1996 and in the European Council resolution agreeing the new ERM at Amsterdam in 1997. ERM and ERM2 are not treaty arrangements; they are established by intergovernmental agreement. I do not know whether I have addressed the hon. Gentleman's main point. If he wishes to come back, I will willingly try again, and if he is still not clear I will return to it in my wind-up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is very kind. Her answer addresses the point. I may be in error here. This is not a matter of political controversy, but of whether the Commission is doing something to which both the Government and the Official Opposition would object. I should like to draw her attention to page 49 of the document. Incidentally, when we checked the French text of another phrase which we believed read one way, we discovered that it read another way. We were wrong yesterday about another point. The translation here may be misleading too, and I admit that I have not checked the French text. However, in the third paragraph of page 49 of the Commission document, the English text specifically states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"new member states will have to adopt the acquis of Stage 2 of EMU. This implies central bank independence, coordination of economic policies"</p></blockquote>
and so on. It adds:
	<br><blockquote><p>"They shall have completed the liberalisation of capital movements. Also, they are expected to participate in an exchange rate mechanism and avoid excessive exchange rate changes."</p></blockquote>
I have to admit that the wording may be ambiguous, but it does look as though the Commission's intention—which is not the Government's position— is to force the new member states into ERM or ERM2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can see how the paragraph could be read in that way. However, it is clearly not the intention to force those countries in any particular direction. For a start, those countries are going through a period of significant transition, so the
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
likelihood of them being in a state of preparedness is remote. Let us consider the text again. The final sentence of the third paragraph states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Also, they are expected to participate in an exchange rate mechanism".</p></blockquote>
That does not place them under a legal obligation. If the Commission takes the view that it should be an obligation, the United Kingdom Government will disagree with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under previous Conservative Governments, there was a tendency to regard all European Union spending as either a necessary or an unnecessary evil. I hope that this Government take a more selective view. Does my hon. Friend agree that certain aspects of the proposals show a welcome shift of emphasis? In particular, the objective 3 proposal accords very much with the approach being taken in this country to lifelong learning and to the education of the unemployed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an apposite point, given the Government's concerns about employment and the flexibility of employment across Europe. It is related to lifelong learning and to skilling people so that they have the flexibility to enhance their employment opportunities. The Government believe that there should be a requirement to focus expenditure much more efficiently, rather than to increase it. The existing margin between Community expenditure and the own resources ceiling still provides considerable leeway for additional expenditure. However, during our presidency we shall emphasise the importance of financial management and we shall stress the need to target money properly on programmes that are seen to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is right to stress the change of emphasis. Indeed, that theme will run throughout the United Kingdom's presidency. We do not want Europe to be just a subject of discussion for the chattering classes; we want it to be something that is relevant to people's needs, to their daily lives and to their experience of employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reference to the United Kingdom's abatement, the Commission suggests that average living standards and relative prosperity in Britain will remain below the EU average by 2006, which is even after the accession of a number of poorer countries that will bring down the average level of prosperity. The extent of the average fall will not be great because the populations of those countries are not great and their population weighting will not be significant. Nevertheless, the United Kingdom's living standards will be below the average by 2006. If we do not do something about that, does it not suggest that we might allow ourselves to grow rather more slowly than we would have hoped?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do not this Government want to promote faster growth in Britain than was achieved by the Conservative party during the past 18 years? During that time we fell behind Italy and Ireland, and possibly other countries. In spite of Nigel Lawson's alleged economic miracle, the benefits of north sea oil and other events, we still had slow growth. Will my hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0249">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Friend point out to the Commission that the Labour Government intend to have faster growth and to climb up the EU ladder of prosperity?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend would not expect me to point that out to the Commission if I was arguing about the abatement at the time. He makes a key point, however, about the prospects for growth in the United Kingdom. We believe that, at accession, we will still have a way to go in terms of our prosperity related to that of other member states. We are the fifth largest contributor, which is a source of great anxiety to the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With reference to the broader economic points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins), the Government's economic intentions are to move away from quick spurts of growth and to encourage a rise in longer-term trend growth, so that we do not boom and bust. For that reason, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has introduced changes in the operation of monetary policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the long term, therefore, we seek sustainable economic growth, but we must not confuse that policy with the assumptions of the Agenda 2000 communication. Although it makes an assumption about Europe-wide growth in the 15 states, there is no specific assumption for the United Kingdom or for other member states. Indeed, none is needed. The growth patterns of individual member states do not need to be taken into account. None the less, I repeat my earlier caveat that the Government are not wholly convinced that the 2.5 per cent. cross-European figure is the correct one. It seems to be at the upper end of the range, but if the Commission has made an error, and European growth will be lower, the estimated 0-05 per cent. margin between the financial perspective and the own resources ceiling could seriously damage the prospects for sound enlargement. The Government wish to ensure that the margins can take into account any possible errors in the growth projections contained in the document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly expressed in the report is the hope that there will be some leeway in expenditure at the end of, or during, the period. If any money does become available from the reform of CAP, or from other programmes, what are the Government's priorities for its expenditure, and are those priorities shared by other member states?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That matter will be discussed at the Luxembourg Council, as it was discussed at the previous European Council. The British Government have made it clear that one of our priorities for Europe is employment. We want to ensure that the European Union's resources are used to boost employment. Eighteen million people across Europe are unemployed. If we can reduce the number, we will not only change opportunities for individuals, we will improve efficiency for the economies of individual states because unemployment is a wasted resource. We want Community resources to be channelled to improve employment across the member states. We
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
also want those resources to be more specifically focused on programmes, rather than the current situation in which it is assumed that a certain amount will be needed for a project, and there is often a significant underspend. That happens regularly in the case of structural funds, and it is not good financial management. It also means that taxpayers' hard-earned cash is not adequately directed towards expenditure on projects that will have real benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are enthusiastic about enlargement, from which we seek opportunities for British business. However, we must bear in mind that those who will be affected by enlargement are the ordinary men and women in the member states, many of whose lives are blighted by unemployment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Twigg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was heartened by my hon. Friend's comments and by her clear focus on waste and inefficiency. In what way is she working with like-minded states to introduce more budget discipline to root out waste?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My recent discussions with the European Court of Auditors reveals that several member states share Britain's view. As I look round the table at the Council of Ministers, in the Budget Council and at ECOFIN, I see that the majority of member states recognise that there must be close attention to financial management and to waste. Sometimes we argue about the definition of waste and of financial mismanagement, but as member states come to recognise the importance of budgetary rigour, there is an improvement. To give due credit to the Commission, it now takes a harder line on waste and mismanagement and on cross-border fraud and fraud in the use of community resources. Commissioners Gradin and Liikanen have concentrated on those matters and they know that they can rely on the support of the United Kingdom Government. There is a much more positive attitude now, but we must ensure that it does not slip.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to a point made earlier in our discussion on enlargement, it is important that, through organisations such as the European Court of Auditors and other Community institutions, advice and guidance is given to the applicant states to ensure that they have financial tracking procedures that allow them properly to use European resources and to give all of us comfort and resources are not mismanaged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Cable</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister share my concern about what appears to be a projected decline in the structural funds available to the Community fifteen in the context of monetary union? We share the Government's objective that monetary union is desirable and that we should be part of it. We will be part of it, certainly by 2005–2006, but we share the fear that there will be stresses and strains within the European Union and that a financing mechanism will be needed to cope with them. Is not the decline in structural funding a retrograde step in that context?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman wants to explore a number of matters that I understand were fully discussed yesterday when the Committee examined the structural funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom has a specific interest in the future of the structural funds. I must disabuse the hon. Gentleman of his notion that structural funds are a means of fiscal transfer within EMU—they are not. The purpose of the structural funds is specific. Many parts of the United Kingdom benefit from structural funds, but we pay quite a lot of money for it. For every £1.50 that we spend on structural funds, we get only £1 back. The hon. Gentleman, of all people, will know that there is an opportunity cost in that expenditure in that there is less money available for domestic regional expenditure. It is clear that we must be very concerned about the growth of structural funds and I am conscious that many local authorities are anxious about their future. It is important to bear in mind that structural and cohesion fund expenditure in the 15 existing member states is still likely to be higher in 2006 than it has been in recent years. The structural funds have recently grown very fast; there have been two successive doublings over the last two periods. We must ensure that structural fund expenditure enhances our own regional domestic expenditure and, of course, this Government have far-ranging plans for reform, not just of the constitution but of regional development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take on board the hon. Gentleman's concern about structural funds, but he must not confuse it with fiscal operations after monetary union. He must also not assume that there are simple answers about the future of structural funds, not only now, but after applicant states' accession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to bring my hon. Friend back to the exchange rate mechanism and monetary union. I am delighted that the hon. Member for West Dorset acknowledged the difference between the French and English texts, and that Conservative attempts yesterday to suggest that member states would be forced into EMU were incorrect. Labour Members were all working from the original French text, and, therefore, were unable to understand what Conservative Members were talking about yesterday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The text states that the new EU states will be expected to join an exchange rate mechanism. Currency stability and a long-term objective of joining EMU is desirable.Can my hon. Friend confirm that states are not expected to join EMU immediately on accession, but that joining is a long-term objective?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's point about currency stability is important for existing member states as well as for applicant states. My hon. Friend mentioned, in a joking manner, yesterday's discussion and the interpretation of the document. However, I reiterate that there is no obligation on member states to join ERM. Joining is voluntary and any state that wishes to join must obtain the agreement of other member states. Member states must decide for themselves what would provide stability in their currencies and exchange rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
It is important to acknowledge the period of transition that applicant states are about to undergo, and are already experiencing. They have come a long way since the fall of communism. Some have grown far more quickly than others. Clearly, those countries will have to consider how they trade with countries that are part of EMU, as well as with the wider world. However, it is a matter for individual member states. Heads of Government will also have an interest in the matter. We would oppose any structure that placed an obligation on member states to join ERM.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am under a slight disadvantage. I want to draw the Minister's attention to the strength of the Commission's position by referring to the French text. However, I am not allowed to quote in French. My question does not relate to the ambiguity in the English text that we resolved wrongly. That involved the third stage. My question is about the second stage. It is exactly the same question that was posed a moment ago, and it relates to an item on page 49.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that instance, the French text is stronger than the English text. It states what can only be translated as, "they must also participate in the exchange rate mechanism". Earlier, it claims, rudely, that states will be "obliged" to adhere to relevant provisions of the stability pact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Minister's assurance that the Government will object to what the Commission is trying to insert into Agenda 2000. Can she assure us that the Government will take up the matter with the Commission to ensure that the document finally approved as Agenda 2000 does not contain such language?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for drawing the matter to my attention. I apologise for not reading the document in the original French; it was difficult enough to find time to read the stuff in English. Someone who is bilingual, but who is not officially in the Room, told me that the words at issue, which I cannot quote, reflect a strong sense of moral obligation. The simplest solution to the problem would be for me to undertake to examine both the French and English texts and to speak to the hon.

	<p>11.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary has already referred to the Select Committee report, which concluded that the document starts to draw up the battle lines for what will obviously be long and difficult negotiations. We all proceed on that basis. Our aim in this Committee is to scrutinise the documents, generally support the Government in those long and difficult negotiations and, when necessary and appropriate, stiffen their resolve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should agree two points at the outset. We accept the first principle of the need for the Community to have a financial framework document. Like its predecessor, this document runs for six years. Although there are obviously difficulties because we do not even know the timing of the accession of the first central and eastern European states to the Community, it is a reasonable framework, which should be considered and, if necessary, amended. I endorse the Economic Secretary's remarks that she does not regard the document or the budget as a substitute for the pursuit of a number of policy reforms. We have to start with something, and the document is a sensible start. The Commission is to be commended for broadly setting out the issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point of agreement relates to the Economic Secretary's political comments, which I shall endorse with my own. There is a need for enlargement, which involves the joining together of Europe. Some Conservative Members had a strong commitment to the affairs of central and eastern Europe before the changes that took place in 1989. We took a great interest in those countries. Those of us who have continued to follow what is happening in them are aware of the problems that they face. We wish to welcome them home to a common European heritage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not appropriate for me to comment in this debate on the exact modes of enlargement negotiations—five plus one and so forth. We shall have other debates on that. However, we are indebted to my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset for illustrating the depths of the problems of convergence and the gap between the CEE10 and the existing EU fifteen, the national incomes of which also vary widely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That point has to be flagged up, because we must be leery of forced change when the gross national product of potential applicant countries is rarely above a third of the average among the EU fifteen. It is estimated that it will take 25 years for applicant countries to reach even half the EU level of GNP. My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset was right to express concerns about the dangers of forced convergence. Potential applicant countries need every available economic instrument, together with such transfers as we can reasonably make, to set about the great task of repairing the damage of what I might more controversially describe as 50 years of state socialism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to inject a note of controversy into the debate. The plain fact is that we want there to be a proper budget. As the motion makes clear, we want the budget to make enlargement feasible and to accommodate those countries. However, it is
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
necessary at this stage to set down markers. My starting point is the structure of the financial framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been said, in questions that I and other hon. Members asked and in the Minister's responses, the whole budget is predicated on a certain growth rate. That is 2.5 per cent., somewhat above the current strike rate in the EU fifteen, and somewhat above the Chancellor's revised estimate for the productive potential of the UK economy. If there is no growth, there will be no additional resources unless the ceiling is raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are genuine fears among some hon. Members that if, for example, as a result of monetary union, a continuing pattern of deflation were to emerge in the participating—perhaps 11—member states, there would be a danger that growth would not happen, which would create a problem for the whole Community, including the non-joining members. Secondly, external shocks, which we might find difficult to accommodate, like those that began recently in south-east Asia, would be possible. Although I do not anticipate that such factors will have a huge impact on United Kingdom domestic growth, they are nevertheless to be borne in mind. Slight concern has been expressed across the Committee that the structure of further provision for the structural funds is predicated on there being enough growth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem that could arise would be that the Community ran out of growth and therefore resources. It would be helpful if in her winding-up speech the Minister would reiterate the need to be extremely robust about the own resources percentage. As she knows, for reasons that we need not explore now, there has been a certain amount of what we might call creep in that respect in previous years. It is now set and we want it to remain as it is. The Minister has also spoken robustly about the need to retain the United Kingdom rebate, bearing in mind that the GNPs of applicant states that might enter are so small as to make no material difference to the pecking order of the EU fifteen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The so-called possibility of a fifth resource has not been much touched on this morning. I imagine that the Economic Secretary will want to fend that off. It seems to have no basis in principle and would, if anything, rather increase the disparity between GNP and overall contribution in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I felt that the Economic Secretary gave an uncharacteristically hasty reply to a point that I made during questions—although she conceded that she would write to me—and I want to reinforce my point. I am concerned about the reference to pension funds. The United Kingdom's tradition of free-standing pension funds is one on which we should like to build. The hon. Lady and I have debated various pensions matters in different contexts, but we share a commitment to that national asset, if I may call it that. The United Kingdom asset is of the order of £700 billion. Any suggestion, cloaked in the words that we are considering—and I have not referred to the French text, but perhaps the Economic Secretary should do
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0252">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
so—that there is to be a raid on our resources, would be extremely unwelcome. I do not think that a suggestion of a direct raid would be likely; I am talking more about an indirect, taking-into-account-in-the-budgetary-key type of raid. Such a suggestion should be vigorously resisted by the Government. I ask the Economic Secretary to say a little more on the political front in her response. We should welcome a letter clarifying the point in all relevant texts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a slightly more general context, in the analysis of the impact on existing members in the Agenda 2000 document, there is, from the Commission, a reference to—indeed, a frank concession of—the fact that additional pressure on the domestic budgets of the EU fifteen states will be inevitable as we run on, even beyond the framework period, and that that will need to be accommodated. For example, given their problems already in financing their current level of pensions and public expenditure, it is most important that those should both be acknowledged and not, to put it pointedly, solved at our expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Briefly, as I am mindful of your strictures, Mr. Atkinson, I should like to go on to two sectoral areas and to touch on the common agricultural policy. It must be the first time in history that I have allowed a debate to take place on these and related matters without referring to agriculture. Man and boy, over a period exceeding 30 years, I have concerned myself with the different evolutions of the CAP and its amazing propensity to come up surviving despite all the efforts that have been made to scotch it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no difficulty with the points that Labour Members have made about the need for reform. Of course, reform is needed. The Economic Secretary rightly flagged up that it needs to reflect both British national interest and has to be real reform in the sense that it tries to help and does not simply remove some budgetary items. The suggestion that we should be able to go ahead with an expansion, not only on the basis of inflation but at 74 per cent. of the incremental growth in GNP—I am not quite sure what principle there is to that—does not seem to constitute reform. The suggestion that we should look at all this and the guidelines again in 2005 seems extremely belated and all robustness in that area would be appreciated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In responding to the hon. Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins) I must make two other points. It is not now simply a matter of the internal procedures of the Community. Thank goodness that it is not because there is not just the direct implication of enlargement. Estimates vary, but it could well put up the CAP costs by something like 50 per cent. That is clearly unsustainable if all these countries came in. There are also the international obligations under the World Trade Organisation which clearly constrain, welcomely in my view, the growth of that major element in costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a sense, it is surprising that environmental expenditure has not been touched upon at all, particularly in relation to enlargement. Those of us
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
who know the countries concerned and have seen the problems of both air and water quality know how severe the position is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is touching on a point the full significance of which may otherwise not be appreciated. Does he agree that the Minister's remarks about the structural funds not being used to ease transition, which was well taken by the Opposition, relate closely to what he has just been saying? The structural funds may have to be used heavily to repair the environmental damage, leaving only the cohesion funds to solve transitional problems in those countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point. I will not follow him in it, but it is well made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally to conclude my point about the environment, it would be helpful if the Economic Secretary could tell us a little more about the likely commitment and its balance. There is some discussion in the document about the likely acceptance of the acquis, and the realistic transitional periods and balance of the financing between public and private. The inference is pretty strong that there would have to be a major element of private involvment in the process. We would welcome that. It might accelerate the necessary capital investment programme, but it needs consideration and support where appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Beyond that, the only area on which I would like the Minister to respond is on administrative savings. I strongly agree with the points made by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Stevenson) and others about the need not to take the Community budget for granted. It is easy to say that it is Europe's money that is being spent, but we should always remember—even those like myself who are natural and long-standing supporters of the European Union in general terms—that Europe does not have any money. It is the money of taxpayers like our own residents and citizens and we need to make sure, not just that it is restricted, which is what the framework is about, but that within that framework it is spent to best effect and does some good. For example, I am pleased about the contributions that have been made in education because I was involved in the negotiations on that matter. There is much leverage from relatively small Community expenditures that can generate many other good things. Each case must be considered on its merits, however, and no assumptions can be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Economic Secretary say a little more—at the global level, as it were—about the budgeting system in the Community and the checks and balances that will assure value for money? Will she give the Committee some information about the Community's accounting reforms; for example, whether it intends to move to a resource accounting structure? We would then be able to ensure that it uses its resources—the capital and the current items—to best effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue is that of fraud avoidance, or waste. We have had some helpful exchanges on that matter. As the document suggests, that is likely to be an interesting problem in the applicant countries. I do not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0253">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
say that sneeringly, but such countries do not have the deep infrastructure, nor the history of public propriety and compliance that generally applies in the EU fifteen—and even that varies, as we all know. We cannot just say, "Here is the money, go and get it, and spend it as you want." The money must be spent to best effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the Economic Secretary has been to see the European Court of Auditors. Hon. Members may remember that I referred to its report. The Court's work is based on the Maastricht treaty, negotiated by my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major). All members of the Committee will agree that we need to stamp out fraud; there has been too much of it, especially in the CAP, and we do not want it to be replicated in the applicant countries after enlargement. The Economic Secretary's comments on value for money and the avoidance of fraud will be helpful to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overall, the Opposition recognise the need for severe economy. We accept the Economic Secretary's response on that matter and we want to reinforce it. The explanatory memorandum is robust, and I welcome that, although some points might need filling in. If the Economic Secretary and her right hon. Friends proceed robustly, Conservative Members will back them. Will she reiterate the need to commit Her Majesty's Government to such an approach? The Government must look out for any details that may be inimical to British interests, but they should remember that the common interest is to secure value for money for the European taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. George Stevenson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make three points to my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary. Before I do so, I want to comment on the vexed issue of the Commission statement about states being required to join economic and monetary union. I do not believe that the Commission is entitled to put the statement in the documents for two reasons. The first is that the Commission is a policy initiator, not a policy maker, as my hon. Friend is aware. I am sure that she and her right hon. Friends will be robust on that issue. The second reason is that the Commission is unaccountable—I have held that opinion for many years. The Council has often been targeted for its unaccountability, but is the wrong target; it should be the Commission. I hope that my hon. Friend's robust attitude towards the inclusion of such statements in the documents will be strengthened by these comments. I return to my three points, the first of which relates to the financial framework and the ceilings which have already been referred to. I want to underline a point that I made in a question to my hon. Friend, to which she responded very positively. The evidence is irrefutable that, in a significant period since the financial perspectives were laid down, they have grown into targets. They are like a warm embrace and promote the attitude that if we keep within them they
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
will make us feel good, and say, "Well, as we are within that warm embrace, everything in the financial garden is lovely."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make that point as strongly as possible in this debate because such an attitude has developed from an obscure idea that someone in the Commission may have had in constituting a policy approach. The documents that we are discussing, and other Commission documents on the subject, are littered with references to the financial guidelines and the financial framework. I stand to be corrected, but in my experience, without exception, such references are on the following lines: "We think that the policy should go in this direction. We think that it will cost 'x', but it is within the financial guideline." We are therefore faced with financial frameworks and guidelines that have become established as policy targets and as justification for expenditure which many of us believe cannot be justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one considers the budgets presented in the present financial framework, taking into account that the financial ceilings and guidelines have always been respected and that there has always been a margin, one could argue that the financial guidelines are set too high. Although I do not expect my hon. Friend realistically to be able to take that on board in negotiation, I defy any Government and any Chancellor considering the budgets and seeing a consistent underspend on a particularly large area of expenditure over the years not to question whether the budget target in that area should be reviewed. I do not expect that my hon. Friend will be able to take that negotiating position because of the attitudes of other member states, but I reiterate that it is an important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point relates to common agricultural policy expenditure but not to CAP policy. I hope that you will accept that distinction, Mr. Aktinson. In the documents, we are somewhat beguiled by the Commission, in the sense that it is saying, "Well, look, we don't intend to alter the financial guidelines under the new financial framework for agriculture, and we don't intend to review it until 2005"—a point made by the hon. Member for Daventry, with which I agree. I also agree with him that that hardly constitutes a basis for fundamental reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the top of page 75 of the document on the new financial framework, the Commission proposes some detailed assessments of the financial impact. They are not generalisations; they specify amounts of money. Therefore, we should be careful. The document refers to keeping under 74 per cent. of GNP, and within the guidelines. The document states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"intervention measures and export refunds … following … reform"—</p></blockquote>
presumably sometime after 2005—should save 3.7 billion ecu in the new financial framework. That is fine, but there are two significant stings in the tail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next two paragraphs refer to additional expenditure of 7.7 billion ecu, further expenditure of 2.8 billion ecu, and additional on-going expenditure of 500 million ecu a year on an undefined agricultural project. We do not know where the expenditure ends,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0254">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
but a rough calculation reveals net additional expenditure of £8.8 billion on agriculture under the new financial framework—even without taking into account the annual 500 million ecu that the Commission proposes to spend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. I fear that matters are even worse than he suggests because the figure of 2.8 billion ecu in the third paragraph on page 75 is to be spent per annum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention. I was a Member of the European Parliament for 10 years, and I believed that I had got used to the Commission's approach. Obviously, I had not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's attitude to massive expenditure—50 per cent. of the budget—is complacent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It describes reforms under the current financial arrangements as highly successful. The previous Government allowed expenditure to increase by £6 billion over four years—not bad going for something that is supposed to be highly successful. The Commission describes benefits to the consumer, but does not mention the taxpayer. That is a significant omission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can we consider transferring resources from wasteful agricultural expenditure to employment, training and structural activity, which most hon. Members support, when the Commission proposes such a framework? The framework will not only maintain the status quo, but cost taxpayers in Britain and throughout the Community a great deal more. My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary was right to say that that was unacceptable, and that the Government's basic negotiating position is to press for fundamental reform, for its financial consequences to filter through in policy changes, and for policy direction that is consistent with the Government's objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A significant omission by the Commission in the document should be tackled: the relationship between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure. Compulsory expenditure is mostly agricultural expenditure. When regulations are made, the money must be spent; it is compulsory to provide the resources. What other legislature in the world would have such a system? It may have been justified some years ago, but it is no longer justified economically, financially or politically. Until we get to grips with that serious anomaly in the relationship between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure and until we do away with the concept of compulsory expenditure, we shall continue to be hide-bound in three significant ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the endless amount of money thrown at compulsory expenditure under the financial framework will continue to increase—if it is compulsory, there is no other way for it to go. Secondly, any policy initiatives seeking to transfer resources within the Community will be stifled. Such
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
initiatives cannot be achieved by law and that needs to be redressed. Thirdly, any radical and meaningful reform of the CAP and its expenditure will also be stifled, if not stopped dead in its tracks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put those points to my hon. Friend the Minister. I hope to strengthen her arm—and the arm of other Ministers—in the delicate and difficult negotiations ahead. I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to take my points into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Londonderry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I raised the point or order about the priority of texts, it should have been a point of information rather than a point of order. However, it was not a light point. Only yesterday in the House, we debated the priority of Welsh as opposed to English documents, which could have severe repercussions if both languages have the same standing law. That was not formerly so, but is now the case. The same issue arises with the texts and documents before us this morning. If the nuances and meanings are not exactly the same, different policies could be followed by the Governments of each country. In view of the experience of the Governments of other nations, we would expect the elastic to be stretched to the limit. It is important that whatever is brought into operation within the Community has exactly the same meaning in every member state. That is why the texts must be correct to convey exactly the same meaning to the legislators and citizens of all countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the Government's priority was employment. Yet so often in the Community, improving employment prospects has seemed to be a short-term fix for a cheap headline. Sometimes expenditure has been used to replace one job with another, which is not what the Minister—or indeed any Government—should be aiming for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Research and development is one key to the longterm, high-quality employment that this country and the rest of Europe needs. The Minister should seriously consider what policies and tax regimes the Government will follow and what similar action will be taken in the Community to promote research and development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the years, the Japanese have not been slow to develop emerging technology—often before it has emerged—by spending billions of pounds and then multiplying the profits as they increase their market share. In the modern world, that is not a quick process. Developing a project from its inception through to the marketplace extends over many years. Far too often, this country suffers from short termism, which tries to keep shareholders happy next year and the year after. It does not consider whether they will be happy in 10 years' time. Have the Government and the Community examined that problem? If they do not do so, we shall fall further behind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The car industry provides an example of that. Once we had a tremendous car industry, but now we do not own anything. The industry is in the hands of other people. It is all very well for the cars to be made in this country, but if no large-scale research and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0255">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
development on car manufacturing takes place here, we will become third-world assemblers for other people's ideas. That is not the way that the citizens of this country want us to go; it is certainly not the way that hon. Members want the economy to develop. That is the road to No-town. Foreign investors can pull out at any time and leave us sitting high and dry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will make the detection and prevention of fraud—especially fraud in the CAP—a high priority. I live in an agricultural community and have an agricultural background and it is my experience that the innocent soul who has made a mistake often finds that he has lost several thousand pounds a year. Last week, I took up two such cases with a Northern Ireland Minister. I think that there is good reason to treat those cases with flexibility, but I fear that there will be none. In the old days, when our own Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland was responsible for such expenditures, a far more sensible attitude was taken towards genuine mistakes than is currently the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be trying to stop large-scale, organised fraud rather than knifing the individual who has made a mistake. Do not forget, many people in the agricultural community do not have a high standard of education. Although the levels of education in agricultural communities, like elsewhere, are improving, those communities are made up of many elderly people who are confronted with form filling the like of which would drive a trained book keeper round the bend. They find it difficult to work such forms out, and then, all at once, they find that a large chunk of their net income has disappeared because they did not do something right. That is morally wrong. The subsidies are designed to help such people, but they do not find their way into their pockets. I hope that the Economic Secretary and her colleagues in the Treasury and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will keep that in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Due to my agricultural background, and despite your strictures, Mr. Atkinson, I would like to consider the agricultural implications of the documents. They tell us that farm income has been rising at 4.5 per cent. That figure must vary from one end of the Community to another. At the best of times, net farm incomes are exceedingly difficult to measure. At the end of the year, farmers assess how much they have made and then make up their minds whether they can afford a new machine. If they cannot, they do not buy it and that has repercussions all down the line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bovine spongiform encephalopathy crisis highlights the problems of farming. We all criticised the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the previous Government for the way in which the announcement of BSE was made two years ago. The present Minister experienced a similar hullabaloo last week, but what were Ministers to do? If they did not announce what was happening in the newpapers, they would have been crucified. They announced what was happening—too soon, as the farming community thought—and they were still crucified. They were in a no-win situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
People have lived through the experience of thalidomide, DDT and other insecticides. They were all portrayed as harmless, but, 20 years later, something dreadful happened. Therefore, the population is worried about such matters. Action was taken after scientific advice, so it was not the farmers or the Government who got it wrong. Scientists got it wrong and the people do not trust them any more. The scientific community must learn to live with that fact. I see you getting uneasy, Mr. Atkinson, but I have done my straying. Like a lost sheep, I am coming back to the straight and narrow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The result of the BSE affair is that beef farmers at least, and perhaps the farming community in general, are living on their capital. So, that is being eroded, which is not good in the long run. The Government can draw down funds for compensation and they have not done so. The situation is totally different for a country such as Ireland, which is a net beneficiary. We are a net contributor. Therefore, the costs are higher and there is a reluctance to go ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Beyond that immediate problem, in the long term, there will probably be lower world food stocks, according to the documents, which also mention future price movements. However, stocks will not be lower in Euroe. If we expand eastwards, our work force will double. The area will increase by 50 per cent. That will, of course, mean a lot more mouths to be fed by agriculture in eastern Europe than in western Europe. The farms are very small, as I mentioned in one of my questions. In Europe, we have the capacity to produce a huge amount of food that we cannot use. We will join Canada, the United States, Australia and New Zealand as countries with massive food surpluses in a world that is still largely short of food. Our food production costs are very high compared with other areas, not just because of the higher standard of living expected by the agricultural community and generally, but also because of thet standards of production on which we properly insist. People will be looking more and more for safe food. There are severe restrictions on the drugs, medicines and insecticides that can be used in agricultural production, and those restrictions vary from country to country. If we are to adhere to high quality standards, we must insist that our farmers in Europe are on a level playing field with respect to standards. The Minister will find that that is difficult to enforce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Enormous potential exists, but I feel that the prospects for upland farms and peripheral regions, for example, the place where I live, the north of Scotland, and the western islands, are not encouraging to the farming community. I should like to be told how the matter will be dealt with and so would the farming community.

Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South on a thoughtful speech, which means that I do not have to say many things that I would have said. He is far more knowledgable than I on such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The budget arrangements and the financial system are ill designed, and have been so from the beginning. They are particularly ill designed for Britain, which is why we must continue to have our abatement. They do not suit Britain; they do not suit the whole European Union either. The system is flawed and needs fundamental reform, not just the tinkering that has been suggested by the Commission. Something is wrong when richer countries are net recipients of the budget and poorer countries are net contributors to it. Enlargement and Agenda 2000 provide us with an opportunity to address such problems. There should be a correlation between prosperity and receipts or contributions; rich countries should pay more, and poor countries should perhaps receive more. There should be a redistributive element in the arrangements to help the countries of the Union to come together, rather than to move them apart.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman, but does he accept that the Commission's documents clearly state that the matter should not be viewed in that way?

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention and I accept his point, but I did not say that I agreed with the Commission. There are technicalities involved; it is not a matter of simple redistribution, of taxing the rich to give to the poor. There are particular programmes, notably agriculture, which distort the whole process. Agriculture has been mentioned several times, and it is a primary case for reform. The Government are committed to fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy and that is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the attractions of enlargement is that it will force a degree of reality into EU discussions about financial arrangements. The Commission lacks
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
realism in its views on enlargement. I hope that it is as serious about the matter as we are. I strongly support enlargement, and hope that others feel the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The applicant countries are considerably poorer than most of the existing members; they are much more committed to agriculture; they produce cheap food; and they will want access to the richer parts of the EU for their food products— is right. That will benefit them by helping their economies through exports. It will benefit consumers throughout the Community, who could see cheaper food prices. It will also help the EU's economic performance, because excessive subsidies to agriculture in the richer member states are a misappropriation of economic resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should ensure that the richer states receive more resources in areas such as industry and services, in which they perform well, leaving the production of food to those countries that can produce it more economically, without the need for excessive and vast subsidies. I do not suggest the total abolition of agricultural subsidies; even the richer countries will need some form of agricultural subsidy, but the present system is not a good one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be interested to know why the hon. Gentleman takes that view; he might be right. However, although some European agriculture, particularly in France and Germany, would find itself swept away, if progressive moves towards an entirely free market in agriculture occurred the prudent economics of the remainder might yield an interesting solution. For example, agriculture in my constituency might prefer to go without the slightest subsidy, as pig farming has done for many years. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that view?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I think that it would be politically disruptive to abolish a subsidy system altogether as some countries would have serious problems. Member states, and the EU as a whole, will want to sustain some agriculture for their own security. We cannot guarantee that there will not be a need for each member state to preserve some of its agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the second world war, this country could not properly feed itself. Much effort was put into making agriculture efficient and productive so that we could feed ourselves as best we could throughout the war. I was only three when the war ended, but I remember that we produced much of the food we ate. My mother was briefly a land girl; she did her bit in the war.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some form of agricultural subsidy is necessary. However, we have to reduce that budget and, within the limits we have set, shift spending to other programmes that are more economically beneficial to the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I questioned my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary earlier, I should have qualified my remarks and said that they were subject to our abatement being protected. Even if we went up the European Union's table of living standards, the distorting effect of the CAP and other factors would mean that we would still pay excessive amounts into the budget. We would be net payers to the budget and would still require the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0257">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
abatement. The fact that we require the abatement suggests that the system does not work very well and needs fundamental reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we can take the opportunity to challenge a system that has existed for nearly 50 years. It is outdated and needs change. I hope that our Government will live up to their commitment to seeking fundamental reform of the financial arrangements, particularly those for agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I look forward to faster growth, higher employment and rising prosperity in the United Kingdom. We may do rather better than the continental countries of Europe. We will not be constrained by the stability pact because of our sensible decision not to enter early economic and monetary union and the euro. There are strong qualifications attached to the United Kingdom's membership of EMU and the euro and the Chancellor of the Exchequer has spelt them out. That was sensible, and I emphasise his inclusion of employment among the qualifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For once, we have an opportunity to make progress. Instead of falling behind our European partners, we may grow faster and raise our relative prosperity level compared with other EU states. We must achieve substantial reform of the financial system and look sensibly at our economic arrangements within the European Union. I will not trespass beyond the subject for today's debate, even though I am sorely tempted to do so. The opportunity for fundamental reform must be taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Vincent Cable 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Twickenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I add my appreciation of the fact that the Commission has done its little bit for long termism by engaging in a 10-year planning exercise? In the same spirit as the hon. Member for Daventry, I support the Government's efforts to achieve value for money and a better deal for Britain within what the report describes as long and difficult negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make three points about the long-term figures. The first relates to what I said during Question Time. Elements of the Community budget should be welcomed. They are beneficial not just to Britain, but to Europe as a whole. One of my concerns about the way in which the long-term numbers play out is that some of the most valuable elements of the budget will be crowded out by others that are more questionable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I particularly draw attention to the structural fund in that regard. I know that it has been debated elsewhere, but an important issue is involved. As competition intensifies within the European Union—that will be one of the desirable consequences of monetary union—adjustment pressures will increase. There will be a greater need in vulnerable sectors and regions for compensating mechanisms and they will not be fiscal transfers, but the adjustment help that the structural fund will provide. That fact that the mechanism is designed to shrink in real terms is a matter for concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
My second point relates to the funding estimated for enlargement. Liberal Democrats welcome enlargement in principle and have argued for it for a long time. Britain's record in fighting for rapid and wide enlargement is generally honourable. However, elements in the budgetary provision worry me. First no account seems to have been taken of the damage that the European Union's trade restrictions have done to some of the applicant economies. Many of eastern Europe's structural problems occur in sectors such as agriculture, textiles and steel, in which anti-dumping duties result in high trade barriers. The necessity for structural funding is partly to cover a cash payment to placate interest groups in the European Union. Those groups should be made to accept market access as a more efficient and sensible method of dealing with eastern Europe's structural problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document's approach to environmental funding and its threatening tone worried me. The hon. Member for Daventry expressed that point helpfully. We support higher environmental standards in the world, in the European Union and in eastern Europe. Eastern Europe is particularly bad about some aspects of the environment. However, it is wrong to threaten eastern European countries with trade restrictions unless they pursue identical environmental standards to European countries, and to set aside funding for fulfilling arbitrary standards, which should vary and reflect the different conditions in different countries. The threat of environmental dumping lies behind at least some of the budgetary provision for structural assistance. I welcome a generous approach to applicant members. Some of the reasoning behind the Commission's calculation is a little suspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point deals with agriculture. I agree with the argument of the hon. Member for Daventry. In the UK, there is a broad consensus, which is shared by the National Farmers Union, that we should move towards a more market-led system of agriculture with lower price support levels. The hon. Gentleman's point should be reinforced: most of the calculations in the estimates do not take account of changes in the international climate. In 2005 or 2006, agricultural numbers need to be compatible with the World Trade Organisation, which will move on. Some of the direct subsidies that are currently permissible will not be allowed in 10 years' time if we move towards liberalisation. I am apprehensive that the Commission will regard the budget as a floor rather than a ceiling, and will be less flexible when it approaches the liberalisation of agriculture, which all members of the Committee support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the objectives that we support in agriculture and enlargment could be better achieved by freer trade than through budgetary mechanisms. I depart from some of my Opposition colleagues in believing that the European budget could achieve other useful aims. The Liberal Democrats would be happy with an enlarged European budget. However, priorities should be different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Vernon Coaker 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gedling)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I join my hon. Friend the Minister for Luton, North, in saying that it has almost been a pleasure to attend the proceedings this morning to debate a crucial issue? The new financial framework marks the start of a long journey. Clearly, much will happen before we arrive at the final financial framework. It is important that Ministers and other politicians participate in such a debate, but it is essential to try to engage the public in the debate over Europe. We need to educate the public—without patronising them—about the difficult decisions that have to be taken. That requires providing people with a significant amount of information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is easy to make cheap headlines out of some of our debates, but full discussion is needed to bring people along with us. After all, we are talking about taxpayers' money and we have a responsibility to use it as wisely as possible. That is why I was heartened by my hon. Friend the Minister's comments about the principles behind the negotiations: value for money and the efficient use of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who have served on local authorities may find budget setting in Europe staggering. Money had to be bid for, objectives set and success criteria measured. Funds would be removed if not efficiently used. Such criteria were fundamental, and if local councils did not match up to them, the electorate in the community would rightly wonder what had happened to their council tax, rates and so forth. There was openness about what was happening. People could see that £2,000 or £3,000 had been invested in a particular project and could read a report showing what had happened to it. If there was an overspend, all hell would be let loose and people would rightly be called to account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Europe, however, the budgetary process can be difficult to understand. Hon. Members may hear that a certain amount of money has been spent, but there is often no indication why, whether it has been spent effectively, and whether the objectives of the budget have been met.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making an important point. Does he agree that Sheffield local authority—to take a non-contentious example—has clear accounting practices and that, after many years of effort under several Administrations, the UK has a reasonably clear system of accounting but that the EU—if the hon. Gentleman will cast his mind back to
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
the draft preliminary budget—has a system that makes it virtually impossible for people to understand what is in the budget?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt, but I remind the Committee that we must leave time for the Minister to speak. If we prolong our debate with too many interventions, some hon. Members will be unable to speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for West Dorset on the need for clear objectives and clarity in setting the success criteria for any budget system. I was drawing an analogy with my experience on a local council, when everything was laid down. Without clear objectives, we would not receive the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and the hon. Member for Daventry made the point that, simply because there is money and a ceiling, the money should not necessarily be spent. My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South made a similar point. We must get the budget right if the general public is to have confidence in the system
The agricultural budget may be beyond this Committee's remit, but without reform of the common agricultural policy, many of the other objectives that we are trying to meet in the new financial framework will be difficult to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point relates to something about which I have felt very strongly for a number of years. We must move away from the idea that because we have put £10 into Europe we should get £10 back in a rebate. We should be thinking of an investment in the concept of a Europe where all people, including our own, work together so that everyone can develop and prosper. That is difficult if we believe that because the British contribution is £2 million, or whatever it is under the financial framework, we expect this and our rebate will be that. It is a narrow definition if the figures do not match exactly and the argument revolves around pounds in and pounds out, without reference to the stability that European nations co-operating with each other can achieve in prosperity, jobs, and other areas of policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a very worthwhile debate this morning. I hope that the Minister will take our views with her to the talks, and start the long process of achieving a tighter, stricter financial framework, which will allow us to meet our objectives and to achieve value for money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.35 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been reassured by the tone of our debate. The Committee has functioned as it should function. The comments made by the hon. Members for Gedling (Mr. Coaker) and for Stoke-on-Trent, South reinforced the opinion that I expressed in Committee a few weeks ago, when I was scoffed at, that on many of these issues there is a distinctly British view, which is different from that of our continental neighbours and the Commission. In the case of the matter under
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0259">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
discussion today, we have a rigorous approach to such financial matters, which is not universally shared in the continent of Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative members of the Committee feel comfortable with what is set out in the explanatory memorandum, which is broadly on track in our view. On a slightly discordant note, however, I am surprised that no one has yet focused on the Commission's assumption that the ceiling should grow in line with GNP growth. That represents a 17 per cent. real growth in resources based on the projected growth rates used in preparing the document over the six-year period. It may be the case—I do not know and perhaps the Minister will tell me—that the Government would not expect public expenditure in the United Kingdom to fall as a share of GNP over the next six years. But it seems to me to be clear that there are member states that must, or at least should, expect public expenditure to fall as a share of GNP in the next few years. In those circumstances, it seems outrageous that we should accept the Commission's baseline that they are doing very well and implementing a rigorous financial discipline on themselves if they merely have the 17 per cent. real growth implied by keeping the ceiling at a constant percentage of GNP. I urge the Minister to consider whether we are being rigorous enough in saying, "Yes, let's stick to the 1.27 per cent."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One justification for leaving a margin between planned expenditure and the ceiling listed in the document is the possibility of overspend in the transitional arrangements, as explicitly stated in the document. I was delighted that the Minister was able to reassure me earlier that we would not accept any open-ended transitional arrangements that were not, to use United Kingdom parlance, cash limited. If we can be assured that the cost of the transitional arrangements will be limited, it will be useful to present member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanatory memorandum focuses sharply on the United Kingdom contribution and abatement. In the discussion yesterday on structural and cohesion funds, we heard that there is a significant possibility, which the Economic Secretary was unable to quantify, that the United Kingdom will see a reduction in the amount of funding that it receives from the Union. That will come about as a result of the more rigorous application of the criterion on the 75 per cent. average of gross domestic product under objective one and by the more specific targeting of geographical objectives. The United Kingdom can expect a reduction in funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom will also expect an increase in its contribution in real terms if the ceiling is kept at 1.27 per cent. of the EU gross national product. As the Union GNP grows, so the United Kingdom's contribution will increase. As a result of enlargement of the union, the United Kingdom will also expect a smaller receipt from Union funds coming back to the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To strengthen my hon. Friend's point, does he accept that an increase in total GNP-based resources and the likelihood of convergence between
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
United Kingdom GDP and the average GDP of the current EU fifteen means that there will be a further increase in the United Kingdom's contribution?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, my hon. Friend makes a good point. Our contribution will increase as the VAT element decreases and the GNP increases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not disagree with the Government, but it is vital that they stand firm on the United Kingdom's abatement. The criterion should be fairness, and it should be based on an examination of Britain's relative prosperity compared to that of other members of the Union. Our net contribution must be fair. We must resist attempts by the Commission to impose a mechanistic redefinition of the way that the abatement is calculated that would be disadvantageous to the UK.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it difficult to understand how the Government, who .have made it clear that they do not want to be confrontational with our European partners, will square the rigorous defence of the UK's abatement and a fair distribution of our contribution with some of our partners' strong opposition to the abatement arrangements. Will the Economic Secretary give us her thoughts on how the Government will defend the UK's position without running into the sort of oneagainst-14 confrontation that we have seen in the past?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission tells us that the administrative budget will grow slightly more slowly than the Union's GNP. That is good, but it is not good enough. The baseline of administrative expenditure is far too high and again I detect a tone of complacency in the Commission's document. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Institutions will have to be equipped to assume a bigger role … in a more diverse community."</p></blockquote>
Of course, costs will be associated with enlargement and the institutional adaptation to enlargement. What the bigger role is escapes me, but we should be wary of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 84 of the Commission's documents states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If and when the Union were to require an increase … beyond the present 1.27 per cent. of GNP ceiling",</p></blockquote>
it might be time
	<br><blockquote><p>"to re-examine the whole structure of the system".</p></blockquote>
The Government should clearly signal that they do not envisage there being any such time within any foreseeable framework and that 1.27 per cent. of what is hoped to be a significantly growing GNP will be perfectly adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Economic Secretary has yet to mention it, the explanatory memorandum refers to the UK's important suggestion that we should anticipate post-enlargement pressures beyond the 2006 horizon outlined in the document. We should look now at reducing expenditure and at increasing the head room within the ceiling, so that after 2006, the pressures can be dealt within existing ceiling constraints rather than from a point that is already at or very close to the ceiling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both sides of the UK's political divide agree that if we see a problem on the horizon seven or eight years away, now is the time to begin considering it and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0260">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
planning to deal with it. We should not bury our heads in the sand, as the Commission perhaps appears to be doing, and then worry about it in 2006.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A couple of issues are not dealt with in the explanatory memorandum. We have already conducted a brief discussion about the underlying growth assumptions and whether the newly acceding countries will be able to fulfil them. We have talked about whether ERM membership is a requirement. Following the exchange on the subject of different texts, I should be grateful if the Minister could state that we will not allow the newly acceding member states either to be required, as a legal condition, or to be bullied by the Germans and French—who are anxious for European monetary union to proceed apace—into joining ERM on accession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise the need for vigilance in preventing diversion of structural and cohesion funds to support the European monetary union. The Minister told us earlier that that would not happen, but it is difficult to see where the transfer of funds, which many people believe will be inevitable within a single currency zone, will come from. I do not imagine that the German and French Governments envisage large-scale bilateral transfers to prop up the weaker member states as necessary. I imagine that those Governments assume that, sitting in their Euro X Committee, from which we may be excluded, they will be able to redirect relevant funds in one way or another to support the objectives of the single currency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom's approach seems to be more rigorous than the Commission's. The explanatory memorandum makes that clear. If the Government will hold firm on the issue of the overall budget, perhaps going a little further than the explanatory memorandum in questioning the Commission's base line that there should be an increase in line with GNP; if they will insist on forward planning involving scrutiny of the post-enlargement problems beyond 2006; if they will hold firm in ensuring a fair contribution by the United Kingdom in future, so that we do not fall victim to some mechanistic adjustment of the abatement; and if they will remain vigilant on the question of diversion of structural and cohesion funds to support the single currency, Conservative Members will given them our full support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.47 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join my colleagues in saying how useful the debate has been. It reaffirms my commitment to the scrutiny process. Some scrutiny debates have ended up more like bear gardens, but we have had a very useful discussion in which many helpful points were made. I shall try hard to encompass them all in my reply, but given the volume I may not manage to cover them all. In that case, I shall make sure that hon. Members receive a response from me in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to first principles, where we began our discussion of the concept of enlargement, the opportunity is both exciting and challenging for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
European Union. If we do not make the right decisions, and, as the hon. Member for Runnymead and Weybridge said, if we do not take them far enough in advance to allow them to bed in and their true impact to be analysed, we could have considerable problems. That is why I made, perhaps, a bit of a meal of our determination that spending should be well below the 1.27 per cent. limit. We want to provide the necessary margin and to allow the pre-planning that is required to ensure that resources will be available at the point of accession of an incoming member state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Through our commitment to financial rigour—which is not an exclusively British phenomenon; several member states are committed to the budgetary rigour that we view as essential—we want to set the tone for the applicant states. It must be clear how important it is for the functioning of the European Union that budgetary rigour should be recognised and built into their structures in the process of transition. That will be significant for the future of Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the support from the hon. Member for Daventry and his hon. Friends for the position that the Government are adopting. I agree with him; we have a sensible start in the Commission document. Both sides recognise that we cannot accept everything that is in the document. The hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) asked which translation of the document took precedence. Neither has a position in law. Whether written in French or in English, it is here to guide our discussions and to help us to formulate a way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will respond to a number of points and I apologise if they are not in the order in which they were raised. There is a great temptation to concentrate much of our remarks on the CAP as there are significant issues connected with that. I was amused, and agreed with the hon. Member for Daventry when he said that the CAP had an amazing propensity to survive. If enlargement is to have a real impact, if we are to have an enlarged Community that expands the opportunity for every member state, the CAP cannot possibly survive in its present form. Policy reform on agricultural policy must go ahead in parallel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also important to recognise that other member states are now aware of our need to be much more precise and measured in our attitude to agricultural spending. I will undoubtedly come back, at various points in my remarks, to the issue of agriculture. I ask the Committee to accept the Government's commitment to ensure that there is reform of the CAP as we go ahead with enlargement. It will not be an easy process. It will require negotiation, but we will negotiate. We will not go into these discussions intent upon beating people about the head as a route to securing agreements. It will be a complex relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Daventry asked about administrative savings. I take his point entirely. There is an assumption by some people, when talking about European money, that it is money that belongs to someone else. But we are talking about European taxpayers' money, and that is a theme to which I return repeatedly in the Budget Council. Sometimes there is a view in the Parliament that it is Europe's money; it is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0261">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
a new definition of "community charge". The reality is that it is the money from taxpayers from each and every member state, so we must be very precise about how it is used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two parts to my answer to the question about administrative savings. The first is about rigour and about ensuring that there is a true management of resources. The second is that yes, there will be some slight increases in administration in relation to, for example, translation. The volume of paper will increase as an unavoidable consequence of enlargement. But, at the other end, that means that there must be much greater pressure on the Commission and the institutions to ensure that they spend their money properly. Again, we return to the need to ensure that there is no financial mismanagement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We talked at one point about the transition arrangements that must take place between now and the accession of the new member states. I entirely take the point made by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge about there being no open-ended commitments and that there must be cash limits. However, we must be mindful of the fact that those member states have a serious transition to go through. If there are changes in the prosperity of the existing fifteen, we must make sure that they do not protect themselves while the applicant states, because of their much poorer position, are unable to make the required transition arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will have to be part of the discussions. We must strike the right balance on that as we must on the issue of fraud, which was raised by the hon. Member for East Londonderry. I take his point that it is often the innocent person with no intention to defraud who makes a mistake and suffers as a result. We must be careful in pursuing that line that we do not go over the score in relation to pragmatism. The very argument that I use about other member states is that they may have considered themselves pragmatic in relation to olive oil trading or other matters. There is a threat in there, too; we must make sure that we do not allow a back door for those who perhaps use pragmatism as a route to a loose interpretation of the rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return now to the point made by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, who asked about the kind of assumptions that were being made by the Commission. It is not clear what stage we are at in relation to those assumptions, but this will be the subject of detailed, line-by-line negotiations whenever we get to that point. We must make sure that we do not change the overall picture in relation to that fine tuning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Daventry also raised the issue of a fifth resource. That has largely come from the Spanish. It has been tied up in a lot of other issues that have been raised this morning. I must be quite explicit: we do not want a fifth resource. Apart from anything else, it would reopen the own resources decision and therefore the issue of the ceiling. My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South is absolutely right
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
about the psychological tendency to view those ceilings as targets. They cannot and must not be viewed as targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ensure—and not just in global terms—that the budget comes in with a sufficient margin underneath. We must also ensure that, within the existing budget headings, we do not continue this regime of plucking a figure out of the air, because we think that that is what might be needed at the end of the day, and accepting that we will live with an underspend. That is bad budgetary planning as I pointed out in my earlier remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of hon. Members talked about the budgetary system. I find it as clear as mud on most occasions. If there is a way to be obscure, the Budget Council will find it. I take up the point made by hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North, that here is an opportunity to change the way we set budget headings. I think we should deal with enlargement. Let us not make it any wider and any more coherent. I have just seen the time so I will accelerate dramatically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Green Paper on supplementary pensions is being brought out by the Commission. I will write to the hon. Member for Daventry with details of that because it is a fairly complex issue. The hon. Member for East Londonderry raised the matter of research and development policy. In our domestic policy we have made policy changes with a view to encouraging companies to retain more profits that they can use for research and development purposes. In the EU context, the Government support the EC framework programme for research and development where that genuinely adds value on a European level. We must not go down a route that hampers our domestic research and development opportunities. Many member states are conscious of the balance in that and we will be keeping a close watch in relation to the fifth framework next year. We want to maintain the fifth framework programme, but we want to improve its focus and efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the environment, I would like to refer the hon. Member for Daventry to the evidence that I gave to the House of Lords, the conclusion in the House of Lords report and paragraph 91 with which the Government broadly agrees. We want to minimise the transitional periods, but we recognise that there will be a need for some transition in areas of environmental improvement. There are significant difficulties connected with bringing environmental matters up to speed. If there are other matters that I have not been able to cover, I apologise. I will certainly respond to individual hon. Members by letter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
