Welcome, Mr. Winterton; I hope that you had a good weekend. Later, I may say a few words about my weekend and the Chancellor's visit to and his comments about my constituency—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Within the scope of the Bill, I hope.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is why I said later—when we debate another clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause is intended to sort out the tax regime for subcontractors, who are colloquially known as the "lump" in the construction industry, in preparation for self-assessment. I am sure hon. Members are aware that this is a complex area and that it is the source of great concern about tax avoidance or even tax evasion. The rules are complex and the clause was introduced to stand alongside the voluntary registration scheme. The Labour party has been pressing for a registration scheme for some time, and although we would have preferred a non-voluntary scheme, we are pleased that at least a voluntary scheme has been introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments that we have tabled to both the clause and the schedule are designed to probe the Government's intentions—whether they are confident that they have correctly set the amount at which liability will become a necessity and whether the proposed date is right. Some of the people involved in the construction industry believe that the amount is not right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all looking for ways of ensuring that tax is paid when it should be paid. This is a complex and difficult area, from which have arisen notorious stories—many of which have been made into television soap operas—of finding clever ways to avoid or evade tax. It is therefore important that the right level is struck so that there is no temptation to run away from making an honest declaration. The amendment was tabled in the spirit of probing the Government on their logic in setting the amount at the level stated in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>590</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Sir George Young)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Queen's Park Rangers also had a satisfactory weekend at the expense of Wimbledon. I say that before my parliamentary private secretary—my hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon (Dr. Goodson-Wickes)—returns to the Room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Durham, North-West (Ms Armstrong) asked me to consider her amendment in a broader context and to describe the Government's progress in introducing the new scheme. It may help our subsequent debates on this clause and schedule 27 if I sketch in the background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measures introduce a number of changes to the special tax scheme for the construction industry. The scheme has been in existence since 1971. It was established to counter the tax evasion that was rife among self-employed building workers. The scheme requires a contractor to make a deduction on account of tax and national insurance contributions each time he pays a subcontractor for work relating to construction operations. However, those subcontractors who can demonstrate their compliance with tax and national insurance obligations can obtain certificates entitling them to be paid without deduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim of the scheme was to ensure that certificates were granted only to those carrying out genuine and substantial business operations. That was achieved by requiring that the applicant should show that his business was carried on from proper business premises, with proper equipment, stock and other facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those rules have allowed considerable scope for wide interpretation, however. As a result, the rules have proved to be increasingly ineffective in meeting the original aim of the scheme and certificates are now widely available. Many subcontractors who do no more than provide their own labour have been able to obtain a certificate with relative ease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The weakening of the scheme has facilitated tax evasion in the industry through the misuse of certificates. Those having an itinerant or peripheral involvement with the industry cannot be denied a certificate on that ground alone. When they are not carrying out work within the industry, however—because they are working privately, are on non-construction-industry operations, or are unemployed—they have no immediate use for the certificate. Unfortunately, some individuals in such circumstances are tempted to sell their certificates or allow them to be used by unauthorised persons. That has caused a black market in exemption documentation, leading to substantial loss of revenue to the Exchequer. To overcome such problems, the Government propose to provide a more objective test of the size of the business by introducing a new turnover test. That will restrict eligibility for certificates to those subcontractors whose annual business turnover in construction operations exceed a prescribed level to be specified in regulations. The exact level of turnover will be specified in regulations, with the figures determined close to the probable commencement date of 1 August 1998. That will help to ensure that certificates are issued only to those carrying on substantial business operations within the construction industry. The remainder—probably more than 80 per cent. of all subcontractors, as opposed to less than half currently—will be made up of individual workers supplying their own labour and little else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0841">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>591</span>
Restricting certificates to the more substantial business operations will also help to curtail the current level of tax evasion through understatement of profits and the nonpayment of tax, with the deduction on account of tax and national insurance contributions safeguarding the Exchequer. Although the extent of the risk posed by fraud and evasion in the industry cannot be accurately quantified, known investigated misuse of documents amounts to more than £20 million and the tax written off through unpaid duties is estimated to exceed £50 million. The total tax at risk from all areas within the industry is believed to be far in excess of those figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new rules will have no effect on the actual amount of the subcontractor's tax bill. Any deductions that exceed the actual tax liability are repaid to the subcontractor at the end of the tax year. The current rate of deduction is 25 per cent.—equivalent to the basic rate of income tax—but it takes no account of personal and other allowances. Thus the vast majority of subcontractors receiving payments under deduction currently overpay tax significantly during the year and have to claim a repayment after the tax year end. We intend to reduce the rate of deduction so that the new rate will more closely approximate to a typical person's effective liability after allowances have been taken into account. That will ease the burden on those switching over to the deduction side of the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We propose to dispense with the requirement that an applicant for a certificate must have worked in the United Kingdom for a period of three out of the last six years—a rule that has proved to bear harshly in certain cases and that has proved to be the source of much complaint. On the other hand, it will no longer be possible for a subcontractor who has failed to meet his tax obligations during the three years prior to his application to bring them up to date simply in order to qualify for a certificate. In future, he will have to ensure that he complies with all statutory tax and NIC requirements as and when they arise throughout that period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also propose to streamline the penalties for false certificate applications and misuse of documents. That will enable the Inland Revenue to consider civil penalties as an alternative to criminal sanctions in future. Government Departments which engage construction industry labour will be required to operate the scheme for the first time, bringing them into line with businesses and local authorities. The limit of expenditure on construction work that requires businesses outside the construction industry to operate the scheme will be quadrupled from £250,000 to £1 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those changes will come into effect no earlier than August 1998, thus giving the industry plenty of time to gear up to the new regime. The Inland Revenue has consulted representative bodies and unions in the industry and the proposed changes have been greatly welcomed. As a former Minister with responsibility for the construction industry, I know that many in the industry will welcome the changes that we are introducing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause and schedule contain the main principles of the proposals. The detail of the administration of the construction industry scheme—the nuts and bolts of how it will operate—will be contained in regulations, as is the case with the existing legislation. The new arrangements will not come into play for more than three years and it is
	<span class='label label-info column'>592</span>
too early to lay regulations yet—especially those relating to the level of turnover or the tax deduction rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are conscious that subcontractors and contractors within the industry and taxation professionals need as much notice as possible of the details of how the scheme will operate. I have authorised the Inland Revenue to publish draft regulations for the purpose of consultation and the Revenue will consult widely with the industry before regulations are laid before Parliament. That is the background and I hope that it will save debate on subsequent amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept the amendment, which would tie the rate at which deductions are made from the earnings of those subcontractors without certificates to the lower rate of tax. We intend the deduction rate to approximate more closely to a subcontractor's effective liability, taking account of allowances, which does not happen at the moment. That rate can be set only against the background of the income tax and NIC rates in force at the time. By arranging for the subcontractor deduction rate to be specified by Treasury order at the beginning of the relevant tax year, we shall be able to set a rate that can achieve that end. Pinning it to the lower rate of tax would not necessarily result in sufficient tax being deducted at source. I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 264, in page 141, line 2, leave out "1 August" and insert "6 April".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, there is some confusion in the industry about why the commencement date should be in August and not at the beginning of the tax year in April. The purpose of the amendment is to obtain clarification from the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I cannot accept the amendment, which would bring forward the earliest date on which the appointed day may be set in regulations from 1 August to 6 April 1998. The purpose of the amendment is that the changes should take effect from the start of a tax year and not 1 August. That date was chosen deliberately as the likely start date for the changes because that will best ease the transition into the new arrangements for those subcontractors who will no longer qualify for a tax exemption certificate under the new rules. The consequences of the amendment would be to make the transition for those people more acute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The choice of 1 August has its roots in the self-assessment system, on which the Committee has spent a great deal of time. Self-assessment is a major change in the system of administering personal tax and the Government decided that it would be sensible to defer implementation of the changes to the special construction industry scheme until subcontractors had gained some experience of self-assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under self-assessment, construction industry subcontractors, as with all self-employed taxpayers, will make a first payment on account of their annual tax bill on 31 January in the year of assessment; a second payment on account on the following 31 July; and a final balancing payment on 31 January following. Thus, in the calendar
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0842">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>593</span>
year 1998, construction industry subcontractors will have to make the first payment on account of their tax bill for 1997–98 on 31 January 1998 and the second payment on account on 31 July 1998. Any balance left on the tax bill will be paid on 31 January 1999. For subcontractors who qualify for a certificate under the proposed new rules, it matters little from the point of view of tax payments whether the changes come into force from 1 August or 6 April. All payments will continue to be received gross and the tax due will be paid half-yearly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The choice of the start date is important for those who, under the new rules, will no longer qualify for the certificate and who, from the date of implementation of the changes, will receive their income under deduction of tax. The Government propose that those subcontractors should be brought within the tax deduction arrangements immediately after they have paid the second payment on account of their 1997–98 tax bill. In that way, they will have cleared the greater part of the 1997–98 tax bill before they start to receive income net of tax, which will be assessable for 1998–99.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In contrast, the effect of the amendment would be to deduct tax from payments that are received on or after 6 April 1998, before the second payment on account for 1997–98 was made. There would be a risk that subcontractors would be misled into thinking that they would not have to make a payment on 31 July 1998 because tax was being stopped from their income, not appreciating that the tax deductions would be on account of their tax bill for 1998–99.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most sensible approach is to ease the transition for subcontractors, who move into the tax deduction scheme from receiving payments gross, by timing the change to take effect from 1 August 1998 immediately after the second payment on account for 1997–98, as the clause intends. For those reasons, I hope that the Committee will reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With that information, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed.</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis MacShane 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rotherham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an issue in which I have taken some interest since coming into the House. I should like to make a few comments on the clause before the Committee votes on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of all the industries that we have in the United Kingdom, the construction industry is probably the most complex in terms of employment and competition. It also has the most cut-throat relations between all those who are involved, including the Government, the tax authority, the main employers, the subcontractors, the sub-subcontractors and the workers. One might say that it is a paradigm of contemporary conservatism, in which no quarter is given and no mercy shown. Each section involved—whether the business community, the Government or the employees—is out for its own interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a dramatic growth in self-employment in the industry. In 1979, self-employment stood at 1.9
	<span class='label label-info column'>594</span>
million; now, it is calculated as being 3.14 million. That is a massive increase of 1.2 million self-employed workers, who fall into the grey area of tax returns which the clause is attempting to sort out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will slightly amend the mechanisms under which tax is paid. Experts on the matter will know that there are two broad systems for tax payment in the construction industry. First, payment can involve the granting of a 714 certificate, which, in theory, allows a contractor to be responsible for the payment of tax. As the Financial Secretary said, there is much concern that full-scale tax evasion—rather than tax avoidance—will take place. Secondly, there is the so-called SC60 arrangement, for which individual workers can apply. However, we are mainly concerned with the first type of certificate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Durham, North-West drew attention to the worries raised by the construction industry about the level of assessment. In going through the relevant papers provided by the Treasury and the Revenue, the measures, even by the standards of remarkable vagueness in contemporary tax legislation, appear to leave a great deal of room for post-hoc interpretation at variable levels. Yet again, I find it curious that we are asked to pass an important law when consultation will take place after the event. Indeed, the Inland Revenue briefing document of 30 November 1994 said that wide consultation in the construction industry had occurred, although no details were provided. The Financial Secretary is offering another round of consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have taken part in meetings with construction industry subcontractors, which are below the level of main contractors but above the level of individual self-employed subbies. Those subcontractors employ 10, 20 or 40 men. They have talked to me and other colleagues about the great problems they face, in particular with taxation. As the Financial Secretary and my hon. Friend the Member for Durham, North-West said, tax certificates do not give a reliable guide to taxation paid or to employment in the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps hon. Members will permit me to listen to the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane). I am finding it increasingly difficult to do so because of conversations taking place on both sides of the Committee. Please show courtesy to the Chair and to the hon. Member speaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Winterton. I look forward to Madam Speaker and her Deputies being as kind to me in the Chamber. More often than not, they bring me to order and invite me to sit down. I am pleased by the wonderful football result this weekend and hope that Macclesfield, Mansfield, Manchester United or whatever your team is continues to win.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. So that there is no misunderstanding, my team is Macclesfield Town football club.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I thought that you, Mr. Winterton, had a nine-nil glint in your eye as you brought good news from the north west of England. I only track the results of the lower divisions of Yorkshire football with such intimacy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a substantial problem with tax regulation in the construction industry. It is a massive industry that is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0843">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>595</span>
important for the future economic growth of our country and it does not suck in imports. I shall not stretch your patience, Mr. Winterton, by straying into other policy matters, but both sides of the Committee and of the House have divergent opinions on the need to encourage a sensible planned growth of construction in which the industry can play a great part. Labour Members, looking to the future administration of tax regulations that will soon be the responsibility of my hon. Friends on the Labour Front Bench, believe that we should consider the regulations seriously and try and get the matter right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anecdotal evidence and scientific research show that the industry has been wholly out of control in the past 15 years with no effective knowledge of how its tax regulations operate. Anecdotal evidence, backed by more serious trade union research, shows that false names are often given on the forms, especially on the SC60.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That takes us back to the Spanish practice problem, which affected some elements of the print industry in the 1970s, when I was actively involved in that industry. I do not look back on this with pride, but the number of people in the print industry signing on as Mickey Mouse while fully employed caused the tax authorities great heartache. There are similar problems in the building industry, where there is something of a vicious circle. Some people are given the 714 certificate, discover that all their tax has been deducted and then discover that, although they are trying to obey the tax rules, they may not be eligible for the new look 714 certificate following the introduction of the new, more stringent criteria. Those people will be left in a black hole. That point was addressed by the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Durham, North-West, which has been withdrawn, but I hope that, in replying to the debate, the Financial Secretary will seriously examine that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, registration is the way forward. The Government are finally beginning to accept the Opposition's view that a form of registration for all employees in the industry is overdue. The exact nature of a registration scheme is a matter for discussion, but it touches on the whole debate about identity cards and other forms of identity that people may be required to carry in future in order to gain access to certain rights as citizens, as well as to indicate the responsibilities that they accept by working in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary should consider two mechanisms that work in other countries. For example, in the United States, under legislation dating back to the 1940s, all building contracting that is carried out with public funds—that covers a large amount of buildings, roads and infrastructure development—must be undertaken by unionised labour. If they are still listening to me, I expect that Conservative Members will raise their eyebrows at the thought of a closed shop in the construction industry being introduced through the tax bill. However, that scheme has worked extremely well in the United States, which has a flourishing and successful construction industry, and where construction workers, their unions and employers work together voluntarily to ensure that there is fair pay and that a proper record of all employees is kept so that proper taxation is paid. In effect, there is more PAYE employment in the United States. That system might help to solve the problem without implementing compulsory registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>596</span>
The other scheme, on which I would welcome the Financial Secretary's comments, is the Australian practice. If people in Australia want access to almost any social security benefit, if they want to buy a car or engage in any substantive economic activity—short of living in a hole and being forgotten by society—they must state their tax number. That system was proposed by the Australian Government as an alternative to a compulsory ID scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps sharing the Anglo-Saxon tradition of not being keen on the foul continental European practice of having compulsory ID cards, the Australians looked for a mechanism that would not impose an ID card on everybody, but which would oblige Australian citizens to demonstrate who they were. They passed a sheaf of laws that obliged Australians to give their tax number to be able to participate in a wide variety of economic activities and thereby created a de facto ID scheme. That proved beneficial and cleared up many of the problems in the self-employed sector—which, in proportion to the national population, is as big in Australia as it is in this country—especially in the construction industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a useful debate. I am glad to note from the proposals in the Bill that the Financial Secretary is beginning to edge towards the arguments that have been put forward over the past 15 years by the Labour party and the construction trade unions, and which also reflect the views expressed to me by those in the middle range of subcontractors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process requires consultation. There are not separate, identifiable perspectives for employers, medium-sized subcontractors, wholly self-employed individuals, the Inland Revenue and trade unions. Everyone must come together in dialogue and partnership to find the right way forward for the industry to unleash its capacity and allow the flexibility necessary for what is a cyclical form of work, allowing fair competition between companies, obliging firms at all levels to accept their responsibilities and assuring individual employees that, although they may be increasingly expected to pay their share of the tax burden, they will be doing so on a par with all other elements in the industry without the cheating—in tax evasion and avoidance—which is, alas, the hallmark of the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I can pick through his rhetoric, I think that the hon. Member for Rotherham was supporting the Government's proposals. I have two points to make in response. First, he said that we were slightly amending the scheme. I think that he may have misunderstood the scale of the proposed reform, which could affect up to 500,000 people. Instead of approximately 80 per cent. of subcontractors qualifying for a certificate, that figure may fall to nearer 50 per cent., so the change is fairly substantial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman touched on the process. This morning we are agreeing on the framework for the new regime. We propose to continue consultation with those involved before bringing forward the more detailed regulations, draft copies of which members of the Committee have seen. I believe that that is the right way to proceed. We shall contact those in the industry who will be affected by the change and inform them of what they

	<span class='label label-info column'>597</span>
need to do, how to apply and what information will be needed so that the change—on which I think all hon. Members now agree—will be as smooth as possible when it is made in 1998.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are now dealing with the entitlement to exemption certificates in particular, though the amendments deal with the whole range of other issues covered by the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments relate to the level at which the income threshold should be set for entitlement to the 714 certificate. The Bill leaves that open, but representations have been made to me that it should be set at £45,000 so that the certificates—known in the trade as "714s"—will apply only to subcontracting firms and not to individuals who, in any other industry, would be treated as employees. That is one of the complications—there are many—arising from the way in which self-employed persons or individuals involved in the construction industry operate in order to try to get around rules. We are anxious to ensure that there is as little evasion as possible, which is another reason why we wanted a proper registration scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More generally, I want to comment on the manner in which the Government are using regulations in this part of the Bill, which is the ninth part of the Bill—if my counting is correct—in which major provisions are being put to regulation. The Government seem to be relying on regulations to an inordinate degree. Indeed, the subcontractor provisions in schedule 27 are uniquely reliant on regulations from both the Treasury and the Board of Inland Revenue. That makes it difficult to comment sensibly on the scheme's detail because we simply do not know it. We know the broad outline—the Minister knows that we are in favour of the broad outline—but the detail is missing because it is to be produced in the form of regulations. I shall comment on the draft regulations later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could list what the Government are putting to regulation, but it is there for hon. Members to read in the schedule. That so much is being put to regulation is more worrying because of the way in which the consultation process has been conducted. The Inland Revenue first introduced a consultation document, "Taxation of subcontractors in the construction industry", on 19 March 1991, which was Budget day that year. Reaction to the proposals resulted in an efficiency scrutiny to review the
	<span class='label label-info column'>598</span>
existing arrangements. The then existing subcontractor regulations were considered and laid before the House as the Income Tax (Sub-contractors in the Construction Industry) Regulations 1993, and they came into force on 6 April 1993. Those regulations did not really arise from the results of the consultation process or the review; they related to existing regulations and legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 10 February 1994, in reply to a parliamentary question, the then Financial Secretary announced that some of the 1991 recommendations would be included in the 1995 Finance Bill, subject to other priorities. He announced that the changes would come into effect after the introduction of the proposals for self-assessment and the simplification of personal tax—I shall not go on about simplification as we have covered that ground—in the 1995 Finance Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No announcements were made in the Budget statement or in the Budget day press releases, but the present Financial Secretary announced on 30 November 1994, in reply to a parliamentary question, that the 1995 Finance Bill would include the changes that were announced on 10 February 1994. The Financial Secretary also stated that the Inland Revenue had consulted widely within the construction industry—he has reaffirmed that this morning—especially on the question of the industry's costs in administering the scheme. He also announced that a compliance cost assessment was available on request.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Draft legislation was published on 14 December 1994, with a request for comments by 10 January 1995. Even ignoring the intervening Christmas and new year holidays, that was an unusually short consultation period. The draft legislation was included, without any changes, in the Finance Bill on 4 January, and draft Inland Revenue regulations—dated for 1998—were released on 1 March 1995, with a request for comment by 24 April—again, a very short consultation period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft that we have been given is little more than a skeleton. The details of only one major topic delegated to the board have been provided, details of various key components of the scheme that were delegated to the Inland Revenue have not been provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned about the fact that so much is being put to regulation. This morning we are considering a schedule which will, I hope, make the major changes of which the Minister has spoken and which will affect a large number of workers in the construction industry—yet there is evidence of scant consultation and virtually no information has been given to members of the Committee about the nature of the regulations that the Government propose to introduce. I have described the process leading to the current position in order to reaffirm our concern about the manner in which the Government are dealing with this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this measure is intended to encourage more taxpayers to make the legal payment of their liabilities, we should be as open and clear as possible about our expectations of the industry and those who work in it. We have not had the opportunity to do that, because so much has been put to regulation that we have little clear idea of what the implications are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate your indulgence, Mr. Winterton, in allowing me to speak on these matters in moving the amendment. I know that the Financial Secretary needed

	<span class='label label-info column'>599</span>
time with his civil servants to deal with the precise details.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady raised two points—first, the process of regulation or primary legislation, and secondly, the specific amendment that she was moving and those grouped with it. I shall deal first with the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot accept the amendment—which would set the level of turnover of a business carried on by an individual at £45,000—for two reasons. The aim of the turnover test proposed in the schedule is to provide an objective means of restricting the issue of certificates to genuine and substantial business operations carried on within the construction industry. In particular, it seeks to prevent those offering nothing other than their own labour from qualifying for a certificate. If the turnover test is set too high, it could prevent those businesses that could reasonably be considered to comprise genuine and substantial operations from qualifying. For that reason the Revenue is continuing its consultations with the industry and with other interested parties to decide where the level should be set. In that way, those in the industry, the inspectors of taxes and the commissioners will not be faced with disagreement and debate over the meaning of words such as genuine and substantial, enabling them instead to rely on the simple objective test. However, as far as possible the new rules should not prevent such businesses from qualifying for a certificate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.15 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a simple question. The Financial Secretary has referred twice in replies to consultations with people in the industry. Will he confirm that those consultations have included the Union of Construction Allied Trades and Technicians, the main trade union for the building industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can. Mr. Cathcat is a representative of that union and is among those from the construction industry with whom we are consulting, together with Mr. Gallagher, the general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union. I hope that response reassures the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we need to be able to vary the level of the turnover test to take into account the prevailing economic climate in the industry. As drafted, the legislation will enable the figure to be set in regulations, allowing variations to be made as and when necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Lady wants that figure to be written into the Bill, primary legislation will be needed to change it. However, the same argument applies equally to the other two amendments, which relate to partners and companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady also considered that we were doing too much by regulation. Half of the time I am told that the Finance Bill is too long and too complicated, and the other half I am told that it is not long and complicated enough because too much has been delegated to regulation. Whichever way one goes, one is exposed to criticism—[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] There is a recognition of the opportunism of some hon. Members in those "Hear, hears".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>600</span>
We are setting out the framework. We are saying, "These are the broad rules: this is when we propose to ingtroduce them and this is how we propose to operate the new scheme." We then say, "The actual details need not be finalised until closer to the date when the scheme is introduced and they should not be finalised until we've had further discussions with those who will be affected." Hence the framework in the clause and schedule. Hence the draft regulations that I circulated in a letter to you, Mr. Chairman, and to members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Durham, North-West said, we started consulting in 1991. More consultations between industry representative bodies, including the construction industry unions, were held last summer. There were further meetings in December last year about the content of the legislation. Our consultations over the regulations will continue until spring. We have done our best to involve those who will operate the new scheme. We are taking decisions at the right time. We shall choose the figures that are appropriate—those that the hon. Lady mentioned and the deduction rates—in the light of the tax regime at the time. To divide legislation between primary and secondary and to consult as we go along, is a responsible approach. On reflection, the hon. Lady, will not, I hope, press her amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 268, in page 325, line 49, after "partners", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"entitled to 5 per cent. or more of the income of the partnership".</p></blockquote>
The turnover test is the issue behind the amendment. The turnover test formula for partnerships in companies involves multiplying the standard turnover limit by the number of partners and beneficial shareholders. Representations have been made to us suggesting that that might lead to a substantial increase in the minimum turnover limit. The amendment proposes to limit the number of partners included in the test to those entitled to 5 per cent. or more of partnership income.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I am afraid that I must invite the hon. Lady to reflect on whether that proposal should be incorporated into the Bill. That proposal aims to disregard for the purposes of the turnover test any partner whose share in the income of the partnership is less than 5 per cent. I welcome the opportunity of explaining to the Committee why the Government consider the turnover test to be necessary in deciding whether construction industry subcontractors qualify for certificates entitling them to receive income from construction operations without deduction of tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme's original aim was to ensure that certificates were granted only to substantial businesses carried on from proper business premises with proper stock and equipment. As I have already explained, the scheme led to the misuse of certificates, an illegal black market in tax exemption documents, tax evasion and fraud. That is why we are moving to a more objective test, which is based on the size of the business and which particularly examines its turnover. The turnover test will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0846">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>601</span>
restrict eligibility for certificates to subcontractors whose turnover exceeds a prescribed level to be set in regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals with the test of partnership, which is based on the same principle. The qualifying turnover level for a partnership will be the product of the number of its partners and the turnover test level for an individual subcontractor. In that way, an individual subcontractor and subcontractors in partnership will be on a level playing field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will understand that the special construction industry tax scheme is anti-evasion legislation aimed at a sector of the industry where, sadly, tax evasion has historically been prevalent. It is essential to avoid loopholes in the legislation as experience has shown that they will be exploited by those who want to gain a certificate for gross payment and who evade payment of their proper tax dues. That works against the interest of the vast majority of honest citizens, including those in the construction industry who pay their taxes in full and on time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment proposes relief from the full rigour of the turnover test for partnerships that contain what might be called minority partners—those entitled to less than 5 per cent. of the income. At face value, that seems fair. The Government recognise that there may be a few genuine cases in larger partnerships where one of the partners may have a small interest as well as running his or her own business somewhere else. In such cases, the turnover test might bite hard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not believe that the amendment would resolve that difficulty and we have an alternative solution. If the amendment were adopted, partnerships that would otherwise not qualify for a certificate would be provided with a relatively simple means of avoiding the rigour of the turnover test by temporarily manipulating profit shares solely for the purposes of obtaining a certificate. Under existing legislation, the Inland Revenue could do little about that when considering the certificate application. By a relatively simple device such as the amendment, the purpose of the proposed changes to the scheme could be largely defeated. Providing a statutory remedy for avoidance of that nature that does not also affect honest businesses would not be straightforward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise, however, that there may be situations where the rigid turnover test bites hard on the genuine partnership with a large number of partners, not all of whom are directly involved in earning money for the business. For that reason, in paragraph 6 of the schedule, we have incorporated an alternative to the basic turnover test for partnerships. Consequently, partnerships may still qualify for a certificate—even though they may not meet the basic test—if their income from construction operations as defined in the legislation exceeds an amount that will be set in regulations. The Inland Revenue will consult with representative bodies about the level of that alternative test before we set it. The Revenue's aim will be to pitch it at a level that, while not leaving it wide open to manipulation or avoidance by unscrupulous individuals acting in concert solely to gain a certificate, will prevent hardship to genuine partnerships with bona fide operations and partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background, I hope that there is an alternative solution to the problem and that, on reflection,

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be remiss of me not to comment on the clause, which in many ways is inoffensive. Opposition Members welcome it because it will relieve a small group of claimants who are penalised by the tax system when they are awarded incapacity benefit. During the passage of last year's Finance Bill, we attempted to delay the introduction of taxation on incapacity benefit by one year, but we failed to do so. We do not object to the tax in principle, but the Government have not quite got things right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are important concerns about the introduction of incapacity benefit. I have such problems in my constituency. On Friday, I heard the views of the Chancellor with resignation and honor. I happened to be in Consett that afternoon, where I had a surgery and attended the Women's World Day of Prayer. I am sure that the hon. Member for Erewash (Mrs. Knight) would not approve of my attending that service, which was held in a parish church. Many people there—most of whom were women—expressed their despair to me about the fact that their husbands or sons suffered from long-term sickness and many were receiving invalidity benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, there is the highest proportion of people in the country suffering from long-term sickness or invalidity. Many of them will be affected by the introduction of incapacity benefit. Many of them worked at the steel works, and have a small pension, so their incapacity benefit will be taxed. The Chancellor thought that they were still at work, but they are facing the trials and tribulations that are involved with the introduction of taxation on invalidity benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituents are extremely tolerant, but they were taken a bit beyond their normal tolerance levels by the Chancellor's remarks. He did not need to give them any further reasons to vote for me at the next general election—I have a majority that is good enough already, and I do not need additional votes. However, judging by the remarks that I heard over the weekend, he has done my majority a power of good. He has not done the Prime Minister much good in north-west Durham. However, I suspect that the Government do not worry about my region, which they know is a Labour area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Invalidity benefit already causes enormous difficulty. The tests for receiving it are drawn so tightly that many people are wrongly excluded from benefit. An honest and open society would recognise the contribution that such people make to society and the fact that they suffer
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0847">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>603</span>
long-term illness and disability because of the nature of their work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that in the clause the Government introduce some relief for that small group of claimants. The Opposition will therefore not oppose the clause. However, the Government would not think that our voting against the clause means that we accept the manner by which they have introduced the benefit. We are not happy about the effect that the provision will have on many thousands of people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>11.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause deals with Lloyd's underwriters' new style special reserve funds. I have never been a member of Lloyd's, and I have no intention of becoming one, so I have no personal interest in the matter. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley (Mr. Riddick), who is a member of Lloyd's, asked me to raise the matter. He has also written to my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clauses say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This clause corrects an unintended consequence of the provisions in the 1993 Finance Act",</p></blockquote>
which permit Lloyd's members to set up special reserve funds that are, effectively, tax free. My hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley wants to know whether one can draw income from a reserve fund that one has built up. He tells me that, in his view, the inability to draw income from that fund would be a disincentive to Lloyd's members to set up the reserve fund in the first place. I am not convinced by that argument, but I undertook to raise it with my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary. It would be helpful if he could put on record the fact that he thinks that that unintended consequence needs to be rectified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warwickshire, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise several issues with the Financial Secretary. Do the rules relate to a reserve fund that deals with future claims? Is it, as it were, insurance for the future? Or is it possible that past claims may be provided for by putting them into such a fund? That would maintain the tax benefits that arise for such a fund. A person would only take out when he needed to, at which point tax would be paid. However, at a later stage, he could also ensure that he did not have to pay tax on losses. If so, what implications does that have for the way that Equitas is being set up? Can future calls on Equitas take advantage of the scheme? That would have considerable implications. In effect, it would be a massive subsidy for the future of Lloyd's. If such a development were likely, we should know about it. Perhaps that is not the idea, but I should be grateful for clarification on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen to those who agree to become involved in Equitas, but who are not currently liable, as
	<span class='label label-info column'>604</span>
names, to incur substantial losses through asbestosis? If they make commitments through their syndicate to make payments on future calls, will they be able to put their money into funds in order to cover that? That would involve the Government subsidising the losses of names at Lloyd's, which is an important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim of the funds appears to be the setting up of a reserve for future insurance claims. However, several legal claims have arisen from negligent advice being given about how to reinsure, and where to do so. Is it possible to put into a fund the legal costs and damages that might be involved in legal claims made against agents or various syndicates which have given advice to names? That would avoid tax payments by the person who is being sued, if he lost. I may not have explained that very well, but I hope that the Financial Secretary has grasped the gist what I am saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is provision being made for those in Lloyd's who have incurred losses in the past in other ways, who may now have considerable claims outstanding against them? Can they put money into those funds, obtain various tax benefits and then pay out without having to pay as much tax as they would otherwise have to pay?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about corporate investors? We all know that the future of Lloyd's depends on ensuring that important new corporate investors are brought into the Lloyd's market. Would such investors consider it a disadvantage that names were setting up such funds and do the Government have any future provisions in mind to give similar advantages to corporate investors in the Lloyd's market?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lloyd's is enormously important to the City of London and to the UK economy. However, in recent years enormous damage has been done to it and, if Lloyd's is to continue, it is important that we ensure that it is properly run and regulated and that the difficulties that have arisen through incompetence, fraud and, in particular, inadequate regulation, are dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Treasury Select Committee is currently looking into the regulation of Lloyd's. I think that all the members of that Committee—several of whom are also members of this Committee—have been amazed at the way in which Lloyd's has been run and the substantial devastation of much of the British upper middle class that has been caused by losses, which amounted in 1989–91 alone to £7 billion. There have been half a dozen or so suicides, but the most telling statistic is the reduction in the number of names from 32,000 in 1988–89 to about 14,800 now. Many of them want to get out of the market and some estimates predict that the figure could be as low as 5,000 by the year 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The damage done by Gooda Walker, LMX, Spiral and other problems at Lloyd's to the reputation of the City of London and to the future of London's insurance markets is considerable. In tax provisions such as these we have to provide a degree of safety for the future of Lloyd's; we have to look to the long term in ensuring that the corporate interests that we want to bring in are not prejudiced; and we have to ensure that we provide some protection against the massive claims that will come. Chat Set, the financial specialist, has suggested that Lloyd's may already be under-reserved by as much as £10 billion. That is obviously a considerable worry and there have been suggestions that Lloyd's may even be insolvent. We
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0848">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>605</span>
found in our inquiries that it was enormously difficult to gauge whether an institution such as Lloyd's is insolvent. The Department of Trade and Industry has its work cut out to assess that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are enormous potential gains. I am especially concerned to know whether the provision has implications for Equitas, which is essential to the future of Lloyd's. It is an attempt to float off the pre-1986 debts, especially those relating to asbestos. If Lloyd's is to continue, Equitas must be successful. The provisions appear to be an attempt to give a subsidy to Equitas. I would be grateful if the Financial Secretary could clarify that. The success of Equitas is essential to Lloyd's, but do we want taxpayers' money to subsidise that success?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We debated the special reserve funds at some length in the Standing Committee which considered the 1993 Finance Bill. Our position was set out on 17 June 1993 in column 473 of 
	<i>Hansard.</i> I do not wish to repeat all the arguments, but one point is salient. At that time we believed that the Government's proposals for the special reserve funds were rather leaky vessels and we had a lengthy debate on the matter. On Report, the Government admitted that there were some leakages which needed to be stopped, conceding the thrust of what we were saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision allowed names to build up special reserves, but until the Government blocked a particular loophole it would have been possible for a Lloyd's member to have sheltered income in a way that we considered completely unacceptable. I quoted an article from the 
	<i>Financial Times</i> of 17 March 1993 in which Mr. Robert Saunders of the private bank Smith and Williamson said of the scheme, "This is generous". Indeed it was, which is why we pressed for the loophole to be closed and I am glad that it was. I was therefore intrigued to see that, two years later in this year's Finance Bill, the Government are still trying to plug a leak. We generally support them on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that Lloyd's is different from most corporations and that the tax treatment of Lloyd's names has traditionally been different. The special reserve funds that we are discussing were, I believe, set up by Sir Stafford Cripps in 1949, so they have a mixed parentage. Both main political parties support the general principle. I believe that all investors, whether in Lloyd's or anywhere else, should be treated the same, but we have always accepted that Lloyd's is different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lloyd's is clearly in a transitional period and it may well be that in the future there will be no individual names—or perhaps only a handful of them—but instead by corporate names, for whom the tax regime will be different and we shall have to revisit it. It is not in the interests of Lloyd's itself, of the insurance industry in Britain or of the City of London that anything completely, or even partially, disastrous should happen to Lloyd's. I hope that the efforts of the current management to put Lloyd's on an even keel are successful, because that would be for the good of the insurance industry and of the reputation of the United Kingdom as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Warwickshire, North (Mr. O'Brien) said, the problem with Lloyd's has always been poor supervision and regulation. The Conservative party must take a substantial part of the blame for that because it was the Conservatives who
	<span class='label label-info column'>606</span>
insisted on self-regulation in the Lloyd's Act 1982, which was passed on the back of a very large Conservative majority. The issues were canvassed at some length in a debate which we initiated in the Chamber last year. The debate makes fascinating reading and proves that it was not only Labour Members who were calling for better regulation. There was an entertaining dog fight among Conservative Members, roughly divided between those who had gained money and those who had lost money—though perhaps I am a little cynical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate sheds some light on what happened in 1982, before I even thought about becoming a Member of Parliament, and shows that the present regime does not work. I understand that the management of Lloyd's has asked the Government to legislate to change the 1982 Act but the Government have said, informally, that there is no chance of that because of the large number of Conservative Members who are Lloyd's names. The Government believe that some people might unkindly draw attention to that fact were the matter to be raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Department of Trade and Industry has primary responsibility for the regulation of Lloyd's, but as we are debating the matter it would be helpful if the Minister could say whether the Government now recognise that certain aspects of the 1982 Act need to be changed—in particular, the need to end self-regulation is paramount if Lloyd's is ever to recover and restore its former reputation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Warwickshire, North raised the matter of the solvency of Lloyd's, which was also raised by the chairman and the chief executive of Lloyd's when they recently gave evidence before the Select Committee. Speculation on the solvency of an insurance company can sometimes be unhelpful and I would not usually raise it, but if the management of Lloyd's has talked about it publicly, we should not be afraid to do so. I am worried that some people, especially those who have lost money, are determined to bring down the temple in the hope that they will receive something at the end of the day. Will the Minister assure us that the Department of Trade and Industry, which is responsible for ensuring that all insurance companies are solvent, is satisfied that Lloyd's is solvent and capable of continuing trading?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would a Labour Government introduce statutory regulation of Lloyd's under a US-style Securities and Exchange Commission? Would the cost of regulation fall on the taxpayer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is not what we propose. We do not want to import the SEC or its equivalent. I have said many times that we must have a British solution to regulatory problems based on the British market, which is different from the market in the United States. I am not convinced that introducing an umbrella-type organisation, like the SEC, to cover everything would be appropriate. There is a fear that the regulators would lose sight of what they should be doing and concentrate initially on setting up a bureaucracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that Conservative central office is following me around the country trying to get hold of my speeches so that the Prime Minister can selectively quote from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0849">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>607</span>
inappropriate parts. If the hon. Gentleman is really interested, I am happy to make my speeches available because they have been published. However, it would not be right to treat the Committee to a 45-minute speech on regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have often said in the Committee that self-regulation does not work anywhere. It has not worked in the House of Commons. If it had, we would not have had to haul in Lord Nolan to sort out our difficulties. In talking about improving the regulatory regime, we are not talking about more and more regulations. In some cases, I would rather have fewer regulations that actually worked than a profusion of additional regulations to cover every eventuality. We do not propose that the taxpayer should pick up the tab for regulating Lloyd's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) will find that many people involved in Lloyd's will now readily assent to ending self-regulation. Outsiders on a supervisory board might have asked questions about the way in which names were recruited and what was said to them and, crucially, they might have kept better control on the capacity of Lloyd's to underwrite the risks that it took on. Those who believe that we cannot do anything because the only alternative is to haul in an equivalent to the SEC are missing the point. It is possible to make changes where there is a practitioner interest as well as outside interest without necessarily needing more regulations. That is an important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wellington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Department of Trade and Industry have a greater role in the hon. Gentleman's proposals? Would he want to regulate Lloyd's on the same basis as the rest of the insurance industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is good practice for Question Time. We believe that the regulatory system for the financial services industry generally will suit the particular sectors of the industry. For example, we have various proposals for reforming the Securities and Investments Board regime and the Bank of England supervisory regime, which some might think are more pertinent that ever before as a result of what has been happening for the past 10 days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have an open mind about whether the Department of Trade and Industry or the Treasury should be the sponsor for the insurance industry. There is no rational reason why half the regulatory system should come under the Treasury and the other half come under the Department of Trade and Industry, especially in a case such as Lloyd's where the two cross over. That opinion is not unique to Opposition Members. When the Prime Minister decided that the Treasury should take on the SIB regime, it was not clear to me why the insurance industry was left behind. Some unkindly said that it was all to do with an internal row between the President of the Board of Trade and the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, who is not in good odour with Conservative Members. It is best to have one Department and one Minister taking responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beasonsfield raised a matter on behalf of the hon. Member for Colne Valley. I confess that at the time I missed the question in my endeavour to discover on whose behalf the hon. Gentleman asked it. I hope that when the Financial Secretary responds to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>608</span>
point made by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, I shall discern what the question was before I pass comment on it. However, I must say that any question from the hon. Member for Colne Valley will be treated by us with the circumspection that it deserves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask my right hon. Friend to give the Committee precise reassurances on this matter. One of the problems with Lloyd's is that it has consistently and systematically been under-reserved, partially because the Revenue has insisted that syndicates distribute the surplus remaining to them after the books are closed at the end of three years. Syndicates have not been able to make provisions or to keep reserves in their funds against the possibility of future deterioration by allowing the surpluses to carry forward to successor syndicates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before 1993, the Revenue did not permit individual names to make provisions for future liabilities and cash calls. Although those are not identifiable at the time, it is in the nature of the business that they will, from time to time, fall on names. The anomaly, referred to by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling), is that the revenue allowed names to make provisions up to £7,000 a year, irrespective of the amount that the name was underwriting—whether £100,000 or £2 million—and irrespective of the inherent riskiness of what was being taken on by underwriters. It made no sense to have an arbitrary figure of £7,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1993, the Government were extremely sensible and allowed names to make general provisions, given the nature of the business in which they were engaged, and allowed the proportion of the provisions to be set off before incurring tax to bear a relationship to the volume of their underwriting. That enshrined in law common sense and good practice in the insurance market. The Government also took the opportunity to remove the anomaly that prevented insurance companies from making general provisions recognised by the tax authorities. The absence of those had created a competitive handicap for British insurance companies. Their competitors, especially those on the continent, had always been allowed such general provisions for tax purposes. I hope that my right hon. Friend will not resign in any way from the principles that I have outlined and which we discussed in the Finance Bill 1993.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Am I right to suppose that, as with any other business, it is always open to names to write back provisions if they can reasonably do so? That allows names to withdraw money from special reserve accounts. It does not matter whether they withdraw the capital or the income because that is a meaningless distinction. They simply take money from the special reserve funds, thereby reducing the total general provisions that they carry against future underwriting liabilities. In so far as they withdraw moneys from the special reserve fund, those moneys will be subject to tax because they will be written back to profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is ambiguous and not clearly drafted, as with so much of the Bill. The clause could be interpreted as stating that it will not be possible, or allowed, for names to write back sums to profit—to withdraw sums from special reserve funds. Surely the object should be that when such sums are taken out of special reserve
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0850">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>609</span>
funds, they will be taxed at the names' marginal rate of tax. That is common sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will confirm that that will be the position, that will reassure names and all of us who have at heart the health and the good management and conduct of the Lloyd's insurance market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a fairly wide-ranging debate about Lloyd's. As the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central said, some of his questions fall to be answered by the Department of Trade and Industry—for example, questions about solvency and the legislative framework. I shall ensure that my ministerial colleagues in that Department read his speech and give him an appropriate answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's speech dealt with the question posed by his hon. Friend the Member for Warwickshire, North who was worried that the provision represents a leakage or concession. It does not. It corrects a defect in schedule 20 of the Finance Act 1993. The correction ensures that the provisions will work as originally intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield was right when he outlined what the clause does. My hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley had queried in correspondence with me whether we were doing what we intended and I have written to him. I have had no other representations from Lloyd's or other names about this and I shall explain what the clause does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 20 of the Finance Act 1993 makes it possible for members of Lloyd's to set up special reserve funds in which profits can be set aside to meet future losses. The intention is that a member should be able to pay up to half of any syndicate profits into a special reserve fund and to receive tax relief for that payment. Income and gains arising from assets in the fund are free of tax to enable the fund to build up to its maximum size quickly. Payments out of the fund will normally be allowed only to meet losses or to ensure that the fund does not exceed its maximum size and are taxable, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) rightly said. The intention is that the profits transferred to the fund and the income arising in the fund should be locked up in the fund until losses arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the present wording of paragraph 2(2) of schedule 20 of the 1993 Act is considered in the context of trust law, the effect is that income arising on fund assets must be distributed to members as it arises. That would enable members to withdraw income from the fund completely free of tax, defeating the purpose of the special reserve fund provisions. The new paragraph 2(2)(a) ensures that such income will be added to the capital of the fund as intended. That is the substantive change made by the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New paragraph 2(2)(b) prevents payments from being made into or out of a fund unless they are required or permitted under schedule 20. They are tightly constrained. There is no substantive change from the old paragraph 2(3), but some superfluous words have been eliminated. The aim now, as in 1993, is that the special reserve fund should be a tightly-controlled arrangement, designed for a specific purpose and not open to abuse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Or is my right hon. Friend saying that they will be allowed to use the provisions on special reserve funds only to meet losses and to take sums out only of the fund exceeds the amount provided for in schedule 20 in relation to the underwriting for the year in question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The legislation states that liabilities arising from earlier policies which materialise at a later date—this refers to the point made by the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North—may be met from the new special reserve fund. I shall deal later with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding. The hon. Gentleman was worried about whether that could apply to past losses. It could, but only if the policies had been written earlier, but the losses on them did not materialise until a later date. To that extent they could be met from the new special reserve fund.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Financial Secretary because he is saying that the provision is not new and that the objective is simply to tighten up previous legislation. The effect will be to give a substantial subsidy to Equitas because calls can be made not just on the losses that a person sustains, but on Equitas, which are losses that others may have sustained and on which a decision may have been made by Lloyd's to try to bring them together in the Equitas vehicle. If someone answers a call on Equitas, will he be taxed on the money that he must pay if the losses are not his own?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are circumstances in which payments of the premiums to Equitas could generate a loss which could be met out of the special reserve fund. It will depend on whether the payment is made at a syndicate level or at a personal level. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman with more details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding asked about the Revenue and its practice of stopping syndicates reserving. The basis of Lloyd's accounting, rather than Inland Revenue accounting, is to distribute a surplus arising in a year; the Revenue ensures that the correct profit is distributed and that no artificial deferment of tax liability can arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding referred to the earlier scheme, which was statutory but inadequate and rather cumbersome to administer. That is why the new special reserve fund was set up. Withdrawals from the special reserve fund are closely controlled by legislation and cannot be made at will. That is one reason for the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious that there may be other detailed points at the frontier of my knowledge of Lloyd's and possibly beyond, so I think it would be best if I dealt with some of those in correspondence, especially as responsibility for supervision of Lloyd's rests not with my Department, but with the Department of Trade and Industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have assured the Committee that the clause simply puts right a defect that prevents unintended access

	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to be allowed to make a brief further comment. I look forward to any additional information or briefing that my right hon. Friend can provide on the matter that I raised. In any business, provisioning is an important aspect because any business may incur liabilities in future and must provide for them. It is important that the management of that provision should be flexible and that it can be increased when that seems to be sensible, and reduced and written back to profit when that seems to be prudent. As I have learnt this morning from my right hon. Friend's explanation, it is undesirable that once moneys have been paid into a special reserve fund, they cannot subsequently be written back to profit. Clearly, if they are written back to profit, a tax charge arises, so the interests of taxpayers are fully protected. It is important that we do not introduce an element of artificial restriction in the management of the provision which Lloyd's names can make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if my right hon. Friend would further consider that point and I look foward to receiving his letter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a further quick question. Does the Financial Secretary know what the cost will be to the taxpayer not only of this provision, but of the overall construction of the funds?

If the funds can be used to subsidise premiums for Equitas, can he say what will be the cost of that subsidy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, perhaps I can write to the hon. Gentleman with the figures.

I shall write to the hon. Gentleman about the costs of the special reserve funds scheme, which, I suspect, we dealt with two years ago when we established the provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I simply cannot help drawing attention to what is happening in the local government review and to the activities of residuary bodies.

The Government are having to put to residuary bodies a series of matters that would previously have been decided democratically.

The clause makes a purely technical change to the definition of what constitutes a local authority for tax purposes. The change will ensure that any local government residuary body for England will be a local authority for tax purposes. It will, accordingly, be entitled to exemptions from corporation tax, income tax and capital gains tax, which the Taxes Acts grant to local authorities. It follows the model of previous local authority organisations, which have qualified as local authorities for tax purposes. The clause simply allows any new body set up under the Local Government Act 1992 to qualify as a local authority for tax purposes, as it would previously have done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The new clause deals with the difficulty that has emerged with claims to unrelievable field losses. The current time limit of six years for claims to unrelievable field losses is too restrictive and can reduce, or even deny, effective relief against petroleum revenue tax, if the time limit forces the claim to be made in a period in which other PRT reliefs operate. The issue has come to light in responses to clause 130, which restricts a company's ability to claim relief for non-field
	<span class='label label-info column'>614</span>
expenditure as part of an unrelievable field loss. The clause now remedies the problem by removing the time limit within which a claim for an unrelievable field loss must be made. This brings the rules for claiming for an unrelievable field loss into line with claims for relief for exploration and appraisal expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly with some trepidation on oil taxation matters since I was excluded from the Committee a couple of years ago for having the temerity to table an amendment on related issues. Will the Minister tell us whether the clause will remove the anomaly that appears to exist at present, whereby unrelated expenditure is to be deducted from the unrelievable field loss and lost for all time, instead of being carried forward and used again in another context under subsection (9). At the moment unrelated expenditure that has been claimed against the field that has been closed and, therefore, has an unrelievable loss, will be disallowed and be lost for all time unless it can be reused as a claim elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause deals with the timing of when reliefs can be obtained. At present, there is a limit of six years in which claims can be made. So far that has not been a problem because six years have not yet passed since the measure was originally passed. Some fields are now coming to the end of their cycle of exploration, development and production, however, so those problems are beginning to arise. There seems no good reason to retain the six-year limit. To insist on it would disable some companies from being able to offset relievable expenses and losses against profits arising from a field that, at that time, they had not acquired. We propose to abandon the six-year rule and to extend that period. In that respect, it is a relieving measure. Overall, however, clauses 130 and 131, which would prevent abuse the original avoidance sections, should save a lot of money—an estimated £25 million per annum. It was not anticipated that that amount should be lost through avoidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The non-field losses cannot be added to the losses accumulated on a specific field that, during its lifetime, has had losses in excess of the revenue amounting to it. The intention of previous avoidance provisions was never that non-field reliefs should be added to those unrelievable field losses and then transferred to other companies in the same group or, under clause 131, transferred entirely to another company. That would involve considerable cost to the Exchequer, especially as—as my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr Butterfill) is aware—a substantial loss has built up in the past. That loss amounts to as much as £3 billion of exploration and appraisal expenditure. It was not intended—and it would not be right—that it should be relieved by means of adding it to unrelievable field losses, which could be transferred intra-group or outside the group to another company. I hope that that somewhat complicated explanation answers my hon. Friend's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an esoteric subject. I think that I understand what my hon. Friend is trying to say—namely, those losses will be capable of being used under
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0853">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>615</span>
the terms of the provision subject to the time limit that he is now suggesting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can come back and have another go at trying to clarify. Clauses 130 and 131 aim to prevent non-field reliefs from being added to unrelievable field losses and then being transferred to another company within a group or outside a group to someone else. The clear intention behind those clauses is to try to prevent the transfer and use of non-field losses, which were never intended to be offset against profits arising and which would be subject to petroleum revenue tax elsewhere—in a group, on other fields or, outside that group, in another company. It is the case, however, that unrelievable field losses—the extent to which on a specific field the expenditures and costs exceed the total value of production—can be used without bringing in the non-field losses reliefs. Those can be transferred elsewhere in the group and, indeed, outside it. They will be of value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of the transferability provisions was to encourage the exploration of marginal fields whereby, if there was a risk that they would not pay their way, the losses could be used against other group companies or outside. That will continue to be of value and benefit. Although the petroleum revenue tax regimes have all changed—as my hon. Friend knows—the clause will ensure that the possibilities of that relief—either intra-group or outside—without non-field relief being added into it can continue beyond the six-year limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no good reason to continue that six-year time limit. In many cases it should be possible for companies to offset those unrelievable field losses against their liabilities with petroleum revenue tax on other fields later on after that period. To that extent, companies will welcome the measure, although it will close the door on an avoidance possibility that clauses 130 and 131 seek to correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way again. I accept his point on the relief on the unrelievable field losses but, quite properly, he excludes from that transferability unrelated expenditure that has previously been charged against the field. My understanding of the effect of the clause would mean that that unrelated expenditure will not be allowable anywhere else and will be lost for all time. That seems to me unreasonable. Surely it should be recoverable again in appropriate circumstances under subsection (9). Was it my hon. Friend's intention to disallow that unrelated expenditure for all time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend voices a concern that has been mentioned by, among others, the Law Society—namely, the provisions are harsh to the extent that the amounts of non-field relief deducted from an unrelievable field loss should be made available to a company to claim under its own rules, otherwise the company is effectively deprived of any relief for non-field expenditure. We believe that the change would add unnecessary complexity to the clause and would have undesirable consequences. Ordering rules would be necessary to identify which past reliefs were to be reinstated. Special rules would be needed to deal with time limits for cross-field allowance claims, which would be time barred by the time any restriction under clause 130 took place. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>616</span>
precise means of readmitting cross-field allowances would have to be spelt out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the change would be unnecessary because the impact of relief such as oil allowance and safeguard means that a field that ultimately generates an unrelievable field loss is unlikely to have had a genuine need to cover profits with non-field reliefs. Any losses at the end of the field life must first be carried back to set against earlier profits. In so doing, the impact of oil allowance and safeguard is set aside. It would be highly unusual for a field to need to claim non-field reliefs in earlier periods and to generate an unrelievable field loss later on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should add that undesirable consequences could arise if the non-field reliefs were to be reinstated because there would then be pressure to apply the same rule in existing circumstances where non-field reliefs claimed early to enjoy a cashflow benefit turned out to have been ineffective. That could be due to the operation of oil allowance, which provides a petroleum revenue tax-free slice of production, but which is displaced by any losses carried back to the period, whether on abandonment or otherwise. The same result in terms of petroleum revenue tax could be achieved in those circumstances by taking the losses and the oil allowance, instead of the losses and the non-field reliefs—but only with hindsight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wider reinstatement would give the oil companies a one-way bet against the Exchequer when claiming non-field reliefs, and would be very costly. Both for those reasons—cost and the undesirable consequences—and because of the lack of necessity and the complexity involved, we are not able to accede to the Law Society's suggestions and to the concerns expressed by my hon. Friend. Things are not as bad as they might at first appear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am checking that I shall be in order when I refer to clause 134.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, under section 42 of the Finance Act 1930, property can be transferred within a 90 per cent. group without stamp duty arising. The 90 per cent. test is measured in terms of issued share capital. Clause 132 deals specifically with the transfer of associated bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the clause the group test will be amended such that a stamp duty group will exist where there is a 75 per cent. ownership of ordinary share capital. That would appear to be a relaxation of the group rules but, in fact, in some cases it will represent a tightening up of the rules because in the past companies were able to create stamp duty groups by the use of fixed rate preference shares which would count as issued share capital even though, economically, there was no group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 132 applies to instruments that will be executed after the Bill receives Royal Assent. What is unclear is the position of transactions that straddle Royal Assent. By that, I mean cases in which there is a pre-Royal Assent contract and a post-Royal Assent conveyance. For example, if before Royal Assent an 85 per cent. group entered into a contract for an intra-group sale which was completed after Royal Assent, would the exemption for group transfers apply or would they be excluded?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an argument that relief would be denied in such a case because beneficial ownership would have passed under the contract prior to Royal Assent. The doubt arises because "Sergeant and Sims"—which, I am reliably informed, is the main authority on stamp duty—states that where the beneficial interest has previously passed to the transferee from an unassociated body corporate, the subsequent transfer would not qualify for relief. It is understood that the Stamp Office interprets "Sergeant and Sims" to mean that where parties are not associated at the time of contract, but are associated at the time of transfer, relief is not available. Notwithstanding those concerns, it is thought that the Stamp Office has informally indicated that, in the example I have described, relief will be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause also amends section 27(3)(a) of the Finance Act 1967. That section was intended to apply only when there was a real change of ownership in favour of a non-associated party. The provision, however, appears to be extremely widely drawn, and it could apply where the third party's only involvement in the transaction was to provide finance for the transferee's acquisition. Amendments Nos. 273 and 275 are intended to correct that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 273 ensures that relief should not be denied where, for instance, a bank's only involvement in the transaction was to finance the acquisition. Amendment No. 275 makes it clear that relief will be available for any conveyance after Royal Assent that meets the new criteria for a group, albeit that there was a pre-Royal Assent contract and, at that time, the old group test was not met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 276 similarly amends clause 134. Although transactions between two companies in the same group are generally free of stamp duty, there has
	<span class='label label-info column'>618</span>
been a long-standing anomaly under which the grant of a lease from one group member to another does not benefit from that exemption. Over the years, there has been much lobbying to eliminate that anomaly and we welcome clause 134's effect in doing so. But we still feel that amendment No. 276 could clarify the position and deal with the anti-avoidance provision that denies relief if a third party is providing or receiving any part of the consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In moving amendments to these, quite narrowly drawn, clauses we are trying to prevent the creation of an unfair situation where statutory instruments are the means of enacting a clause, and where contracts may be caught as a side effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Waterson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastbourne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just want to speak briefly. We have all received representations on this subject. I should declare an interest in that, as a solicitor, I am, in a sense, advancing the Law Society's view. I am indebted to Mr. David Lewis, who is chairman of the stamp duty sub-committee of the Law Society's revenue law committee—obviously a man of vaulting ambition—and a partner in Allen & Overy. Mr. Lewis has written to me and probably to other members of the Committee on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a problem because, by virtue of the provisions of section 27(3)(a) of the Finance Act 1967, relief under section 42 of the Finance Act 1930 can be denied where there is an arrangement such as that described by the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo). There is a major concern that if a bank is involved only in terms of finance, it can be caught.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1938, the then Treasury Minister, Lieutenant-Colonel Colville, explained that section 42 of the Finance Act 1930 was intended to recognise that the transfer of property of associated persons does not represent a real change of ownership and the provisions of section 50 were necessary to prevent abuse of the relief by the interposition of a small bridge company. It is clear from the debate—which I am sure you have read as carefully as I have, Mr. Winterton—that section 27(3)(a) of the Finance Act 1967 was aimed only at a situation in which there was a real change of ownership in favour of the non-associated party, but because the provision is drawn in such wide terms, it could apply when the third party's only involvement in the transaction is, for example, to provide finance for the transferee's acquisition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be pleased to try to reply to the points carefully made by the hon. Member for Bristol, South and by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before replying directly, I should like to explain that the clause, together with clause 133, changes the test for membership for stamp duty relief on transfers between companies in the same group. The clause applies to England, Wales and Scotland. Clause 133 amends the parallel provisions in Northern Ireland law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For many years, intra-group sales have been relieved from stamp duty, subject to certain conditions. There is no
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0855">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>619</span>
clear cut change of beneficial ownership in such cases and until now the test for establishing group membership for the purpose of relief on a transaction has been that either one company owns 90 per cent. of the other or that both companies are 90 per cent. owned by a third company. Ownership is measured by reference to issued share capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The test for corporation tax group relief is different, the main test being for 75 per cent. rather than 90 per cent. ownership and only ordinary shares rather than the whole of the issued share capital are taken into account. The clause brings the stamp duty test broadly into line with the corporation tax test and meets representations on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ordinary share capital is a more accurate measure of control than the whole of the issued capital and the change will mean that more transfers between companies will be free of stamp duty. Inevitably, there will be a few cases in which relief is denied under the new rule when it would have been available under the old rule, but the measure is broadly a relieving one which contributes towards rationalising the tax system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bristol, South asked me about situations in which the group relief control test affects transactions straddling the Royal Assent—that is, when there is a contract before Royal Assent and conveyance after it. The clause applies the new control test to cases in which the relevant document is executed on or after the date of Royal Assent. If the document is to qualify for relief, the two companies have to be associated at the time when it is executed. A conveyance executed on or after the date of Royal Assent could qualify for relief if the companies satisfied the new 75 per cent. control test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some circumstances, contracts for sale can be liable to duty. In that case, if the contract was made before Royal Assent, the companies would have to satisfy the present 90 per cent. control test to qualify for group relief on the contract. The subsequent conveyance of the property could also qualify for group relief if the companies were associated at the time of execution of the conveyance. If it was executed after Royal Assent, the companies would have to meet the new 75 per cent. test at that time to qualify for relief on the conveyance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that explains the situation, but if it does not, I shall be happy to give a couple of examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the assumption that the hon. Lady is satisfied, perhaps I could move on—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could I take up the Minister's offer of some examples, because I did not quite follow his last few points?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I give two examples, I should point out that stamp duty on certain transactions may apply when the contract is made, and, in other situations, it may apply when the conveyance is made. For example, when property is transacted, stamp duty falls on the conveyance rather than on the contract. However, when a trademark is transferred, stamp duty falls on the contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Examples have been raised by the Law Society, which the hon. Member for Bristol, South may have had in mind. Suppose, with a transfer of land, that a contract is drawn up before Royal Assent, but the conveyance is carried out after Royal Assent—if one company has 85
	<span class='label label-info column'>620</span>
per cent. of the other company at both times, could the conveyance qualify for relief? That was the hon. Lady's question. The answer is yes, because the conveyance would be executed after Royal Assent and the new 75 per cent. test would be satisfied at that time; equally, the earlier contract would be satisfied for a sale of land—that contract would not be liable to duty. However, in the case of a transfer of, for instance, trademarks, where there is a contract before Royal Assent but conveyance after it, and where companies meet the old 90 per cent. test but not the new 75 per cent. test, the contract would be liable to duty, if it did not qualify for group relief. The contract does not qualify for group relief unless the 90 per cent. test is met. It was asked whether that would automatically exempt the later conveyance as well—the answer is no, because the conveyance has to qualify separately for exemption in its own right. That is the crucial point. It is were executed after Royal Assent, the companies would need to meet the new test. It they did not, the conveyance would be liable to duty at that point. If all depends on the circumstances of the case. Relief also depends on other conditions being satisfied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some important points were made by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne and by the hon. Member for Bristol, South about the arrangements that can be made to avoid stamp duty when the transaction of a property takes it outside a group. Amendment No. 273, which was moved by the hon. Lady, is relevant to that matter. The Government's aim is to relax the 1967 rules, which prevent relief being used for avoidance of duty. The rules are in section 27 of the Finance Act 1967.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne will know, section 50, I think, of the Finance Act 1938, to which he referred—although he discussed a different section—was the original law. It sought to prevent stamp duty being avoided by arrangements that could be conducted inter-group on a property outside that group. However, because that law became increasingly deficient, it was updated in 1967. Section 27 of the Finance Act 1967 is the current corpus of relevant legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 273 would relax the 1967 rules, which prevent relief being used for the avoidance of duty. Those rules apply where, for example, there are arrangements under which the company to which the property is being transferred seeks to leave the group, or where the consideration for the transfer is provided by someone outside the group. The amendment would change the present rules, so that where a bank provided finance for a transfer, it would not prevent relief being given. The anti-avoidance rules may come into play when one group member buys an asset from another, and finance for the purchase of the asset is provided from outside the group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where the transfer is connected with an arrangement of the sort that was described in the legislation, relief is not due. Broadly, if the lender provides a specific loan with the intention of financing the purchase, and takes a charge on the asset, he would be providing consideration for the transfer. The anti-avoidance rules would apply and relief would not be given to the transfer. If the lender merely makes a loan which the company is not obliged to use to finance the purchase, the lender will not be a party to the arrangement for the transfer and the loan will not prevent relief from being given. The exact position will depend on the facts of individual cases, but I should emphasise that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0856">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>621</span>
it is possible to arrange bank finance without disqualifying the transaction from relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that it is not always easy to draw a clear dividing line in this area. A transfer within a group may not necessarily require finance from outside the group. We do not want to hinder genuine commercial transactions unnecessarily, but the amendment would leave scope for the lender to take over the asset or perhaps act as intermediary in a disguised back-to-back arrangement. We need to prevent abuse of the relief by means of financing arrangements which lead to or camouflage the removal of the asset from the group. The fact that finance comes from a bank does not by itself prevent that and for those reasons I cannot advise the Committee to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the explanation of the position post-Royal Assent and pre-Royal Assent, although I am not sure that I understood exactly, apart from being told that each case will be judged on its merits within the general rules that normally apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree with the Minister of State on amendment No. 273. He tried to imply that the amendment would disturb anti-avoidance measures, but it states specifically that it would apply only when a bank has provided the finance for the transaction. The amendment is tightly drawn and leaves all the other measures in place. The Minister of State made a general statement that we are attacking anti-avoidance measures but he did not deal specifically with the very narrow point in amendment No. 273. We are not satisfied with his explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall have another brief attempt at explaining to the hon. Lady in my own words why, if she wants to establish a reputation for not opening up avoidance loopholes, she would be unwise to press the amendment, although I do not mind if she does so. When the control criterion is satisfied and there is a transfer of, for example, a property from one company in a group to another company in the group, and in return for that transfer an amount of money is paid from the subsidiary company to the upper company by way of a loan from a bank, that loan may go directly to the subsidiary company to pay for the intra-group property. Because that property would be an intra-group transfer it would not have to pay stamp duty on the transfer, assuming that the control total is satisfied. In that company, which might have been set up for the purpose, there would be one asset consisting of the property and one liability consisting of the bank loan. If the bank then took over the company, the cost of that company would be negligible because the value of the asset would equate with the value of the loan. It would have to pay hardly anything for it and no stamp duty thereon. However, when it acquired the company, it would extinguish the loan to the company—a loan owed to itself—and end up with the full value of the property without having had to pay stamp duty on the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady may say that a bank would not do such a thing and she may be more trusting of banking organisations than many who have long experience of them, but a bank could do that. If it wanted to acquire a headquarters building for its own use, that would be a way for it legally to avoid paying stamp duty on it. But that is
	<span class='label label-info column'>622</span>
not the only reason why we are worried about such cases. It would also be possible for a bank to make a back-to-back transaction or for such a transaction to be camouflaged or opaque. I hope that the hon. Lady and my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne will agree that that is not satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say to the Committee, somewhat gratuitously because I have discussed the matter with my officials, that I am not satisfied with aspects of the law and think that it is appropriate to reconsider it. The provision is right and sound, but I can envisage certain problems. In the example that I gave, it would be acceptable for a bank to lend a general unsecured loan to that company. In those circumstances, what I have described could happen without stamp duty being paid. That would not be welcome. Although it is unlikely that an unsecured general loan would be granted from a bank to a company, not necessarily to purchase a property, but when the only asset is that property, it is not difficult to envisage that private arrangements could be made that would extinguish that loan and affect the transfer of the property without liability to stamp duty. I want to reconsider that carefully and hopefully, speedily, to discover whether the provision needs to be tightened. As far as I am aware, it is not used for avoidance and my concerns, expressed gratuitously as I have said, might not arise. I give that assurance to emphasise that the Government are keen to ensure that avoidance loopholes do not occur. Those people who rightly have an obligation to pay stamp duty should not avoid it improperly. I hope that I have addressed the hon. Lady's point and reassured her.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
