	<i>Amendment proposed</i>—[
	<i>6th May</i>]—No. 44, in page 4, line 17, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'; and in determining whether to make an order the court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including, in particular, whether the debtor has made a full disclosure of his affairs, whether he has been adjudged bankrupt on a previous occasion, the number and nature of his debts and whether his bankruptcy would for any reason be a matter of public concern'.—[Mr. 
	<i>Clinton Davis.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are also taking Amendment No. 42, in page 4, line 30, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>' The Secretary of State shall by order prescribe the matters which are to be taken into account by the Court in deciding whether to exercise the powers given to it in and by subsection (1) of this section t.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Terence Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. At the last sitting, the Under-Secretary referred to a somewhat mysterious document. It would be helpful if he could let the Committee know exactly what this paper says and, in particular, the date and whether it was presented to Ministers. I understand that it may not be possible for him to give us an answer immediately, but if he would at some later stage in the proceedings clarify this matter, since it seems relevant to what we are discussing, it would be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Clinton Davis)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. English. The document is confidential because it affects the internal working of the Department. It was presented in or about February 1972. I am not sure whether it was considered by Ministers in the then Government. I thought, as I said previously, that if we
	<span class='label label-info column'>208</span>
as a Government are seeking to take steps which would improve the efficacy of the Insolvency Service, it would be futile for me not to have sight of the document, which goes to the very heart of the running of that service. No political interest was involved in the document, but I do not think it would be helpful if the confidentiality were to be breached beyond that. I know it is a somewhat difficult matter but I hope that the hon. Gentleman, with his experience of Government, will recognise the difficulty that I am placed in. No doubt he and I can have discussions about it subsequently which may help to erase the difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. Perhaps that may be a helpful way of dealing with it, but the thing that concerns me is that it is a well-established convention that papers presented to one Administration are not transferred to the next. Of course the material may well be the same and officials may then decide to re-present it to the incoming Government in some other form, but actually to present the same document is, as far as I am aware, a somewhat unorthodox procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seemed particularly curious that the Under-Secretary should now argue on the one hand that there was nothing political in it and it did not matter and, on the other hand, that it was something which was confidential and cannot now be shown to the Committee. There seems a certain inconsistency in those two lines of argument, but no doubt he will wish to make further inquiries and perhaps favour the Committee with another statement on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the last point is certainly one for the hon. Gentleman to discuss with the Minister and not a point to raise here. Upon the question of the production of the document, the Minister did not quote from it and therefore is not bound to lay it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Percival</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first say a word on the point raised by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Darwen (Mr. Charles Fletcher-Cooke) at the last sitting, when he referred to the importance of matters being in public rather than in private? He referred to the interests of the Press in ensuring that hearings are in public and of the creditors and debtors
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1068">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>209</span>
and so on. I think there was some suggestion in what my hon. and learned Friend was saying that the effect of Clause 5 would be to remove a particular procedure from public gaze into a private hearing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must confess that I was not very clear myself after my hon. and learned Friend had raised the point as to whether that might not be the effect of Clause 5. However, I have done a bit more homework on it and my conclusion is—I hope that the Minister will be able to confirm this because it might give cause for concern if people thought that what we were doing was making a hearing private which had previously been public—that that is not the effect of Clause 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of Clause 5 is to cut out that stage in the proceedings altogether. A public examination is an identifiable stage in the proceedings. We are cutting it out and not, as might have been supposed from our discussion last time, removing that examination from the public gaze into a private hearing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, when we adjourned our last sitting, I was arguing that Amendment No. 42 should be preferred to Amendment No. 44. I have given further consideration to that argument, and I want to tell the Committee straight away that I do not pursue it by and large. I will tell the Committee quite frankly why. I think that what was influencing me was the importance of getting these criteria right. Whether they will be stated in the Bill or in statutory instruments or in the bankruptcy rules laid under the present procedure, they must be right. I do not think anybody would quarrel with that proposition. I think I was afriad that we might not get them right before the Bill was passed. That was at the back of my mind in saying " Let us do it by statutory instrument " because that would give us a little longer to think about it and more time to get it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that was wholly the proper approach, although I think that the first half of the approach is right—we must have these criteria correct. But the corollary is that we must have them correct before this Bill becomes law so that they may appear on the face of it for all to see and may be scrutinised and passed by Parliament in all the remaining stages of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>210</span>
I shall therefore confine myself now to the question of what the criteria should be, and I shall say no more about Amendment No. 42. Everything else I have to say is directed to Amendment No. 44. At the moment, on the face of the record as it stands, there appears to be considerable inconsistency in the argument advanced by the Minister. It arises in this way. The Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is one of the major points of substance which arise."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>Standing Committee C,</i> 6th May, 1976; c. 195.]</p></blockquote>
That was how he opened the debate on Amendment No. 44 to Clause 5. Of course it is enormcusly important. We are—and I do not think that I had realised this when we started on the Bill as much as I do now—here introducing a departure or a method of departing from a practice which has been almost absolute and an essential part of the bankruptcy proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until now, as was said at Thursday's sitting, the only grounds upon which a public examination could be dispensed with were not logical or rational grounds but grounds of mercy or health—a point then made by my hon. and learned Friend. Now it is proposed to depart altogether from that and to adopt a different principle that there may be logical grounds why an order for public examination may be dispensed with. We all accept that departure, which is of itself a big one, and all we are discussing now is the way in which the power to be given to the court to dispense with public examination should be exercised. That is the first reason why I agree with him that this matter is of major importance. It represents a big departure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is and my hon. and learned Friend will know it but not every member of the Committee may know it as he and I know it—that, when one is dealing with legislation of the kind we are discussing, we are not dealing with some sort of general provisions that may or may not come into effect at some future time. Let us take, for example, pieces of legislation such as the Race Relations Act—the extent to which they may affect people's lives and the speed with which they may do so may be doubtful. But here we are laying down new practices which must be followed by all who are concerned in the practice of bankruptcy the minute this Bill becomes law, so they really have to stand all the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1069">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>211</span>
tests to which they should be subjected before we pass them and before we oblige all those who practice in this field to adopt these new practices and procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had many references to a wider review. I think it has been said and if it has not, it will be said before we finish that further consideration of what we are talking about now will form a part of the wider review. If I may digress for a moment, I hope that at some stage, since there have been so many references to the wider review and the fact that we can leave this, that and the other to it, we may be told whether it has started and, if so, what progress it has made and what is the planning for it, because that is relevant to how important it is to any particular discussion. I leave it there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that there may be a wider review does not affect what we are discussing here. What we are discussing here comes into law the moment we pass it. The official receivers and all other people concerned have then to study it and to say "We know we have to do something different; what it is different that we now have to do?" Therefore, we must get it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister has indicated that there will be further guidance in the rules to be made under other parts of the bankruptcy law. I take the view that, though that is relevant to what we are discussing, it is more of a "clause stand part" matter, because it forms part of the background against which one must view the effects of the clause after we have made such amendments, if any, as will be made. Therefore, I say no more about that at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second factor in this apparent inconsistency is that the Minister says that we are doing something here of major importance, and I agree. But then he went on to say
	<br><blockquote><p>"… it is not expected that many "—</p></blockquote>
that is many bankruptcies—
	<br><blockquote><p>"will warrant an application for dispensation of the public examination."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>Standing Committee C,</i> 6th May 1976; c. 198.]</p></blockquote>
If it will not affect very many cases, is it as important as the Minister says, or, alternatively, if what has been devised in this amendment would have the result that there would be an application to dispense in only a few cases, does what
	<span class='label label-info column'>212</span>
we are doing do justice to the importance of the subject?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is convenient here to analyse what we have to discuss in this way. In general terms, we have to make up our minds what we want to do and then whether this amendment will achieve it. One can be a little more specific than that, and I pose and will seek to answer these questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do we or do we not wish to see a significant reduction in the number of public examinations? That must be the first question. The second must be whether the criteria contained in Amendment No. 44 will produce that result. The third question is, if not, what criteria should we substitute for them, or what variations in the criteria set out in Amendment No. 44 ought we to consider?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My answer to the first question is an unqualified "Yes." I believe that that is the answer of the majority of practitioners in this field. On this subject, the report published by a committee of Justice on bankruptcy in 1975 goes into great detail on the practice, the advantages, the disadvantages, the balance which one is trying to hold and so on. I shall make one or two references to it, but I recommend the whole of this part of the Justice report to all members of the Committee, because it is so thorough that it is most useful. Also, the attention which it gives to this question, the dispensing with the public examination, indicates the degree of importance attached to the subject. That subject begins at paragraph 41 of the report and continues through to paragraph 56.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me mention two of the reasons to which it refers for thinking that it could be a good thing to bring about a significant reduction in the number of public examinations. Paragraph 49 on page 19 of the report begins:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Committee has considered a number of arguments the impact of which either individually or taken together is claimed to warrant the complete abolition of the public examination and they can be summarised as follows."</p></blockquote>
I draw the Committee's attention to the first two. The first, (a), states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The examination is frequently no more than a formality, a waste of time and quite unnecessary in that it elicits no information or no useful information beyond that which is already known to Official Receiver."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1070">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>213</span>
I think we all agree that in that category of case we should try to ensure that this step, which, as is said there, proves to be no more than a formality, ought to be cut out. Then subparagraph (b) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is unjustifiably costly, in particular, having regard to the time and energy devoted to its preparation by the Official Receiver and his staff, on the one hand, and the lack of any worthwhile information obtained thereby, on the other, both in relation to the recovery of assets and regarding the true causes of the bankrupt's failure."</p></blockquote>
I read these two because I think they are particularly relevant to the kind of points advanced by both sides of the Committee as being typical of what we are trying to achieve here. We want to cut out anything which is a waste of time, not only for the broad reason that there is no point in subjecting anybody to something which is a waste of time, but, more particularly, because of the demands which it makes upon the Insolvency Service. That is why I have quoted the reason set out in (b), because in the Bill we are trying particularly to cut down the burden on the Insolvency Service, without, so far as we can, lowering the standard of the remedy available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that in many of the cases that come within either of the categories referred to in subparagraphs (a) or (b) one of the reasons why it should be no more than a formality and unjustifiably costly in terms of the services of the Insolvency Service would be because it was a very small case and, in view of the amounts involved subject to examination, top-heavy, and became no more than a formality because there was nothing to be discovered. It is in the small cases in particular that one finds the amount of time spent by those in the Insolvency Service in relation to the possible benefits may also be top-heavy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure the Minister will agree that one cannot say that it is only in the cases where the amounts are small that those consequences follow. I am learning quite a bit about bankruptcy. I gather that within the trade bankruptcies are divided into three categories. Everyone thinks in terms of little ones, medium-sized and big ones, but in addition to that they think of three other categories—the category which could be called misfortune; the kind which one would castigate as improvidence rather than misfortune; and the kind where there is reprehensible
	<span class='label label-info column'>214</span>
conduct of one kind or another. The view is generally taken that in that kind of bankruptcy which is the result of misfortune, whether the amount is great or small, there is not likely to be much to be gained from a public examination because nothing is likely to be discovered which could not be discovered by other means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are two instances of the reasons frequently advanced for doing away with public examinations, at least in a significant number of cases. The rest are set out in some detail in those passages of the Justice report to which I have referred. But, of course, following that, Justice then goes on to point out the very reasons why there should be a public examination. Particularly in the cases where fraud is suspected or any conduct of a reprehensible nature, it may well be that the public examination, where the debtor is on oath and is cross-examined by the counsel for the Official Receiver and counsel for other creditors, is one of the best ways in which the true facts may be elicited. It is all a question of balance between the advantages and disadvantages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to tell the Committee a little about the other procedures which are involved in bankruptcy proceedings because that will help us to get the right balance. If the public examination were the only or even the main way of eliciting information, it would be a very serious step to do away with it. But in fact the processes are such that even before one reaches the stage of public examination a number of other steps have been taken, which in any case which did not have unusual features would probably elicit most of what needed to be elicited, and would certainly give the experts in the case the " feel " of whether this was a case in which a public examination was necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that it all starts with a bankruptcy notice, and if that is not complied with there is the petition and a hearing. If the hearing is successful, a receiving order is made. From then on, the person against whom the receiving order is made is very much obliged to put himself and his information at the disposal of the Official Receiver. This is one of the respects in which bankruptcy is so much more effective than administration orders, to which we shall come later, because
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>215</span>
in bankruptcy the Official Receiver has such a strong position 
	<i>vis-a-vis</i> the bankrupt once the receiving order has been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In case hon. Gentlemen are not aware of it, the first thing that happens is that an examiner, who spends his whole time examining, then examines the bankrupt, or person against whom the receiving order has been made. I am assured that that is always a very thorough examination. At the same time, the Official Receiver has advertised for other creditors, and though they cannot take part in the examination, when they see the advertisement calling for other creditors to inform the Official Receiver of the money owed to them, they can write to him and I am told that he pays great attention to all such communications. The examiner then follows up any leads given in those communications. The likely next step is a first meeting of creditors, and at this there will be considerable scope for discussing the sort of matters which should have a bearing on whether it is necessary for the matter to proceed to a public examination. After that, the Official Receiver applies for an adjudication under Section 18, so that is another occasion on which the effects are gone into, albeit perhaps not very fully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not as though those of us who are saying that public examinations should be ruled out in a substantial number of cases are advocating a line of action which would cut down the investigatory processes as much as one might imagine if one thought that was the only substantial occasion on which there was an opportunity to carry out an investigation into the assets and conduct of the bankrupt. As I hope I have indicated to the Committee in that brief resume, there are in the ordinary processes of the bankruptcy all those stages in which relevant information can be obtained and considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to my second point. If we simply add to the Bill the criteria contained in Amendment No. 44, will that reduce the number of public examinations significantly? Here I am rather in the dark. I invite the Minister to take us into his confidence here and tell us a little more of his thinking. How does his Department see this working? On what sort of analysis is his forecast based? By this I mean when he said it was not
	<span class='label label-info column'>216</span>
expected that many cases will warrant an application to dispense. I am informed by the profession that that is also its view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am speaking in general terms now because I intend this as a form of inquiry for information both from the Committee and the profession, but the profession feels reinforced by what the Minister said, that if we passed Clause 5, merely amended to add these criteria, we should be putting a new work load on to official receivers because they would then have to consider in every case what they should do under Clause 5. The profession also think that this conclusion would be in most cases, if these are the criteria, that he should not apply for an order to dispense, and, further, that, if he did, the number of cases in which an order might be made would be small. It would help the profession and us if the Minister would expand a little on the reasons why he takes the view that he expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress the importance of the point. Clause 5, new Clause 4—let me assume for the moment that it is likely to be selected—and Clause 6 would all be interlocking, because one of the conditions which would bring new Clause 4 into operation would be that an order had been made to dispense with public examinations. One of the conditions which would prevent Clause 6 from operating would be that an order had been made under new Clause 4 (1). If the Minister is right that very few orders would be made dispensing with a public examination, it would follow that there would be very few cases in which the court could make an order under subsection (1) (
	<i>b</i>) of new Clause 4, and therefore very few cases in which the operation of Clause 6, the automatic review, would be excluded by reason of the dispensing with the public examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me proceed to the third question on the basis that both the Minister and the professions are right in saying that the criteria as at present set would not result in many dispensations for the public examination. If that is right, I think we are doing the wrong thing. I have already expressed the view which I hold and which the professions hold more strongly, and for better reasons than I do, that if this is to be useful it ought to produce the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1072">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>217</span>
result that a considerable number of public examinations are dispensed with. What should we do then?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here I want to fly some kites which is what the Committee stage is for. I want to hear what the Minister and his advisers have to say about the various possibilities which have been discussed in different places and implemented in other places, and I will shortly give him an outline of what I think are the main possibilities which the Committee and the House ought to consider and on which we should like the benefit of his advice and views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Second Reading Committee, I referred to two other possible approaches. At our meeting last Thursday, the Minister said that I had suggested that one or other of these should be adopted. Looking at the record, I do not think I actually suggested that; I did not mean to. What I was saying was that they ought to be considered. One of them was that there should automatically be no public examination unless an order was made for one. It is not necessary to pursue that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have looked at the Minister's argument at our last sitting that where every public examination is made to depend upon an application, as distinct from the other way round, it is possible that this will increase the number of applications or that there will then be more applications than there would be if it were done the other way round. That is the argument that he expounded in column 198. I will not pursue it in any more detail, because I accept the substance of it; therefore, I do not suggest that that possibility should be pursued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there are several others which ought to be pursued. One is the recommendation put forward by Justice in paragraph 55 of the report to which I have already referred. The relevant parts are as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Committee feels that in all cases where the unsecured liabilities disclosed by the debtor in his Statement of Affairs exceed £10,000 he should be obliged to give an explanation in public to account for his failure."</p></blockquote>
If we adopted that as a criterion, it would nave several highly desirable effects, all centred on this—there would then be no argument in cases above £10,000, whereas under the criteria we are suggesting, however big, the question would still have to be considered whether there should
	<span class='label label-info column'>218</span>
be an application to dispense. Justice has said that in every case over £10,000, which is still quite a lot of money, there ought to be a public examination. Therefore, we will not give the power to dispense in cases where the debts are over £10,000. When one does that, one has done justice to some of the principles referred to by the Minister himself on Thursday when he said that he desired to see the public examination continued in the case of substantial bankruptcies. I agree with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Accordingly the Committee recommends that in such cases a public examination should always be held. On the other hand, in cases where the unsecured liabilities disclosed by the debtor …are less than £10,000, the Committee recommends that the law should be altered and that there should be no public examination unless (i) the court is satisfied upon the application of the Official Receiver, the trustee in bankruptcy or a creditor, that such a hearing should take place, or (ii) the debtor has been bankrupt on a previous occasion."</p></blockquote>
The second of those criteria, that the debtor has been bankrupt on a previous occasion, is in line with the thinking of the Minister and the criteria he has put forward, and, if one put it as bluntly as that, it would cut out another category which ought to be cut out, without anybody having to go into the detail of it. One would simply say, "This is a second bankruptcy; therefore there has to be a public examination."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that this would entail the making of an application by someone who wanted there to be a public examination in a case where the debts were under £10,000 but it was a first bankruptcy. So the Minister's argument about increasing the number of applications to the court if public examination were to be made dependent upon an application might have some force. However, one could easily cure that by saying in the criteria that the court "shall make the order to dispense unless it is satisfied upon the application "—and sc on—that such a hearing should take place. Then, instead of having somebody applying for an order for a public examination, one—would have this situation: save in the excepted cases, when the Official Receiver went to court asking for an order dispensing with the public examination, the effect of the criteria would be that the court should make that order unless someone
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1073">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>219</span>
else satisfied the court that there ought to be a public examination. That would meet the point made by the Minister in c. 198.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may well have been some of the thinking behind the practice which is adopted in Australia. Some details of it are to be found in paragraph 47 (
	<i>a</i>) cf the Justice report, on page 18:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In Australia a public examination takes place in every case except in small bankruptcies, i.e. where it appears to the court that the bankrupt's liabilities do not exceed 4,000 Australian dollars."</p></blockquote>
At the time of the publication of the report, that was £2,268. I think it is now considerably more. It is interesting to note what the Australians consider to be a small bankruptcy. It is not a bankruptcy of the £200 or £300 order; they consider a small one to be one under what is now about £3,000 sterling. Thus far, it is rather on the lines of the Justice report, except that they have taken a figure of £3,000 instead of £10,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this side of the Committee, f 10,000 is not advanced as a magical figure, nor is it by Justice. It is taken as a figure in a line-drawing exercise, saying that above a certain figure there should be a public examination in every case, and if the Government thought the figure of £10,000 was too high, any arguments they might like to advance directed to that point would receive the most full consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How do they then deal with the small ones in Australia, those under about £3,000? The paragraph goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In such cases there is no public examination unless a creditor, by notice in writing to the trustee, requires such an examination to be held or the trustee is of the opinion that such an examination ought to be held'."</p></blockquote>
The interesting thing is that in Australia they have avoided the danger to which the Minister referred in Clause 198, because no application to the court is necessary. Therefore, the way in which they deal with it does not impose any extra burden either upon the Insolvency Service or upon the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"there is no public examination ' unless a creditor, by notice in writing to the trustee, requires such an examination to be held or the trustee is of the opinion that such an examination ought to be held '".</p></blockquote>
In either of those events such a public examination is held. That package reduces very substantially the number of public examinations because in any case
	<span class='label label-info column'>220</span>
of under about £3,000 there will be no public examination unless someone takes the initiative to obtain one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people do things just for the sake of doing them, to be nasty, which is one of the reasons argued against public examinations where they are not acceptable. Some people use them to smear others, but on the whole people would not take action to require a public examination unless they had good reason to do so—I think that is a reasonable assumption to make. That fact has resulted in very substantial reduction in the number of public examinations in Australia. The Act to which I refer, which I am sure hon. Members will know, is the Bankruptcy Act (Australia) 1966, Sections 69, 185 and 186.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In New Zealand, the matter is dealt with in a different way. I do not put this forward as the answer to everything, but I should be interested to know what the Minister thinks of it, and in particular why he thinks that it is inferior to what he is proposing in Amendment No. 44. I quote from paragraph 47(b) of the Justice report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In New Zealand section 69 of the Insolvency Act 1967 provides that if the assignee, at any time after adjudication and before the making of any absolute Order of Discharge, files in the court a statement to the effect that it is desirable that the bankrupt should submit to a public examination, or if the creditors, at any meeting before the making of an absolute Order of Discharge, pass an ordinary resolution to the like effect, and a copy of the resolution certified by the assignee or chairman is filed in the court, then a public examination shall take place."</p></blockquote>
This has something in common with the first suggestion that I floated in Second Reading Committee. There, the law is that there is no public examination unless something happens. It also meets the argument put forward by the Minister in Clause 198, because it does not involve any application. It is different from the Australian system because there is no difference between great and small, but it works more like it in the sense that it starts with the proposition that there will be no public examination at all, which goes further than the Australian one, but it is similar to the Australian provisions for small bankruptcies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It then goes on to say that if the assignee does a certain thing, there shall be a public examination, or if the creditors pass an ordinary resolution to a certain effect, there shall be one. Again it avoids the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1074">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>221</span>
burden on the service and the courts, but it has the effect of a significant decrease in the number of public examinations because one can assume that the assignee will not file in the court a statement to the effect that it is desirable that the bankrupt should submit to a public examination unless he really feels that there is good cause for so doing. All the odds are that he will file such a statement on far fewer occasions and in less than the majority of cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Likewise, it is very unlikely that the creditors will pass an ordinary resolution to the like effect unless there is good reason for it, whereas if it depended on only one creditor, he might want to have a public examination for reasons of spite best known to himself. Where it depends on the passing of a resolution by a meeting of the creditors, it is very much less likely to be taken without good cause. The Minister indicates doubt. There may be exceptions; I accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. and learned Gentleman has been to creditors' meetings, as I have. If he has, he could perhaps sense the feeling that pervades some of those meetings and the considerations that are applied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I have never been to one, I am happy to say. I am likely only to go to my own, and I hope there will not be one. As the hon. Gentleman knows, I have the benefit in the work of this Committee of the advice and experience of those who are at it all the time, and I am expressing their view. Certainly, there are some pretty nasty creditors about, but on the whole the creditors are taking action to obtain their money and do not want either the delay or the expense of a public examination unless it produces some money. There are some creditors who will act out of spite or b-mindedness, but on the whole they are perfectly reasonable, ordinary people, activated only by practical considerations. Therefore, it is felt that such provisions as those that have been introduced in New Zealand would have the effects I have postulated, speaking generally. My advice is that that is what has happened in New Zealand.
	<span class='label label-info column'>222</span>
Since the Insolvency Act was passed in New Zealand in 1967, these changes have worked rather well. That is a matter on which the Minister is in a much better position to form a view than I am. I am in quite a good position to have one, because those who give me this advice are in contact with people who practise in a similar field, not only in the Commonwealth, but in America. They express the view that both Australia and New Zealand are well pleased with the innovations they introduced in 1967.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is right, I should have thought it was a powerful reason for having a closer look at them than we have done so far. If it is right that they are pretty well pleased with them, it would also be very interesting to know what they have found wrong with them. It would not be necessary for us to be wedded slavishly to either of those schemes; we should be able, if we take the necessary time and trouble, to pick the best of either or both of them and avoid the pitfalls which either or both of them have experienced in the ten and nine years respectively in which they have been in operation in their respective countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are four other possibilities which merit discussion and consideration. We should like to hear the Minister's views about them, what discussions he has had about them, and what representations he has had. It would be interesting to know what discussions he had about the ones that are contained in Amendment No. 44, but a discussion is really only of any value when it consists of comparing one thing with other possibilities, which is what I have been trying to do. Then one really gets down to brass tacks as to what is the best thing to do. Has he had any representations from anybody? The possibilities in Amendment No. 44 are very good—they could be readily implemented. Or has he had any representations that some others were preferable?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall finish where I started. All that I have said is in the spirit of, first, accepting that it is an improvement to have the criteria laid down by law. Secondly, I have accepted that it is better that they should be laid down in a statute rather than by statutory instrument. Thirdly, we should not be mesmerised by a first draft. We ought to regard Amendment No. 44 as a first draft, and in the Committee compare what is contained in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1075">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>223</span>
Amendment No. 44 with some of the alternatives which are worthy of consideration. I hope the Minister will help us fully on all those matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke) have already spelled out in considerable detail our doubts about this amendment and the amendment related to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make a simple drafting point. The way in which Amendment No. 44 now appears—and it is right that the criteria should be set out—is as an ordinary sentence with commas in it. The Minister has provided in the other amendment, No. 42,that the Secretary of State may, by order, prescribe the criteria, and that, I assume, means may amend it. It would have been more helpful if the amendment we are now considering had been set out in the form of 1, 2, 3 and 4 as the various considerations which are to be taken into account: that is to say, the first one, obviously, is
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether the debtor has made a full disclosure …"</p></blockquote>
the second one—
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether he has been adjudged bankrupt on a previous occasion …"</p></blockquote>
the third—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the number and nature of his debts …"</p></blockquote>
and the fourth—
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether his bankruptcy would for any reason be a matter of public concern".</p></blockquote>
If we are going to consider these, as my hon. and learned Friend has suggested, as a first draft, or at any rate, if the Bill becomes an Act, the first attempt at it which may subsequently be amended, it would be more helpful to have set it out in a 1, 2, 3 and 4 format than in a single paragraph—particularly so as it may sometimes be convenient in discussion or operation of the clause, if the amendment is accepted, to refer to criterion 1, 2, 3 or 4, whatever it may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Darwen set out the main considerations why it might be desirable for public examinations to take place, and pointed out that it may be that both creditors and debtors may gain or lose from not having a public examination. I have a tendency, when
	<span class='label label-info column'>224</span>
speaking to the Committee about my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Southport, to feel that he is tending to appear for the creditors and I for the debtors. I am not entirely sure that that is always so and on a number of points he has convinced me that my approach here is biased in the wrong direction—certainly on the actual limits we were discussing earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true, as my hon. and learned Friend has said, that one can get nasty creditors. I am not at all sure it is a bad thing that that should be a matter which becomes apparent in public rather than in private. There is a number of reasons why there is a strong case for public examinations rather than private examinations taking place, and if we are to change the law in this respect it is very important that we get the criteria right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, the argument the other way is one of economy. I hope the Minister can provide us with some estimates of the figures of how many cases will now be held in private rather than in public on the criteria which he has set down before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Might I now consider some of those which the Minister has suggested? The first one he suggests in his amendment is
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether the debtor has made a full disclosure of his affairs …".</p></blockquote>
I presume it may be apparent that he is refusing to make a full disclosure of his affairs, in which case that will be taken into account and it may well be decided that a public hearing should take place. I am not at all clear how it is to be decided whether he has made a full disclosure of his affairs because, presumably, if he has not, it is not quite clear that he has not done so. It may be clear if he refuses, but if he does not refuse and appears to be going on with it, that may be a matter of great obscurity. Perhaps the Minister would comment on that difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second one—
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether he has been adjudged bankrupt on a previous occasion …"</p></blockquote>
is obviously more straightforward. The only question is whether it ought to be a quite definite rule that if he has previously been adjudged bankrupt he should always have a public examination and whether there should be any discretion on that matter. The third one—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the number and nature of his debts …"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1076">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>225</span>
presumably includes size but, as my hon. and learned Friend suggested, it may well be that a more specific criterion could be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The criterion which the Minister has introduced and which seems to me to be most difficult is the last of those specified in the amendment,
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether his bankruptcy would for any reason be a matter of public concern."</p></blockquote>
I am far from clear whether those who are going to be responsible for taking decisions on these matters will really be in a position to decide whether a matter of public concern arises. I am not sure what this means—whether it is to be in the broadest possible political context, the economic context, the moral context or whatever. The inclusion of the words "for any reason" seems to be very broad indeed and would seem to be beyond the competence of those who have to make the decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point which we need to consider is whether additional criteria of the kind which my hon. and learned Friend has suggested ought to be included, and I hope that the Minister can comment on those because although it may be possible on a prayer to discuss the matter later if it is amended by order on this occasion—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hope that the Minister will give us a forthcoming reply, and will provide some of the estimates and arguments which will convince us either that this provision should be accepted as it is or that there is room for further improvement. If we make what is, after all, a major change in our proceedings, we
	<span class='label label-info column'>226</span>
should do so on a sensible basis rather than an arbitrary one. I particularly hope that he will comment on the drafting point that I made. That would be helpful to the future of the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with the point made by the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) as to the form in which this provision is set out. I shall certainly look at that. I shall not give an undertaking to the Committee—I do not think that he expected me to do that. But there may be something in what he says. I shall also come back to the other matters to which he alluded because these were raised in one form or another by the hon. and learned Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke) at our last sitting, and more specifically—and perhaps rather more lengthily—by the hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had, of course, very long meetings to consider the approach to this matter. I agree with the hon. and learned Member for Southport that essentially, at the end of the day, it is a balance of judgment. But I also came to the conclusion that, whether one approached it from the point of view of Justice, or from the original point of view postulated by my officials, the end product was not likely to be substantially different. They started, in a way, from differing points of view but, in practice, when one has regard to the various criteria that have to be applied, at the end of the day the number of public examinations would not be very much altered, whichever approach one applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to another point, to which I shall come back. I am sorry that the hon. and learned Member for Southport is not here. It puts me at something of a disadvantage because he has a legal expertise which the hon. Member for Worthing would recognise is valuable
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1077">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>227</span>
to him. It is difficult, therefore, to speak about these matters in his absence. Nevertheless, I shall have to try.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In applying the various criteria that the hon. and learned Gentleman has put forward—in his own words, he has floated a number of kites—I am in the difficulty that I cannot possibly give any prognosis of what the situation would be if one applied solution A, solution B or solution C. The Australian and New Zealand experiments have fundamental objections which I do not like. Therefore, I am not disposed to graft these proposals into the English law. If there are fundamental objections, there is no point in carrying out a detailed analysis of the result of applying the criteria that they have. Therefore I cannot give any indication of what the effect would be, any more than I did at the last sitting, when I said that I expected that there would not be an enormous impact on the number of public examinations. I still think that is right. I think the Justice committee shares that view, as the hon. and learned Member for Southport said. But I do not see that there is any possibility of arriving at an analysis or a prognosis which will be of any value to the Committee at this stage. The hon. and learned Gentleman may wish to respond to that, though I hope he will not wish to do so at length.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the Minister is now saying that the criteria which he has proposed would not result in an enormous reduction in the number of public hearings. I should have thought—again speaking as a layman--that quite a large percentage of the total number of cases would be cases where the debtor had apparently made a full disclosure, where he evidently had not been declared bankrupt before, where the nature of his debts was small and simple and where there was no matter of public concern. I am therefore rather suprised that the Minister does not think that there would be a great reduction in the number of public hearings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think so; I shall try to deal with that argument in a moment. That view was also held by the hon. and learned Member for Southport. It was also the view of Justice and, I think, of The Law Society. I would go further and say that even if the alternative view were postulated—leaving aside Australia
	<span class='label label-info column'>228</span>
and New Zealand, which I will deal with later—I do not think it would make very much difference. That is my conclusion on the matter, having consulted widely on these points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman started by seeking to rectify a point which had been made by the hon. and learned Member for Darwen, that there would be some sort of proliferation of private, rather than public, hearings. I entirely agree with his observations on it. That is not the intention at all and it will not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman also for accepting the purpose of Amendment No. 42 and the advantages to be gained from it. He then went on to postulate three questions. The first was: do we wish to see a significant reduction in the number of public examinations? That was essentially the point that was being made from an entirely different angle by his hon. and learned Friend at the last sitting, when he said that we should adhere to the present law. I tend, on balance, to agree with the hon. and learned Member for Southport that if there is waste in public examination, if unnecessary expense is being incurred, if unnecessary trauma is being caused to debtors, we should try to get away from the public examination concept. What we are talking about is the area where it is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt at all that the present situation, particularly for debtors who have suffered from misfortune or improvidence, can be a very trying one. Nobody likes to go to court and nobody likes to be exposed to questioning, even if the questioning is not very detailed or profound. The atmosphere and the whole aura of court proceedings frightens people, and I dare say that that also has an effect in causing people at the present time not to want to go back to court for a second time to apply for their discharge. That point has been made by Justice, and I have a great deal of sympathy with it. What we must try to do is to determine how we segregate the cases where there is a measure of culpability attaching to the bankrupt. Really, that is the most difficult issue we have to face and the most difficult question we have to answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find this to some extent a perplexing problem, and I think there can be no doubt that the hon. and learned Gentleman
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1078">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>229</span>
did. He was busy flying a lot of kites. I would not go to Hampstead Heath with him to fly a kite because I think he would take rather a long time in getting it up. Perhaps that is a little unfair; it is just that as the Minister waiting to get on with the Bill, may have got that impression. But he made a rather valuable point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to see that the hon. Gentleman said that with a smile on his face, but the smile would not be on the record. I am sure that he would agree that as much he wants to get on with his Bill, it is much more important to get the Bill right, and that is one of the matters to which our discussions so far have been directed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. I think that we carry on the debates without animus and in a good spirit, and I have an overriding concern to get the Bill right, though with some measure of rapidity as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How does one identify and categorise the cases where the culpability of the debtor is more marked than in other cases? I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman addressed his mind wholly to that essential question, though I shall certainly look carefully at what he said when I read the 
	<i>Official Report.</i> If we do not get the answer to that question right, it will be very difficult to get the Bill right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we have tried to do is to eliminate the relatively trivial cases from the procedure altogether. There has been a difference of view between the two sides of the Committee on that. I think—and I emphasise the point again in this context—that the approach we have made of increasing the monetary limits is likely to reduce substantially the number of bankruptcies, and hence it will substantially reduce the number of public examinations. That, I should have thought, was basically an objective which was also sought by the Opposition. But the means of doing so have been substantially questioned by them. It is very difficult to see how we can go about tackling this problem, other than in the way we have done, and yet at the same time try to compartmentalise those cases to which a substantial measure of culpability is attached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman went on to talk about the adequacy or otherwise
	<span class='label label-info column'>230</span>
of the criteria to he applied, but I turn to the point about the £10,000 suggestion which has been made in the Justice leaflet. In paragraph 55 it says that—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Committee feels that in all cases where the unsecured liabilities disclosed by the debtor in his Statement of Affairs exceed £10,000"</p></blockquote>
the debtor should be obliged to be exposed to a public examination. I think it is very difficult to take an arbitrary monetary limit and then assume--which I think is the purpose there—that culpability is necessarily to be related to the amount of the liabilities of the debtor. Indeed, I think that if a figure such as £10,000 is taken there may be a danger—and I would ask the hon. and learned Gentleman to address himself to this point for a moment—that this could constitute an inducement to either understate or conceal liabilities on the part of the debtor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know what the full effect in Australia has been. I think it would be difficult to analyse the position there. How can the situation be analysed as to whether in a large number of cases or otherwise there has in practice been this understating or concealment of liabilities? I do not think we could arrive at any conclusion. That is a difficult one, and therefore f do not attach a great deal of significance to the postulating of a figure of £10,000—or any other figure, for that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the Australian and New Zealand legislation, and to the fundamental objection that I see in it. The hon. and learned Gentleman may or may not agree, but as far as I could see, he did not advert to it in his observations. In neither place does the court appear to have any discretion in the matter. I think that that is a fundamental objection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In New Zealand, quite apart from that, I feel that there is a real danger that there is simply a creditors' meeting which now has the power to make this requirement to pass an ordinary resolution that it is desirable that the bankrupt should submit to a public examination. Once it becomes desirable, I would think it is almost impossible to resist because there would be, not unnaturally, a feeling of great resentment if the substantial body of creditors were to be frustrated in implementing a recommendation in the form of a resolution that they had passed.

understandable reasons—at a creditors' meeting may not give a balanced judgment about these affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot dismiss from our consideration here the vindictiveness and the desire for vengeance that so naturally affect the judgment of creditors when they are dealing with a bankrupt's affairs at a meeting of this kind. I do not think it is a good idea, quite frankly, but, as I have said, the first objection that I have taken is more fundamental than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the next point in the speech made by the hon. and learned Gentleman. We are not very far apart because, if I may just interrupt my own thoughts, he identified the categories of misfortune, improvidence and culpability. Having identified them, with respect, he did not deal with the last one. That is a matter in respect of which there is a lacuna in the submission he made to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next point which the hon. and learned Gentleman made was about whether the criteria in Amendment No. 44 will produce the effect of reducing the number of public examinations. As I have already indicated, I cannot give any mathematical formula, for the reasons that I have given. I therefore just set out one or two general observations about it. The cases which are expected to result in bankruptcies following the raising of the monetary limit are, first, those where there are assets to justify the expense of the proceedings and, second, those with large liabilities to justify the investigatory procedure. It is probable that those in the latter category would fall into the criteria of
	<br><blockquote><p>"number and nature of his debts".</p></blockquote>
But that, of course, would follow, in effect, from the hon. and learned Gentleman's own criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the cases in the other category where there are assets, where the deficiency is small may have the public examination dispensed with, but in the others there is a likelihood that there would be large liabilities, too, and a public examination might be desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I think it important to look at the criteria, which I was invited to do by the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins). I shall go through the four essential criteria in the order in which they appear. First, has the debtor made a full disclosure of his affairs? In
	<span class='label label-info column'>232</span>
deciding whether he can apply to the court, the Official Receiver must determine that; nobody else can. If he has suspicions that the debtor is being less than full, frank and open with him, it is right that that debtor should be subjected to cross-exam i nation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, has the debtor been bankrupt before? I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman that there should be a definite rule regarding a previous bankruptcy. I think it must depend on when the bankruptcy occurred and the circumstances in which it occurred. Therefore, to make a definitive judgment about that in the statute would not be the right approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third criterion is indebtedness" the number and nature of his debts." This goes substantially along the lines of Justice, which wants to set a definite figure and says that £10,000 constitutes a substantial sum. That is the arbitrary figure which has been alighted on. That is not the only criterion, as I have already indicated. One ought to be able to look at the way in which those debts have been calculated. We ought to see whether there is a professional interest in these matters, although that would clearly fall under the fourth criterion, too. I just cite one example which comes to mind immediately. Has someone received money which might, in principle, go into a client's account, to be dealt with in that way in the form of some trust? This would be a consideration to which the Official Receiver ought to attach importance. Certainly, if a solicitor misuses his client account, I should have thought it desirable that there should be a public examination. That would, no doubt, have its effect on the mind of the Official Receiver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Public interest, or public concern, is a difficult concept, I entirely agree, but it is not novel. It is a term which has been used in a number of statutes in a wide variety of contexts. I am told that it appears in the Licensing (Consolidation) Act 1910, a statute which I need not trouble the Committee with because we are all so familiar with it, I am sure. Then there is Section 28 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947, which dealt with the withholding of documents on discovery by the Crown. The question of public interest arose there. if I remember aright, it appears, too, in the Immigration Act, in relation to determining whether the Home Secretary may cause somebody

	<span class='label label-info column'>233</span>
to be sent out of the United Kingdom because it may be in the public interest so to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12 noon</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is slipping from a matter of public conern to the public interest, as though the two were synonymous. Is it the fact that the wording in all the instances just cited refers to the public interest? There is a distinction between the two. If all the earlier wording is "the public interest," I am not clear why it has suddenly become "public concern."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because I think " public interest" is too narrow, and " public concern " should encompass the term " public interest". One has to have regard to this difficulty in bankruptcy. There can be a large number of permutations of the circumstances in which a court might be called upon to evaluate situations—in particular, whether to dispense with a public examination. It therefore becomes very difficult to define this term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be relevant in determining the public concern, that one had regard to the conduct of the debtor before and during the bankruptcy. One would have to have regard to the publicity afforded by the public examination. Would it or would it not yield a benefit to the creditors or to the public in general? One would have to have regard to the point I was making before—the professional status of the debtor. That would unquestionably have some effect on the nature of his obligations. Fourthly, would it highlight and prompt public awareness and discussion of some general principle which is exemplified by the bankruptcy?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not follow, therefore, that a wide number of the general public would have to be affected by the bankruptcy to involve matters of public concern. It could happen even if only a few people were involved, a few unfortunate clients of a solicitor who had behaved aberrantly in relation to his clients' moneys.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the difficulty. It is a general guideline that we are offering to the Official Receiver, and I do not think that one could be expected to do more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with the main points of substance dealt with by the hon. Gentleman and I have covered the points raised by
	<span class='label label-info column'>234</span>
the hon. and learned Member for South-port. This has been an interesting debate. I was particularly interested to listen to the criticisms of our proposals, because I am anxious to keep an open mind on these issues. I want to see the Bill in the best possible form, within the limitations that the present procedure enables us to apply. I say to the hon. and learned Gentleman now that if I were convinced that there was a strong case for departing from the criteria that we have set out in the Bill, I should certainly give it the most careful consideration. But I have not been so convinced this morning. As I say, he made an interesting speech, but he has not dealt with the kernel of the problem—the identification of those cases where there is a degree of culpability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the essence of the matter. If this is not tackled, I fail to see how the problem which he postulated in his speech can possibly be tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I hope that the Committee will feel that I have dealt fairly with the points which have been raised, and perhaps we can now proceed to the other matters which have to be dealt with in this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister that it has been a useful discussion. I part company with him slightly over something that he said at the end. I was inquiring. I was not seeking to put forward firm proposals, because my object was to have as full a discussion as one could of the alternatives before I personally made up my mind, or before my hon. Friend and I put our heads together and decided whether we should like any other form of wording—and if so, what. But I am obliged to the Minister for saying that he is ready to consider any specific proposals which we may put forward, and I assure him that the next stage, as far as we are concerned, will be to consider carefully what has been said today with a view to putting forward specific amendments to him, not waiting until Report. We shall put them before him for his consideration, if we form any such views, as quickly as we can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are one or two observations to be made on what my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) and the Minister have said. It is important that the Committee should appreciate, without any doubt, that we are not here turning a public examination
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1081">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>235</span>
into a private examination. We are cutting out a formal step in the proceedings altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens at the moment is that, after the petition, after the receiving order is made, there then is full examination by experts, absolutely in private, by the examiners. The public part is the advertisement by the Official Receiver of the receiving order and asking the creditors to call a meeting. The further occasion which is, one might say, part private and part public is the meeting of creditors. It is public in the sense that any creditor is entitled to attend it, but it is in private in that they discuss matters of interest to them in private.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is the adjudication, and then, at the moment, we automatically have the formal step of public examination, if that is how we interpret Section 15. It is a special formal step in the proceedings. At the moment it is automatic. What we are all aiming at is not to cut it out altogether but to see that it takes place only where it is needed. It is a question on which we have to try to agree how to postulate the criteria which enable the court to decide when it is needed or where it is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that the Minister was not able to tell us more about the Australian and New Zealand experience—not about their systems, because we know about that, but about their experience in working their systems, in the one case for 10 years, in the other for nine years. He takes me to task for not having dealt with the kernel of the question, that is, how to determine the cases where there is culpability. That, of course, is exactly what the Australian and New Zealand Governments were addressing their minds to. How should they decide when there should be a public examination? What provisions should they introduce for getting at the kernel of the question where are the cases where there is culpability, and where there should be a public examination? I should like to know what their experience has been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I still suggest to the Minister and his team that it is not too late to ascertain it. It may well be that they—by " they " I mean the appropriate Government Departments in Australia and New Zealand, have had some interim reports and they may say that this worked very well or worked very badly. They might say
	<span class='label label-info column'>236</span>
"If we had our time over again, in the light of this experience we should do so-and-so". It could be extremely useful to the Minister, and to us, to be able to take advantage of that experience one way or the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We asked more than once—or the Minister asked me—" How do you separate out the degrees of culpability, bearing in mind that they are not related to amount?". I echo that. I said things to the like effect, but I direct his attention in that context to paragraph 52 of the Justice report, which I shall not read now but I invite the Minister's attention to it. For the benefit of the other members of the Committee, I read the first sentence:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is well known that bankrupts tend to exhibit varying degrees of culpability in relation to their affairs and that it is in practice not too difficult to separate the less serious cases from the others."</p></blockquote>
It then goes on to speak in general terms of the three categories to which I have referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that we want to cut out formalities in the case of relatively trivial bankruptcies, I quite agree. But has he considered this? His speech last Thursday amounted to this. We have cut out all the cases in which it is lilely that public examintion would be dispensed with by raising the limit to £300. There- fore, it is unlikely that there will be many applications to dispense with a public examination in the remaining cases. Is there not a close link between what we are doing in Clause 5 and what we were doing in Clause 1? Does it not follow from what the Minister says that, if one reduced the limit as we were arguing then to £200. more smaller cases would come into the machine? But they would be cut out by Clause 5, and a process that is expensive in time and money would be cut out by Clause 5 without depriving the creditors altogether of the rest of the bankruptcy procedures. If he is right in thinking that with a limit of £300 Clause 5 would have little effect, is that not a reason for reconsidering the limit we were discussing and giving to Clause 5 a little more effect in that way?—and a very useful effect it would be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke about how creditors might behave nastily. That was commenting on the New Zealand proposals. I think that some may, but I do not believe that many creditors are actuated by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>237</span>
anything more than the practical consideration of how quickest and best to get their money. I do not think that many of them want to see the limited resources going on paying counsel's fees at public examination. They would much rather that it went into their pockets, and quite right too. As a lawyer, I spend most of my time advising people not to spend their money on legal proceedings. As the Minister will know, that is the experience of all lawyers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to refer to the one remaining point of substance, because I quite appreciate that there is an argument both ways. The Minister says that the New Zealand and the Australian systems have the consequence that in neither case has the court a discretion, and he is right. The other side of that coin is that what they have ensured is precision. There is no doubt that one is in this dilemma whenever one is considering giving discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one gives a discretion, it means that cases will fall into three categories. First, there is the case in which everybody will say "We know that that falls on that side of the line, so this is a formality. We can obtain a court order. We will not resist it". Or it will fall on the other side of the line, in which case very little is spent on the proceedings, either. But there is that category in the middle on which there will be a serious argument, which takes time and expense. That is the disadvantage of it. On the other hand, the advantage of it is that it enables the court to have much more flexibility. It enables the court to decide in the individual case what is best to do. But it has to be recognised that on the other side of that argument there is the important consideration that if one takes the course adopted by New Zealand and Australia and says precisely in what circumstances there shall and shall not be a public examination, everybody knows where he is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one gets the conditions right, or nearly right, I am not sure that, on balance, one does not secure greater advantages than by leaving the discretion. I shall say no more about that because I mean what I say. I shall be very interested to know whether the Minister and his Department can get some information from New Zealand and Australia.
	<span class='label label-info column'>238</span>
and whether there have been any reports on what they did. I shall be interested to hear his further thinking on this, and we are glad to think that he will consider the arguments that have been put forward today. I give him the same assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, coming back specifically to the amendment, as we think that if there is to be a discretion there should be criteria in the Bill, we support the making of Amendment No. 44, but on the basis that is is the beginning of our consideration of the matter and this debate has been the next stage, and we shall be looking between now and Report stage for opportunities to do even better. Subject to that, we welcome the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is to erase any doubt as to whether persons other than the Official Receiver can have recourse to Section 108(1) of the 1914 Bankruptcy Act in respect of an order dispensing with a public examination. The amendment would have the effect of ensuring that the court's powers to review or rescind an order dispensing with a public examination may be exercised on the application under Section 108(1) of the debtor, a creditor

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment amends Government Amendment No. 45. It further amends the clause to make clear that an application under Section 108(1) to review or rescind an order to dispense with a public examination may be made not only by the Official Receiver, the debtor or a creditor but also by the trustee. I think that was the purpose behind Amendment (a) to Amendment No. 45, and I shall come to the new Amendment (a) in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tabled this amendment instead of merely accepting Amendment (a) to No. 45 because the term "trustee in bankruptcy" is not quite clear and it is necessary to refer simply to the term "trustee " because this is consistent with the 1914 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition—this is a point of great principle and substance—Amendment No. 63 removes the inelegance of introducing into the subsection an unnecessary " or".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have the support of the hon and learned Gentleman. Section 108(1) empowers the Bankruptcy Court to review, rescind or vary an order made by it under the bankruptcy jurisdiction, but it does not specify the category of persons who are able to apply thereunder. The amendment specifies the category of persons who are able to apply under Section 108(1) for the purpose of this clause, and they are those whom I have already indicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will be able to accept the amendment. It was the view of my officials that it was probably unnecessary, but representations have been made to us by the professional bodies, and we thought it right to clear up any possibility of dispute that might arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to Amendment No. 57. This would have the effect of empowering a trustee, as well as the Official Receiver, to apply to the court for an order to dispense with the public examination. I submit to the Committee that little practical purpose would be served if we were to agree to this amendment, for the following reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, matters connected with the public examination are normally the concern of the Official Receiver acting in that capacity. The trustee can be either the Official
	<span class='label label-info column'>240</span>
Receiver himself or, if the creditors decide otherwise, a non-official trustee—usually an accountant. Even when a non-official trustee is appointed, the Official Receiver is still responsible for the investigation of the bankrupt's affairs for the purpose of establishing the cause of failure and whether it was likely that criminality was attached to it. Such matters, of course, affect the granting of a discharge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The non-official trustee, on the other hand, is primarliy concerned with the realisation of assets and the distribution of the proceeds to the creditors. Normally, there could be only a short time span during which an application to dispense with the public examination could be made by a non-official trustee. Because he cannot take over a bankrupt's estate until after the first meeting of creditors at which the resolution for his appointment is normally passed, there will be only a short time—probably three or four weeks—between his taking office and the latest date on which an application for dispensing with the public examination could be made. I am advised that, following a normal time table, the first meeting of creditors takes place three or four weeks after the receiving order, one or two weeks later the non-official trustee takes over the estate, and then about six weeks later the public examination takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, there is usually a close liason between the Official Receiver and the trustee. The Official Receiver listens carefully to any observations that the trustee wishes to communicate to him. This must have an effect on the judgement which the Official Receiver makes in these matters. I would therefore submit that this is an unnecessary amendment, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel that it is appropriate not to pursue it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, the Minister has gone a considerable way towards meeting the various points about which we were concerned, and we are grateful to him. I am sure that the proceedings of the Committee will speed up in consequence. There are, however, one or two points which I think I should refer to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am puzzled by the length of lines on the Paper which separate one clause from another. Normally, as I understand, the line separates a clause and, in effect, indicates that there is a "Clause stand part " in between, but we have three
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1084">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>241</span>
variations today. One separates the amendment we were debating previously; another separates Amendment (a) from another amendment, which is understandable—and there is a final one after Clause 5. I am not sure what the significance of these lines is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make that extremely pedantic observation only because I am not sure that the Minister has met all the points which we had in mind. He read out his official brief at considerable speed. We take the point that in Amendment No. 63 he is extending the group of people who can apply for an order to be reviewed or rescinded. The power of the court to review or rescind may now be exercised either on the application of the Official Receiver or on the application of the debtor, a creditor or a trustee. We well understand that lie prefers the word " trustee " to " trustee in bankruptcy". I do not wish to dispute that, and I am sure his advice can be relied upon. There is, however, the question whether, as well as the Official Receiver, a trustee in bankruptcy should be entitled to apply for an order dispensing with the public examination, because the value of the assets in a bankrupt's estate might be adversely affected by that public examination, and it might be possible to demonstrate that no one would benefit from engaging in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment (a) to Amendment No. 63 is not, as I understand it, the same as Amendment No. 57. One deals with whether the trustee should be able to join with those who can apply to have an order rescinded, and the other with whether the trustee in bankruptcy or trustee, if one prefers, can actually apply for an order. I listened as hard as I could to what the Minister said, but he read out the official brief very quickly, and although I think he has met us on the point about the trustee being added to those asking to rescind or review an order, I am not sure that he commented on Amendment No. 57, which extends the powers of the trustee to apply for an order in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman now says " No," which confuses the issue even further. If he could make clear whether he is meeting us on both points or only one, we could take the matter from there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one point of substance on the question of rescinding or reviewing an order. I am not clear whether there is any time limit. Let us try to understand the possible sequence of events. To simplify it, let us say that the Official Receiver applies for an order to be made under subsection (1) that the public examination should be dispensed with. It is then possible for not only the Official Receiver but also all the other people covered by Amendment No. 63 to apply for the order to be reviewed or rescinded. Is that without time limit, or at what stage does their right to ask for the order to be reviewed expire? Does it expire within a given period? Does it expire when that stage is said—or " seems," I think is the expression—to be concluded, or is it possible for these people at any later stage to say that they have now discovered that, let us say, the debtor did not make full disclosure and therefore it had been a mistake to make the order and the whole matter should be reopened? I do not think that this is an unimportant point, and I should be grateful if the Minister could clarify it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to agree to everything that the Opposition said—only with just a wee bit. Amendment (
	<i>a</i>) to Amendment No. 63 is in fact encompassed by Amendment No. 63, so the point on that is right. I went on to talk about Amendment No. 57. I specifically dealt with that, and said that I did not think it would serve any practical purpose. Summarising the argument—the hon. Gentleman will be able to look at the 
	<i>Official Record</i> for full details—there is a very short time within which the trustee could in any event arrive at a

	<span class='label label-info column'>243</span>
determination about this matter, for the reasons that I set out in more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, the trustee and the Official Receiver in practice work very closeley together, and if the trustees felt that the bankrupt was not co-operating within the period about which we are talking, he would necessarily consult the Official Receiver, who would, in the nature of things, have regard to this in arriving at his decision. A kind of segregation of duties is fulfilled by the Official Receiver and the trustee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the practical point which the Minister is making, but I also understand that the Official Receiver will now be bound by the criteria we were discussing a few moments ago. He will be precluded from applying other criteria. The point I was making was that the trustee in bankruptcy might reasonably feel that a public examination ought to be dispensed with, because the value of the assets in the bankrupt estate might be adversely affected by that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two ways out of this dilemma. One is to give the trustee in bankruptcy the right to apply to the court, and the other is to include these criteria in those to be considered by the Official Receiver, but I should have thought that that would be a very odd thing to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even if one were to apply the thinking of the hon. Gentleman, I should have thought that the trustee would have to have regard to the criteria, too. I do not think that one can compartmentalise the argument in the way that he seeks to do. I think that on reflection he will see that that is a false argument. So far as the practice is concerned, the Official Receiver and the trustee work very closely together. The criteria to which the hon. Gentleman alluded would no doubt, subject to the other criteria which the Official Receiver must take into account, be considered by the Official Receiver.

So far as the time period is concerned, a Section 108(1) application can be made at any time prior to discharge, so there is no specific 14 or 21-day time limit. The thing is at large prior to discharge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case it would seem that the individual concerned in bankruptcy could have this prospect of a
	<span class='label label-info column'>244</span>
public examination hanging over his head for a considerable time, from when he first declared bankrupt to the end of the period when he is discharged. This seems to be a rather undesirable circumstance, if we are to widen the scope for such a dispensation in the way suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:. I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman. One must have regard to the intervening conduct of the debtor. This is the point which his argument simply does not meet and which I think it is important to preserve. It is in the interests of the creditors and of the public at large that the situation should be capable of review in the way that I have suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to consider carefully the two points which have arisen on this discussion, both the point about the original application by the trustee in bankruptcy and the second point which we have just analysed. No doubt if necessary we can return to this matter on Report. I must say that it is a pretty heavy threat to hang over the individual concerned, if it is to be exercised by the debtor, the creditor, the Official Receiver and the trustee. I should like to give further thought to that, but I do not wish to delay proceedings further at this stage. I merely wish to consider carefully what the Minister has said. I welcome the fact that he has met us on three points out of four, which is an improvement on our batting record so far, and we look forward to further concessions in a moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That Clause 5, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are several points on which we should like the Minister's views. I referred to one on Amendment No. 44, but only to say that I would return to it on "clause stand part" debate. The Minister has indicated that it is proposed to give official receivers guidance as to how they should implement Clause 5, by making changes in the rules. Can he give us a little more information on the Government's thinking? It is particularly important because at present the rule-making body is simply the Lord Chancellor with the agreement of the Secretary of Stale for Trade. Later we shall be putting proposals before the Committee
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1086">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>245</span>
for changing that and to have an insolvency rule-making committee much more akin in its composition to the other rule-making bodies in that there are representatives of the court and of the professions, practitioners and so on, upon them. It may well be that if such a proposal is acceptable to the Government, one will feel more confident about leaving to that committee the very substantial powers it has for putting a gloss on these provisions by the guidance they give on how they are to be implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even at this stage, can the Minister give us his thinking on the points raised by the working party of The Law Society and the Senate of the Bar? He will recall that in their first observations on this Bill they recommended
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the official receiver's application asking that the public examination be not held should be made in a standard form which should include a report on a number of specified matters as well as any other information which may be though material".</p></blockquote>
There is a particular point on that which may not be immediately apparent to those who do not practise in this branch of the law—it was not apparent to me until it was drawn to my attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be difficult enough implementing these provisions, but we have to bear in mind that they must all be implemented in one place or by one little band of persons. A very substantial number of these applications will be in the county courts, since, if a bankruptcy is proceeding in the county court, such an application will be in the county court. So it will be that there will be officers of the court—the county court registrars will be mostly concerned—who all at the same time will be faced with these new provisions and will have to ask themselves what they must do. It is all very well for us to talk about them; when they get the statute they have to say: "What do we do?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be of the greatest help if a standard form were produced by the rules committee which would include a report on a number of specified matters as suggested by the working party in its memorandum. It would include such matters as previous bankruptcies or the winding up of companies of which the bankrupt has been a director, which must be a relevant consideration, although it is not referred to in the criteria. One would think, taking the sense of the Bill as a
	<span class='label label-info column'>246</span>
whole, that that would be a relevant consideration. It would include information about any certificate of misfortune given in connection with another bankruptcy. On the whole, I think I agree with what the Minister said earlier in our debates on this. To say that one cannot exclude a public examination because a person has been bankrupt before and leave it at that without any qualification would probably not be sufficiently flexible. If the first bankruptcy was due to misfortune and a certificate to that effect was available, that should have considerable bearing on the question of whether a public examination was in order in the bankruptcy then under consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should include evidence of misfortune leading to the present bankruptcy, which is specially directed to what the Minister has referred to more than once this morning—the degree of culpability, which is the kernel of the matter. It is important all through the bankruptcy, but most especially in connection with the question of whether there should be a public examination. Evidence or suspicion of fraud and evidence of improvidence should also be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may have other views about what the guidance is to be. He referred in the Second Reading Committee to the proposal that it had been intended to give the guidance, which is now given by the criterion which has been added to the Bill by way of alterations in the rules. I hope he will not feel that, now that the criteria have been included in the Bill itself, there will no longer be any need to give any guidance through the rules. I draw attention to that suggestion, and I wonder whether the Minister would now comment on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next point on which we should like the hon. Gentleman's view is how he sees what we are doing in Clause 5 affecting Section 73 of the Act of 1914, which is the Act which sets out the duties of the official receiver as regards the debtor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"As regards the debtor, it shall be the duty of official receiver …".</p></blockquote>
There is a number of subparagraphs which set out his duty in regard to the debtor. Now we are introducing something that may be very helpful to the debtor. We are introducing the possibility that he may not have to go through a public examination. What is the Official Receiver's duty
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1087">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>247</span>
to be in relation to that aspect of the matter? What is his duty to the debtor to be in that connection? It would seem that some amplification of Section 73 will be necessary. There is none in the Bill at the moment. I invite the Minister's views now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think also that Rule 321 of the Bankruptcy Rules, which permits the Official Receiver to give evidence by way of a report to the court instead of an affidavit, may need consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another aspect. Presumably, when the Official Receiver is to be or may be involved in another proceeding—an application to dispense with public examination, in connection with which he may have to make a report or reports, are we quite sure that in doing what he has to do in consequence of Clause 5, he will enjoy absolute privilege? It starts with the proposition that when a duty is put on someone to do something that may entail his saying something nasty about someone else, he may then be open to action for having said it. It is only desirable that at the same time as we put that duty upon him, we should make quite certain that he enjoys absolute privilege.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are some of the background questions that arise in connection with the practical implementation of what we have been talking about this morning. Before we pass from the clause, I hope that the Minister will be able to say a little about those matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only point on which we seek further clarification from the Minister—and it has been mentioned by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Southport (Mr. Percival)—is his view on the procedure for making an application. Clearly, there may be some danger that, having decided in some cases to dispense with a public examination, the actual application for the dispensation itself assumes the nature of a public hearing. He would agree that it probably would be an undesirable development, but perhaps he will be kind enough to give us his views on that aspect of the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the points made by the hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) in regard to giving the Official Receiver guidance on making changes in the rules, of course we
	<span class='label label-info column'>248</span>
shall take into account very strongly the representations that were made by the working party in the formulation of the rules. It is commonsence that we should do so, and that shall be applied. I shall not go into any more detail because I have given that assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as Section 73 is concerned, I am not sure that I understand the hon. and learned Gentleman. The duties of the Official Receiver concerning the debtor's conduct as set out in Section 73 will remain. I shall look carefully at what he said, but I do not see what purpose …</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the Minister for the assurances already given. I am satisfied if his attitude to my comments is that he will ensure that the views of the working party and Justice on these matters are fully canvassed and taken into account before any steps are taken. It is much better for them to develop the question of Section 73 with the officials in the Department, and I am perfectly happy if the Minister says that they will be pursued in that way. I am happy to leave it there and get on with Clause 6.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the hon. and learned Member for allowing me to leave that point and also the point with regard to Rule 321 of the Bankruptcy Rules. On the question of absolute privilege, there is no reason for there being any requirement to change the provision, but I shall look into the matter to make sure that I am right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as the point of the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) is concerned, the application is to be made 
	<i>ex parte,</i> as it is at the present time. When a debtor is unfit to attend the public examination it is made 
	<i>ex parte</i> by the Official Receiver. That was the point that he was seeking to make. The actual procedure is a matter which we shall, as I have indicated already to his hon. and learned Friend, be considering very carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful if I were to set out the Government's thinking about new Clause 4, which goes to the heart of this group of amendments. It may be helpful if I try to get through it before One o'clock because the Committee may feel that it is desirable if I could place my remarks on the record, so that they could be considered before next Thursday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose and effect of the new clause is, first, to empower the court to make an order, at the time an order is made, including public examination or dispensing with public examination, directing that the bankrupt shall have an absolute order of discharge on the fifth anniversary of the date of the adjudication. Secondly, it would enable the Official Receiver or the trustee, where such an order has been made, to apply to the court to rescind the order at any time before the discharge becomes effective; that is to say, before the fifth anniversary of the date of the adjudication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third purpose is to grant an absolute discharge on the carrying forth of this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1090">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>253</span>
clause or on the tenth anniversary of the date of adjudication, whichever is the later, to all bankrupts who were adjudged bankrupt more than five years before the coming into force of this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) gives power to the court a the time that it makes an order including the public examination, or when it makes an order dispensing with a public examination, to make an order that unless the bankrupt has already been absolutely discharged, or the adjudication has been allowed—that is provided for in subsection (2)—the bankrupt, if he is subsequently adjudged bankrupt, or if he has already been adjudged bankrupt, will be absolutely discharged on the fifth anniversary of the date of adjudication. The subsection also sets out the criteria to which the court shall have regard in determining whether to make such an order, namely all the circumstances of the case, including, in particular, the facts which are set out in Section 26 (3) of the Bankruptcy Act 1914. I do not think that is necessary for me to recount those facts, because they appear from the Act itself, and I think I can leave it at that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The additional criteria to which the court shall have regard are whether the debtor has committed any offence under the Bankruptcy Acts or any other offence connected with his bankruptcy. If the court at the particular time stated in the subsection—that is to say, when ordering the public examination to be concluded or dispensed with—does not make an order directing the grant of an absolute discharge on the fifth anniversary of the date of the adjudication, the bankruptcy will be reviewed for discharge purposes under the provisions of Clause 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to subsection (2). In that connection I point out that subsection (1) has the effect of enabling the court to make an order before the debtor has been adjudicated bankrupt. Subsection (2) provides in consequence that an order made by the court under subsection (1) granting an absolute discharge to a bankrupt on the fifth anniversary of the date of the adjudication will be effective only if, in fact, he was adjudicated bankrupt, and his discharge has not already become absolute before the fifth anniversary of the date of the adjudication or the adjudication has not already been annulled before that anniversary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>254</span>
Subsection (3) provides that the power of the bankruptcy court under Section 108 (1) of the Bankruptcy Act 1914 to review, rescind or vary any order made by it under its bankruptcy jurisdiction shall not apply to an order under subsection (1) granting automatic discharge. This provides instead for power to be given to the court to rescind the order at any time before the discharge becomes effective—the fifth anniversary of the date of the adjudication—on the application of either the Official Receiver or the trustee. It is intended to seek amendment of the Bankruptcy Rules to include criteria to guide the Official Receiver and the trustee in determining whether to make such an application. These criteria will include: (a) if the bankrupt has failed to co-operate with the Official Receiver or trustee; (b) if the bankrupt, subsequent to the order, has been adjudicated bankrupt again, and (c) if the bankrupt, subsequent to the order, has committed any offence under the 1914 Act or any offence connected with his bankruptcy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the very normal part of the provisions of this new clause and I will also try to deal with some of the basic thinking which has caused us to come to the conclusion that this is a desirable course to adopt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4) provides for all bankrupts who have been adjudicated bankrupt more than five years before the coming into force of this clause to be absolutely discharged on the coming into force of this clause, or on the 10th anniversary of the date of the adjudication, whichever is the later, provided that they have not, by that relevant date, already been absolutely discharged or had the adjudication annulled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that there are something like 100,000 undischarged bankrupts at the present time, or at least that will be the figure when the Bill comes into force. Those whose bankruptcies are less than five years old when Clause 6 comes into force will be dealt with by review under that clause. Their bankruptcies will be looked at for the purpose of discharge during the sixth year following the date of the order of adjudication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is the others which present the real problem—that is to say, those over five years old. They are too many for review to be a realistic proposition. The only way in which it could be done
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1091">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>255</span>
would be over a very long period of time and that in itself is unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the choice that lay before me in this respect was either that they could be left to apply for discharge under Section 26 of the Bankruptcy Act 1914—and there is an argument for that because, after all, they went bankrupt under the old law and maybe they should seek discharge under the provisions of the old law as well. Alternatively, they could be granted an automatic discharge after a fixed period. We have to face it that there will be some rogues caught up in that, but I think one should have regard primarily to the vast majority of these people who are left under very serious and at the moment perpetual civil disabilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do we have data on how many of that group are bankrupt above a certain amount? n other words, do we know the amount by which they went bankrupt? Could one say that it should be automatic for less than £10,000 or something of that sort? Do we have the information on which to make such a division?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think the information is readily available, but I will look at the point between now and next Thursday. On balance, the view that I took here was that the most equitable solution was that the old cases should benefit from automatic discharge after 10 years, so that those whose adjudication is already 10 years old when the clauses come into force will be discharged absolutely, and those which are then more than five years but less than 10 years old will receive an automatic discharge on the 10th anniversary of the order of adjudication. These automatic discharges will have the same effect as other discharges and, like them, will be without prejudice to the provisions of Sections 26(9) and 28 of the Bankruptcy Act 1914 whereby the discharged bankrupt is still under an obligation to assist his trustee and is still liable for those debts from which discharge does not release him.

I think that this matter merits most careful consideration by the Committee, and I am sure that hon. Members will provide that consideration. I will also at the next sitting advert to new Clause 3 but I do not think that I can do justice to it in three minutes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks whether I am in favour of it. I think he will find out at the next sitting but, if it will cause him sleepless nights, perhaps I ought to say at this moment that I am not. I think that the purposes of the new clause to which I have spoken and the new clause to which hon. Gentlemen will he able to develop their arguments next time are not far apart. The objectives are very similar. It is a question of arriving at the right balance of judgment, of seeing how we can arrive at the best solution in the Bill.

I think that there are serious difficulties about simply applying Blagden. I would put the hon. Gentlemen on notice now because perhaps they can put it right later on, but I think they have become confused in the drafting of the amendments. I may be wrong—if so, I stand to be corrected—but in some places I think that they have referred to the two-year suggestion which was the Blagden one, and in other to five years, and some confusion has resulted. It may be as well if that could be remedied before next Thursday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are perfectly understandable reasons for arriving at that situation in a complex matter of this kind because one is adverting to one suggestion at one time and then one must have regard to what appears in the Bill and sometimes the two things are difficult to relate.

I think that unquestionably the most important issue for the Committee is how to deal with these very old undischarged bankrupts. There is a very real social problem here. A large number of them are deterred for one reason or another from applying for their discharge. Maybe there is a good deal of stigma attached to it and they are ashamed. They move to another area away from that where they carried on their business previously, and they are ashamed to impart any information to anybody about the fact that they have been bankrupt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A lot of people in this category are not wholly blameworthy. They fall into the two categories to which the hon. and learned Gentleman referred to in a previous debate. How to deal with them is very important to them and to the community as a whole. My view is that

we ought to take a liberal attitude about this problem, and I hope that I shall be able to carry the Committee with me as far as that basic principle is concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
