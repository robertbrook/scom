	<div class='title'>—(ESTABLISHMENT AND PRINCIPAL FUNCTIONS OF SUGAR BOARD.)</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Frederick Willey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 7, to leave out "appointed day" and to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"first day of January, nineteen hundred and sixty."</p></blockquote>
Let me be frank. This is what is generally known as a wrecking Amendment. It will probably meet the convenience of the Committee if I explain briefly the Opposition's attitude towards the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I might be allowed to stray near the bounds of order by congratulating the Minister on a speech which I heard him make yesterday. We all enjoyed it, and it impressed us very much. For reasons which the right hon. Gentleman will understand, I cannot say more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we explained on Second Reading, we oppose the Bill on three fundamental grounds. We think the opportunity ought to have been taken to remove the element of private capital from the British Sugar Corporation. Our attitude is that, if this is not done, we should prefer the
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
present arrangements to continue until my hon. Friends and I have an opportunity to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also critical of the Bill because we believe—I know this is a matter which disturbs the Minister—that it disturbs Commonwealth relations. There is not such a confident feeling about the continuance of the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement as there was before the introduction of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for that reason that we move our Amendment. By 1st January, 1960, the position would be quite clear. We should know then whether the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement was being continued, and, equally important, we should know the terms on which it was being continued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our third objection to the Bill is that we strongly object to the fiscal policy behind it, which has been pursued in other directions by the Government, of placing the burden of the aid to British agriculture directly upon the consumer. This is novel in so far as it is now affecting the 1947 price guarantees. This, again, is very disturbing to the British farmer. After all, the right hon. Gentleman is aware by now that there is great disturbance in the farming industry. In spite of the machinery of the guarantees, the farmers are losing confidence in the Government's intention to stand behind the guarantees. That is another contribution to the feeling of disturbance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we find price support for maintaining British sugar production in this country—after all, in this case it is given largely on strategic defence grounds—placed not upon the Exchequer but upon the housewife when she goes shopping.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to correct an impression which might be gained by the casual reader of the OFFICIAL REPORT. The under-Secre-tary of State for Commonwealth Relations was reported as indicating dissent when I put forward the same argument about support for Commonwealth development and welfare. I gather that the Under-Secretary was merely nodding his head. No doubt he was carried away by the eloquence of my peroration; but he was not indicating dissent. It is accepted that there is a contribution which can be made in the way of Commonwealth development and welfare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0458">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
We think it wrong that there should be support by means of a tax upon the housewife when she buys sugar across the grocer's counter. Aid of the character required should be placed squarely on the Exchequer. That is the fundamental political difference between the two sides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We move the Amendment because we are confident that by 1st January, 1960, the Labour Party will be in a position of authority and responsibility in which it can ensure that this fiscal burden shall not be a permanent part of our legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move the Amendment with a slight degree of reluctance. I know that there are many hon. Gentlemen opposite who would like to get rid of the Bill. They do not want their own Government to put on the Statute Book a Measure which is largely Socialistic. They are very embarrassed in view of what they said during the General Election about physical controls, price controls, import licensing and the rest. Yet the Government are here seeking to impose conditions of that nature. This places me in some difficulty, because I do not particularly want to welcome support on that ground, although I should like the Government to accept the Amendment if they feel that the weight of opinion on the Government side of the Committee is sufficiently strong to justify their postponing the matter altogether until 1960.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from our fundamental objections, we support the Bill for the reasons which cause hon. Gentlemen opposite to oppose it. If we have, as I believe we must, to support bulk purchase through the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement, then we have to reinforce that by a system of physical control. Again, if we accept an industry which is largely a monopoly—it is a very closely defined monopoly—we think it right and proper that the Minister should reserve to himself powers of price control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have taken this opportunity to inform the Committee that we shall not oppose many of the Bill's provisions in detail. Our objections to the Measure are on broad grounds, and broad political grounds, and it is for this reason that I move the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Heathcoat Amory)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might make a very brief intervention now. First, I should like to thank
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
the hon. Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. F. Willey) very much for his friendly remarks about a speech that I made yesterday. I have always found that my speeches go better when most of the audience cannot hear exactly what I say, and I do not think that anybody further than a yard from me could conceivably have heard anything that I said yesterday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have given very careful thought to the Amendments which have been tabled by the Opposition. As a result of our cogitations, we came to the conclusion, as the hon. Gentleman has announced, that the Amendments might be identified as of the wrecking variety. Also it is a well know tactical device, which was exploited during the war, to go straight in with an all-out attack shortly after dawn in the hope that the enemy will not have dug themselves in. I am sure, however, that right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite will not for a moment think that we could accept the Amendment now under discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that one of the reasons for postponing the appointed day until 1960 was so that it would by then be known whether or not the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement was to continue. The original Agreement, made by the present Government shortly after they took office and for which, as I have said, the ground was prepared and the negotiations entered into by the Labour Government, was due to end in 1959. It has, however, been continued year by year and, therefore, at present it stands to be terminated in 1962. The annual discussions, which are going on at the present time, are being conducted in a friendly way, and I hope that they may come to a conclusion within the next few days, in which case we shall be able to say what the future of the Agreement will be in that connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that the Amendment was based on the hypothesis that something might happen between now and 1960 which would radically alter the situation and place the control of events in others hands. That seems to me to be such a remote contingency that I cannot for a moment think it could seriously be put forward as the basis for postponing the Measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also said that the Bill seemed to be such a Socialistic Measure that it might not appeal to my
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0459">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
hon. Friends. The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. Were it such a Socialistic Measure, I should have thought that he and his right hon. and hon. Friends would have welcomed it with open arms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not detain the Committee further now except to say that we feel that if proximity is the first requirement for mutual agreement and understanding—we have never felt closer to the Opposition than we are required to be by the seating provisions in this Committee—the Bill ought to be received in a spirit of the greatest harmony.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a little more than a purely formal wrecking intention in the Amendment. We feel that if we are faced with the alternative of proceeding as laid down in the Bill, it would be better to continue as we are doing now. Incidentally, it is not such an extraordinary idea that we should wait until a General Election so that the people can express their views one way or the other on a great and important issue like this which has many Commonwealth implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are probably all agreed that the time has come to get rid of State trading in the precise form in which it has been going on and is going on in this respect at the moment. That does not mean that we are agreed about what should be substituted for the present system. I think that what the Government are proposing to put in its place is a great deal worse than the present system. There are much better ways of getting rid of State trading now, without all the consequences, both internally and in the Commonwealth, which will flow from what is proposed in the Bill. We could have a Sugar Board with real powers for purchasing sugar at large, and able, perhaps with the Corporation, to run the refineries and so on, and we should then avoid all the extreme complexities which arise in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trouble with the Bill is that the Government, for doctrinal reasons, are determined to restore a phoney appearance of private enterprise. The appearance will be accurate only in so far as private enterprise will make the profit, and not in that it will have to be enterprising. All the risks of private enterprise will be taken by the Board and the Cor-
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
poration, particularly with regard to imported sugar, but the profits will be made by private enterprise. There is also in the Bill a very large concealed subsidy element which will go to private enterprise. That is not the sort of picture of private enterprise that my hon. Friends and I have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not altogether in agreement with my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. F. Willey) when he says that the Bill has Socialistic elements in it. It seems to me that all it has is some unnecessary physical controls. No Socialist wants unnecessary physical controls. We certainly say that physical controls must be enacted and enforced where necessary in the public interest, but the physical controls in the Bill result from the extraordinary doctrinal attempt to restore a non-existent, fictional free market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we had a Board with proper powers, we should not need to give the Minister the fantastic physical controls which I can quite understand worry hon. Gentlemen opposite very much. The controls are most extraordinary and most disturbing. All sorts of new things are made offences which are not offences today, and all sorts of new penalties appear. The whole thing could be done very much more simply. If it were done in a proper Socialist way we should not have all these physical controls, because the Board would be given general powers to carry on as other boards do and the Minister would not have the awful responsibility of deciding when, where and to what extent to enforce the provisions about new offences and penalties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also think that the present arrangements should continue because I do not think that the Bill is in the interests of the Commonwealth. We must remember that the general context is that the Government have torn up every other long-term bulk purchase Commonwealth agreement except this one. The Government, therefore, cannot make a great parade of the fact that they are helping the Commonwealth. The present arrangement for the purchase of sugar is the last little bit of long-term bulk purchase which the Government have not been able to get rid of, because they are committed to the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement. They have got rid of all the others with the greatest
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0460">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
alacrity. They cannot claim to be a Government who are encouraging Commonwealth production by giving Commonwealth countries long-term guaranteed markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Beyond the fact that this case is the only one that is left, there is also the fact that the Government make such a fuss about it. We think of this enormous Bill, the enormous number of physical controls and the fantastic difficulty of fitting these arrangements into the Government's conception of what a market should be. In view of that, there is doubt in the Commonwealth whether even this little example of long-term bulk purchases will survive if the Government can find any way of getting rid of it. This must make producers in the rest of the Commonwealth feel that the Government will not be able to have any other bulk purchase or long-term agreements, because the Government will not again go into these fantastic lengths to fit in others when even this simple example involves a Bill of the immense complexity and difficulty of the one which we are now considering. For these reasons, the Amendment is valuable and must appeal to the hearts of many hon. Members opposite. I certainly hope that we can carry the Amendment. If we do, it will save us a great deal of time and trouble.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. F. Willey) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Smethwick (Mr. Gordon Walker) have dealt with high politics, but I should like to raise a question of perhaps a more immediate and practical importance. The Amendment suggests a specific date, in January, 1960, but the words proposed to be left out are "appointed day." As far as I can remember, the Minister gave no indication on Second Reading of the date of the appointed day. It seems clear that when the Bill was drafted, negotiations with interested parties had not been completed and, consequently, the Government are proposing Amendments in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We on this side of the Committee do not yet know whether the negotiations are now completed and when the Minister intends to select an appointed day. The country is entitled to know what progress the Government have made and when the new arrangements will begin to operate. Will the new Board be set up only after
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
another great block of buildings has been erected in London in which it can be suitably housed? Or is it assumed that the new Board is to be set up in 1956 or 1957? We should be given some idea of what progress has been made in this matter and of the date on which we can expect the Bill, after enactment, to come into operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Harmar Nicholls)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The appointed day is not fixed as an actual date on the calendar, but it is expected that three months will have to elapse after the Royal Assent. We want that date to be as early as possible. Within those limits the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Dye) can work out the appointed day from his judgment of how long the Committee will take to complete its work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Smethwick (Mr. Gordon Walker) worked very hard to put some semblance of authenticity into the Amendment. His words would have sounded very much better if we had not had an admission from the hon. Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. F. Willey) that the Amendment was all make-believe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Smethwick said that the Bill was a limitation of present arrangements. He would prefer to let matters remain as they were because, according to him, nobody knew quite what to put in their place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was not quite with the right hon. Member when he spoke of a concealed subsidy. I have tried hard to get inside the meaning of the Bill and I have not discovered the concealed subsidy at which the right hon. Member hinted. Nor can

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
I agree that an extra profit margin would be allowed to sugar refiners. There is nothing in the Bill to justify that contention. As to the reference to the weakening of Commonwealth arrangements, similar words were used on Second Reading. It is sad that they were used, because that is not true and I think that deep in their hearts hon. and right hon. Members opposite do not believe it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The evidence points to the contrary. The Commonwealth Sugar Agreement has been extended each year and there could be no clearer evidence than that of the Government's intention to continue to support the Commonwealth understanding which is the basis of that Agreement. We should not give any thought in Committee to the idea that the Government are likely to weaken that position. I hope that I have satisfied hon. Members on both sides that the Amendment is one which we should not wish to see succeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. A. G. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not a wrecking Amendment in the sense that we want to be mischievous. It is necessary to move the Amendment in this way so that we can express our sincere belief that the Bill should be delayed and that the appointed day should be 1st January, 1960. This is all a matter of timing. The Joint Parliamentary Secretary has spoken about a knockout. We are not attempting a knockout. We are asking the Government to be reasonable, and we are as conciliatory as we can be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier we threw some doubt on the wisdom of ending the present arrangements. We certainly want the arrangements to continue and we are pressing for that now. The Minister said that the Amendment was a tactical attack. I do not know what the right hon. Gentleman meant by his reference to an attack soon after dawn. I put a different interpretation on the matter at this hour of the morning. I am reminded of the farmer who complained about daylight saving on the ground that if the clock had not been altered he would have been older and much nearer to receiving his pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned about the Commonwealth and the Colonies as a whole and about their development and welfare. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Bill also concerns millions of domestic consumers in this country. Most of the sugar is consumed domestically and we are concerned that the Bill will mean an inflationary tendency, because costs will rise in the case of sugar as they have done in the case of all the basic foods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the Government originally had any intention of carrying out the Commonwealth Agreement. They are opposed to bulk buying and they would destroy the Agreement if they could, but they have to meet their obligations. The Bill is introduced to provide a halfway house on the way towards private enterprise. The Minister is on a slippery slope. Ultimately there will be pressure on him to hand over the whole of the buying and trading to private enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has commitments to the Commonwealth under the Agreement, and obligations under the Agriculture Act, 1947, but we may find that, as a result of subsidy considerations next year, these arrangements will be placed in jeopardy. That would be another step in helping the Minister to meet the wishes of those who have put pressure on the Government to bring to an end the present arrangements for buying sugar. We believe that bulk purchase, long-term agreements and State trading in present circumstances are infinitely superior to handing over to private enterprise a course which has landed us in our present economic morass.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Jeger</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I noticed that the Secretary of State for the Colonies hurriedly left the Committee when my right hon. Friend the Member for Smethwick (Mr. Gordon Walker) spoke. I am sorry about that. While it may have shown an attack of conscience on the part of the Colonial Secretary, I believe that it also showed that in the provisions of the Clause relating to the establishment of the appointed day there is no consideration whatsoever for the Colonies. I am sure that that will be noticed in the Colonies and the Commonwealth with great regret. We have obligations towards them and they feel a certain amount of uncertainty about how far those obligations will be fulfilled. We on this side of the Committee feel that they should be fulfilled to the letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Postponement of the operation of the Bill until 1960 would take those obligations into account. If the Clause stands,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0462">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
with an appointed day which we have been threatened may be three months hence, it will have a bad effect on sugar producers and people in the Colonies generally. The atmosphere in our Colonies today, unfortunately, is not as happy as it should be. We should not do anything to aggravate the situation or to create in the minds of people the feeling that they are being neglected, abandoned, or thrown on one side. I appeal to the Committee to accept the Amendment because it will lead to better understanding and better feeling on the part of our people in the Commonwealth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are sorry that the Minister is not being more realistic about this matter. The Joint Parliamentary Secretary has introduced a new element. It is now clear that the Government are going to rush the Bill through. They must have in mind who is to be chairman of the Board. What has convinced the Government that they must go ahead at this speed? Why are they so anxious to get the Bill on the Statute Book and implement it at once? My right hon. Friends and I have raised some points of substance. Whether the Minister concedes it or not, the introduction of the Bill has caused a great deal of disturbance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that in the light of that the Government would not have been so anxious to proceed at such speed. This is new information before the Committee. Until the Parliamentary Secretary spoke we did not know that not only were the Government determined to go ahead with the Measure, regardless of criticisms which may be made against it and arguments for postponing it, but that they were determined to get it on the Statute Book as soon as possible and to bring the Board into existence as soon as possible. This is a matter which vitally affects Commonwealth relations, particularly in one very susceptible part of the Commonwealth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think my right hon. Friend the Member for Smethwick (Mr. Gordon Walker) and I are at variance. He regards the Bill as phoney and thinks I am perhaps a little altruistic in describing some of the mechanisms of the Bill as Socialistic. I understood my right hon. Friend to say that the Bill is phoney because we know quite well what pressure will come from the back benches opposite and we
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
know that the provisions of the Bill which I have described as Socialistic—the control of profit margins, physical control and price control—will be inoperative. They are put in to make it appear as though we shall have orderly marketing, but in fact the Bill will be rushed through and in a moment we shall hear that the Minister is already making concessions to the trade. In fact, the Bill will be a dead letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This, again, is a disturbing element: it seems that we have a conspiracy of silence on the Conservative back benches. We had a similar attitude on Second Reading. We feel that it is because they are saying, "We know this is camouflage; you can rush this through and the trade will have its own way."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I proceed I should therefore like an assurance from the Government that they mean business on the Bill, that they are not taking these powers merely for the sake of taking them but that they intend to use them. We want an assurance—and this is vitally important—that they recognise that in the sugar trade as it is in the world today it is dangerous to talk about free enterprise. We cannot have business men combing the world for sugar. It must be an orderly market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had a lot of difficulty in sugar marketing before the war. At any rate we have a more stable market now, but it is a difficult commodity to handle and I hope the right hon. Gentleman will take this opportunity of making it quite clear to everybody that he is not only taking these powers in the Bill but that, although he is not following a course which we think is the right course, he intends rigorously to apply those powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I described this as a wrecking Amendment, it was not a reflection on the Amendment but an indication of its importance. That is why I was frank about the matter. We do not want the Committee to vote in any dubiety. I said I was anxious that my frankness should not attract support for the wrong reasons. I did not want hon. Members opposite to support me because they thought these measures were not in the spirit of free enterprise. Incidentally, I should like someone to have the honesty to stand up and say whether he believes that if the powers are put on the Statute Book they will be enforced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0463">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
From the conspiracy of silence among hon. Members opposite I have a suspicion that they are not very worried about the Bill. It ought to worry them, for they have argued against price control, control of profit margins and physical control. They are saying nothing now, and I can only suspect that they know quite well, or have reason to believe—to use a more appropriate phrase—that the Bill is phoney. For those reasons, we must ask the Committee to divide against the Government on this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. James Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the absence of any competition from the benches opposite, may I rise to put a question to the Minister? He made a typically whimsical speech. We all like the Minister, who has endeared himself to us, but it is a pity that the Secretary of State for the Colonies has left us, because he is in much closer touch with such territories as Mauritius, Barbados and other places. The people in such territories fear the party opposite. It is no good hon. Members opposite saying one thing and doing another; these bulk purchase agreements are all disappearing. This small baby, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Smethwick (Mr. Gordon Walker) described it, is the only one left.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Producers in the Commonwealth fear the return of the bad old days of the 1930s. They fear that this is the beginning of an era in which we shall be buying cheap Cuban dumped sugar. There has already been some experience with barley, wheat and other cereals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to tell us how much of this old fear is left in the minds of the producers in the Colonies. They are hag-ridden with the recollections of the old days. I have talked to some of them and I know exactly how they feel. I should like the Minister therefore to be as forthcoming as he can and to tell us that he means what he says when he gives an assurance that we shall buy sugar under these conditions in the 1960s and onwards. There is a fear among the producers that they are on the slippery slope, that they will soon be deprived of even this half a loaf and that the producers overseas will not get even a slice in the 1960s.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. R. Moss</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to draw the Committee's attention to the three
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
constants and the three variables involved in the Bill and I should like to ask the Minister some questions about the purpose of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first constant is the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement which has been negotiated under present arrangements and has removed many bitter memories of the past. Commonwealth countries, and especially Commonwealth sugar producers, are delighted to have some degree of stability. In what way does the Bill strengthen the stability which has been arranged for Commonwealth producers already? Why is it necessary to make a change?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second constant is the beet sugar industry in this country, for which, the Minister said, Governments of all political complexions have been responsible in the past. On Second Reading he seemed to think that both the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement and the arrangements with the beet sugar industry at home were admirable. In what way does the Bill advantage the arrangements which exist for home beet sugar production?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third constant is rather different—the balance of payments. It was said in the White Paper that this was one of the factors which the Bill affected. Do present arrangements make it difficult to have regard to the balance of payments? Does the Bill make it easier to have regard to the balance of payments? I agree that the balance of payments is a most important question for this country and that when we take any action we should have constant regard for the balance of payments. In what way does the Bill improve the present arrangements for the balance of payments?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may draw the right hon. Gentleman's attention to the three variables in one. He intends to put an end to State trading in sugar. Why? In what way does the Bill affect the three constants which I have mentioned? Why put an end to State trading in sugar? Has it had some deleterious effects upon the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement, upon the home beet industry or upon the balance of payments?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second variable is that the right hon. Gentleman wants to restore freedom to the London Terminal Sugar Market. The difficulty about doing that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0464">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
is to do it at the same time as he maintains stability in the three matters which I have mentioned. To use the words of the White Paper, he wants to restore some degree of freedom to "the sugar and sugar using trades." Of course, the degree of freedom which can be restored to the sugar and sugar using trades is strictly limited by the arrangements in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These seem to me to be very important questions which the right hon. Gentleman ought to explain before we go further with the Bill, and I hope he will do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Colonies has asked me to apologise to the Committee for his withdrawal. He had unfortunately to go to another very important engagement, where, for many reasons, I ought to have joined him, but I feel that I cannot tear myself away from the Committee this morning. Unfortunately, his Minister of State is abroad. My right hon. Friend would have liked to have been here, particularly during this discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Dye) raised the question of the appointed day. I well remember that when I was on Committees, in the Opposition, I always tried to raise the question of the appointed day as quickly as I could, because if the Government said they were fixing the appointed day very late one could accuse them of being half-hearted and not believing in the Bill, whereas if they said they would fix it as soon as possible one could say they were rushing the Bill through. The answer I would give to the hon. Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. F. Willey) is this. He asked whether we mean business on the Bill. We most certainly do; and it is because we mean business that we propose to fix the appointed day as soon as practicable after the Bill has received the Royal Assent. I think that is the sensible and right thing to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Moss) asked about the objects of the Bill. I indicated them as clearly as I could on Second Reading and I do not think I will repeat them now. He himself repeated our two main objects—to get out of Government trading and to enable the London Terminal Sugar Market to re-open. He asked why we should have no State trading, and the
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
answer is: because we do not believe that a Government should enter directly into trading. That is one of our firm principles and we have never found an instance in which we have regretted holding that view. It is our general policy; we do not believe that the Government should themselves participate in trading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that there are three main points to consider—the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement, the agreement with the producers in the home beet sugar industry and the balance of payments. I asked the right hon. Gentleman in what way State trading has affected those three important points. I appreciate that the right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite have a theoretical objection to the intervention of the Government in economic affairs, but I am asking the Minister to show why State trading should be abolished and to show that it has badly affected these three important constants which we had in the White Paper, in the Bill and in the Minister's speech on Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our objection is not only theoretical but practical. We have the strongest practical objection to the Government participating in trading if some alternative is available, as nearly always is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing in the Bill in any way affects the working of the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement or the arrangements with the producer in the home beet sugar industry. Nor can I see that it will have any effect on the balance of payments, except possibly in so far as the London Terminal Sugar Market will be able as a result of its operations to earn foreign currency as it did before the war. To that extent it should improve the balance of payments position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I found part of the Minister's reply rather disquieting, because the only reason he gave for the rejection of the Amendment was that he and his hon. and right hon. Friends did not approve of State trading. When he was asked why, he repeated that they did not believe in it; that it was a matter of principle; a matter of faith. If I may judge from the silence on the other side of the Committee, that faith does not burn very strongly in the breast of any hon. Member except that of the right hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0465">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
Gentleman and of his Joint Parliamentary Secretary. When he was further pressed—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dudley Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our silence is a token of our boredom with the hon. Gentleman's views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Tiley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it necessary to be permanently stating the obvious, and taking up the time of the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would say to hon. Members opposite that when one is bored by the speeches of other hon. Members, it is curious to adopt the remedy of not making a speech oneself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was suggested by one hon. Member opposite that there was no need to continue stating the obvious. Unfortunately, when my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mr. Moss), in a very able speech, pressed the right hon. Gentleman to express his views further, it did not appear that the Minister's case was at all obvious. When he endeavoured to reply to my hon. Friend, the Minister merely described his objections to the Amendment as not only theoretical but practical. It was merely a statement—"This is what we believe, and we shall go on stating that we believe it, and not be any more elaborate than that."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me is this. If the Minister had been able to show that in this instance there were solid objections to State trading, one might have accepted the proposition that the appointed day should be at the early date which the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary have stated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the position? Under the Sugar Agreement, the people of this country give help to the people of the West Indian Colonies. I do not think that it will be disputed that that is the main effect of the Agreement. Granted that fact, one of the most convenient ways to give that help is in the way in which it has been given up to now. The curious thing about the Bill is that the Government, having accepted the Sugar Agreement, can pursue its doctrinaire dislike of State trading only by making an arrangement for the trading in sugar to be extremely complicated and tortuous. We think that State trading and not a Sugar Agreement is the best way in which to help the people of the West Indies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
When we give help to the Colonies there comes the question of the way in which that help is to be collected up from the people of this country. The effect of the Bill as it seems to me—and this is a matter which we can only discuss in detail later on—is to make the way in which that help is collected from the people in this country less satisfactory and less equitable than it is at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot feel that any ground has been advanced for bringing about that undesirable result as soon as possible, rather than waiting until the year 1960. It was suggested that the proposition of my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. F. Willey), in his opening speech, that by 1960 there might have been a change in the control of affairs, was an unlikely suggestion. It is a pity that this Committee, unlike another Committee on which I was serving recently, lacks the services of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Putney (Sir H. Linstead) who, with an eye on the recent municipal election in his constituency, might have taken a different view on this question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had only a doctrinaire answer. Apart from a few startled ejaculations from the back benches, we have had only Ministerial pronouncements as to why the Amendment should be rejected. I trust that my hon. Friends will press the case for the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his confession about what he did about Amendments concerning an appointed day when he was in Opposition, and I deduce from that that when he is in Opposition again he will not use that device against us, because he has been rather too frank about it now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amory</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would suggest to the right hon. Gentleman that when making speeches it is always a wise thing for a politician to look forward to a possible change in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main purpose is to comment on the misplaced complacency of the Joint Parliamentary Secretary in regard to the Government's record on Commonwealth trading and the encouragement of Commonwealth production. The Government have a very bad record in this respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0466">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
They have torn up masses of long-term bulk purchase agreements which were helping Commonwealth production, and they have deprived themselves of any means of helping Commonwealth production, except in this one case. The Government can make beautiful speeches but they cannot do anything but that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has told us that for doctrinaire reasons he is against State trading. He has advanced no practical reasons. He merely says, as a matter of faith, that it is a bad thing and that to get rid of it is a good thing. But what are the consequences of getting rid of State trading? The agreements with the Commonwealth on meat, wheat, dairy produce, and tobacco have all been torn up because of this doctrinaire faith.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This must have created a feeling in the Commonwealth that even the little bit which they are doing now is really against the doctrine of the Government and is therefore not secure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The silence of hon. Members opposite has been commented upon, and I fear that their silence is to a large extent because they feel that this is a phoney Bill, and that the physical controls will not be real. I suggest that another reason why they have not rallied to the defence of the Minister is that they feel in their hearts ashamed of the Government's whole record in this field of encouraging Commonwealth production.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>site was obviously about to enter the discussion, but I imagine that he got a black look from the Whip, and from then on not one hon. Member opposite has taken part in the discussion. Further points of substance have been put to the Minister, and, if back benchers opposite are not allowed to talk, I should have thought that the Minister would have sought to defend further his point of view. That has not been done. The queries put by my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mr. Moss) on matters of substance have been ignored. If further evidence is wanted that State trading is an advantage, we could go on giving it for a long time.</p>

	<p>I will state only one further instance, in the hope that it will bring the Minister to his feet to defend his doctrinaire policy. The Minister will be aware that wheat is lying idle in Australia and cannot be sold because we are not doing the kind of trading which we ought to be doing. The result has been import cuts, and now industry in this country is not selling its goods.</p>

	<p>I could give example after example. The Minister has not given any defence at all. He has merely advanced his doctrinaire policy. We can only think that there have been instructions, as before, from certain vested interests, and that the Government associate themselves more with those interests than with good will to the Colonies and to the domestic consumers at home.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, it would be better to take the first Amendment first and get that out of the way? As I understand it, that Amendment is little more than a drafting Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: We could dispose of the first now, and then have a debate on the next Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment agreed to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 1, to leave out paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) and to insert,
	<br><blockquote><p>(
	<i>b</i>) in cases where the Board are specially directed to do so by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (in this Act referred to as "the Minister"), of acting, either as principals or as agents of the Minister, in the purchase of Commonwealth sugar the purchase of which does not fall within the Government's said obligations.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(3) Before giving any directions for the purposes of paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) of the last preceding subsection, the Minister shall consult the Sugar
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
Board and such one or more undertakings as appear to him to be the principal importers of sugar into the United Kingdom.</p></blockquote>
I wish to remind hon. Members that there are three kinds of sugar. Broadly speaking, there is the Commonwealth negotiated price sugar; that is, the sugar covered by the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement, by which we have entered into an obligation to buy 1,568,000 tons. Then there is the Commonwealth free sugar, which is the difference between that amount, roughly speaking, and the total of the quotas which have been agreed under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement which amounts to 2,375,000 tons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have visualised that there is just a possibility that a case may arise where the Government might wish to ensure that specific quantities of Commonwealth sugar, apart from the negotiated price sugar, shall be taken up by this country. The object of these proposals is to ensure that the Sugar Board shall have reserve powers for such an occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I mentioned during the Second Reading debate, we do not think that such an occasion is likely to arise, because there is the Commonwealth preference and there is also the assurance given by the importers that they will give preference to Commonwealth sugar. Taken together, those two things, we think, will ensure that Commonwealth exporters find a ready market in the United Kingdom for the Commonwealth sugar which they have to export. At the same time, we feel that we cannot run the risk of circumstances arising where the Government felt that they should take action, but had no powers to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Accordingly, we have put forward these proposals. We visualise that these reserve powers would have to be applied only to Commonwealth sugar. But it was pointed out that that was not clear in the Bill as drafted, and we agree. To make absolutely certain that our intentions are clear we have here limited it to the Commonwealth sugar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third Amendment I mentioned just now, in page 3, line 4, is consequential on this, since it is required by the insertion we propose to make of the word "Commonwealth."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

position to enable the Amendments to the proposed Amendment to be discussed later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it would meet the convenience of the Committee if, rather than that we should have repetitive debates, we take the broad point which arises here and the point which arises in our two proposed Amendments to the Minister's Amendment, namely, to leave out from the beginning of paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) to the word "Commonwealth," and to insert "of purchasing"; and to leave out from "Board" to the end of the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that would be convenient. If we have a general debate it will be convenient. Then I should propose to give the Opposition the opportunity to move their proposed Amendments. I think that the hon. Gentleman's suggestion is a good one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The broad point we are raising by our Amendments is that if a Sugar Board is set up, it should be recognised as a Board dealing commercially with sugar. For the purpose of this argument, we do not complain about the rights of the sugar merchants to merchant sugar. But we say that if a Board is set up with this responsibility it should be given broad powers. That is the purpose of our proposed Amendments. We propose that the Sugar Board should have the power to purchase such other sugar as would appear to the Board to be expedient. We think that necessary for many reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Rochester and Chatham (Mr. Bottomley) mentioned the Wheat Agreement and I refer to it by way of illustration. Everyone knows that we are getting into great difficulties about wheat. We got out of the Wheat Agreement, and at the time I thought it unwise. Some of my colleagues agreed with me and others disagreed, but I think that, on balance, most people agreed that it was an unwise step. At any rate, everyone agrees that something must be done about world trading in wheat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position regarding sugar is much more difficult, as I have already indicated, and because we think it is a very difficult market, I cannot understand why the Minister keeps repeating his doctrinaire view. In spite of his repetition,
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
we are State trading in sugar. That is why it is disturbing when the Minister says that he does not believe in State trading. The Commonwealth Agreement is State trading, and over and above that Agreement, we have the International Sugar Agreement. This is not free enterprise at all. There is an elaborate system of quotas and price variations determined, not by ourselves, but by the International Sugar Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that situation, if we are accepting responsibility for the purchase of Commonwealth sugar at an agreed price, we should be prepared to face a contingency where it might be necessary, not through the trade, but because of Governmental responsibility both under the Commonwealth Agreement and the International Sugar Agreement, to purchase at particular prices. If we are broadly concerned with the Commonwealth price of sugar, we must accept this responsibility; because the price fluctuations will be determined by the Sugar Council and we must be prepared, in our own interests as sugar consumers, to make purchases, and the best instrument is the Sugar Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first broad point we are making—and this is the most appropriate occasion to discuss it—is that if the Government goes so far as to accept the Sugar Board, and place on it competent people with knowledge and experience of the trade, why should not those people have power to deal, both in the interests of sugar marketing generally and our particular interest as sugar consumers, and go into the market and buy? All the doctrinaire arguments against this do not apply, if we start on the first premise that we accept State buying, in the form of the Commonwealth Agreement, and orderly marketing, in the form of the International Agreement. Our first point is that we believe the Bill as drafted does not go far enough. If we recognise a Board it is better fully to recognise it and to give it full powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely it is extraordinary for the right hon. Gentleman to say, "I have just discovered that the Bill as originally drafted would have given the Board power to purchase other than under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0469">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to direction in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says, "I did not realise this at all. Here is a specific reference to my powers of direction, but we were not ever contemplating the power of buying other than Commonwealth sugar." It is extraordinary that the Bill should have received a Second Reading without that being discovered. I am not disputing the Minister's ignorance, it is not for me to do that, but I should say that someone else has been very intelligent in scrutinising the Bill and has made representations to the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dissent from what the hon. Gentleman says. Representations were made on this matter; but this is only for greater clarification of our intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must come back to the fundamental point. This is a specific power, that the Board can act on specific directions from the Minister to buy other than Commonwealth sugar. I am sure that all the lay members of the Committee realised that on reading the Bill. Now the Minister says that he wishes to clarify it, but this means what it says. This will be interpreted by the courts exactly as a layman would read the words. This would give the Board power to buy other than Commonwealth sugar. It is extraordinary that the Minister should say, "I am only clarifying the position. I shall not allow the Board to do it." Surely, the position is that strong representations were made by the trade that these words mean exactly as we understand them to mean, and that the trade said, "We shall not stand for this. We do not like the Board. We hope to get rid of it. We do not very much like the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement. We happen to be free enterprisers and we believe in free enterprise." They said, "Make this narrower. Do not allow the Sugar Board to buy any sugar other than Commonwealth sugar."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a major concession, a major retreat. There are disturbing features about the Bill. We find the Minister, or perhaps not the Minister, but his technically expert advisers—people without politics—saying that if this Sugar Board is to mean anything at all, it must be allowed to buy other sugar. It is when
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
politics come in that we get the Amendment. The draftsmen and the people who instructed them had no doubt about this from a technical point of view. They said, "If we set up a Board, of course it must have power to purchase sugar other than Commonwealth sugar." Being good Civil Servants they said, "We do not take the same view of the Board as does the hon. Member for Sunderland, North. We like to tie up the Board and allow it to act only under direction from the Minister."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not share that view. But at any rate, the experts conceded the main point, that if we set up a Board, we must allow it to act on commitments we have both under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement and under the International Agreement, and to have broad powers to purchase sugar. In fact, if we are interested in affecting the world price, and we have interests in both directions, as producers in the Commonwealth and consumers, then we must have this Board with powers to purchase. In fact, the technical experts drafting the Bill—perhaps they took a more constructive view than I have said that they took—said, "We cannot leave this to the Board. The Minister must be allowed to intervene if necessary and to give directions to the Board that in the national interest we must purchase sugar; we must play our part in avoiding these disastrous fluctuations so far as possible."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This was the measure of our good will as members of the International Sugar Council. To deal generally with the matters before us, by virtue of these Amendments, we shall, if we take the step of creating the Board to deal with sugar, accept the implications of that on good commercial grounds and say, "If you set up the Board you must have confidence in it and allow it, if necessary, to trade." Quite apart from that, we say that if our major premise is not accepted, it is very disturbing that we find the Minister taking the first opportunity to limit the powers of the Sugar Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel very strongly—I am speaking personally—and all our experience over the past few years points to it, that if we set up a Board and authorise it to deal with commercial matters, it is better to let it go ahead and not make it subject to direction. That is our third ground for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0470">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
opposing the Minister's new attitude that the Board can take action only as a result of special directions from him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dye</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It appears to me that the Minister is proposing a fundamental change in the Bill. He has failed to explain the purpose of his Amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. F. Willey) mentioned that there must have been representations to the Minister by somebody and it is as a result of that that the right hon. Gentleman wishes to amend the Bill. The Minister has not revealed his full purpose. There must be something else behind the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister told us that there are three kinds of sugar. I thought from his description that the sugar was all of one kind, but that it came under three separate heads of agreement in relation to purchase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ask ourselves whether, when the Bill was drafted, the Minister had in mind that the Government might want the Board to purchase sugar anywhere in the world for strategic purposes and to store it against an emergency. That was what I thought the Government had in mind judging by the way the Bill was drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will recollect that two or three years ago a large quantity of sugar was bought by the Ministry and stored in Norfolk. Much of it is still there—I saw some recently—stored in the open on the runways of disused airfields. I believe it was bought from Cuba, I believe the Minister paid dollars for it, and I believe it was purchased for a specific purpose which has not yet materialised. There it stands, guarded day and night lest it should be taken away by an unauthorised person. The Minister must have had a reason for doing this, although we do not know what the full reason was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At one time the Ministry saw a need for powers to buy sugar in very large quantities and store it against future needs. I thought that was what the Government had in mind in drafting the Bill. It is clear now that they want the Board to have powers to buy only sugar of Commonwealth origin, but the Minister must first ask certain other importers of sugar whether the Board is to be allowed
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
to do it. He must consult one or more importers before he can even suggest to the Board that it ought to buy additional sugar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that the Minister now seeks to place a serious limitation on the Board. In the event of a rapid deterioration in world conditions, the Board could not quietly go about its business and purchase and store sugar for strategic purposes. The Minister seeks to tie his own hands so that he must consult other interests. Presumably he will say to the other interests, "You had better not buy this cheap sugar, but we will purchase it for national purposes." The other interests will reply, "We do not consent to that. We want the cheap sugar. You must let private enterprise have the cheaper sugar, and must buy dearer sugar for your purposes." This is a flaw in the Bill which we ought not to let pass.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and the Government are losing face in the world because of their retreat before vested interests. The other day the Minister went to Rome and made a speech. When he returned he was asked about it, and he said, "It had no effect there whatsoever." We lost a seat—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I really must quarrel with the hon. Gentleman. I never said that. My speeches always have an effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dye</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That speech had an effect other than the one the Minister desired. The effect was that it appeared that the Food and Agriculture Organisation was losing faith in the policy which the Minister is pursuing of scattering his powers and then setting up a Board under such a limitation that he cannot even write a letter to it asking it to buy some sugar without first consulting other interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no wonder that our prestige in the world in relation to food is going down and that we cannot carry out, or are not fully carrying out, agreements in respect of the Commonwealth or even in respect of our farmers at home. Later on we shall see how the Minister proposes to limit the production of sugar at home, and again he must first consult vested interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important principle is involved here. The Minister is altering the nature of the Bill as a result of strong representations to him to limit the powers of the Board and leave importing interests in a position to deal with any matters relating to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0471">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
world sugar trade. The Minister was less than frank to the Committee in his very brief speech, for he gave no explanation for these fundamental changes. The Committee ought to probe his suggestions very closely before accepting the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little puzzled by the tortuous mechanism of the Minister's mind this morning. I am a simple man like he is, and I normally listen to him with affection and appreciation, but I think that this morning he has baffled both us and himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are here guaranteeing to buy about 1½ million tons of Commonwealth and Colonial sugar. That means that about one-third of the production in the Commonwealth remains to be sold on the world market. I have found the people of Barbados and others in the West Indies a little disturbed. They are competing in the world market with cheap dumped sugar from Cuba. The Cubans are in a fortunate position in that the Americans buy their sugar on most advantageous terms, and the Cubans are thus able to fix an artificially low price for world sugar. The West Indians ask where they are to sell their sugar and what they are to get for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister began by saying that he was opposed to all forms of State purchase, but he did not quote past transactions to show why he held that view. It is the view of the Opposition that it is good to give guarantees to Colonial producers about their output and good for the nation to buy in advance. The Minister does not think so, but he cannot quote experience to show that that has been disadvantageous to our economy in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will the Minister do in future? Will he in future buy, say, another 500,000 tons of sugar from Barbados or Mauritius in order to maintain the well-being of the people there? Will he keep away from Cuban sugar? Does the Amendment mean that he will merely utter fine speeches but perform no deeds in buying extra sugar available in the Commonwealth? I and people in the Colonies would like to know the answer. I hope the Minister will be more forthcoming and tell us exactly what is in his mind. I hope he will not be quite so

	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Sharples</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to reply in particular to what was said by the hon.

My family has been occupied in the sugar trade for 60 years, although I have no connection whatever with the trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member referred to the Ministry's purchase of a large quantity of Cuban sugar, and took that as his example, although I am not sure whether it was an example of the benefit of State trading or the failure of State trading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had a personal experience in connection with that transaction. I was in New York when it was being negotiated, and was staying with a Cuban producer. The news of the transaction was hailed with the greatest delight by the Cuban producers. It came completely out of the blue to them, and saved them from a very difficult situation. Whether or not it was beneficial from our point of view I do not know, but I do not think it was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Therefore, it would be convenient to discuss the right hon. Gentleman's Amendments now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0472">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
As to the question raised about the Cuban agreement, I can assure the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Sharples) that there were at the time extremely good and important reasons for making that decision. The question of storing was the responsibility of the hon. Member's own Government and he should address that point to his own Front Bench. We on this side of the Committee, when we were in office, did not get ourselves into the state of having to store a lot of sugar that we did not need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am really disturbed about the Government Amendments which we are now discussing. They are a very bad beginning to the Bill. They show straight away that the Minister is prepared to run away in front of private interests. In effect, the right hon. Gentleman said that private interests came to him and said that they did not trust him. As the Bill was drafted originally, the right hon. Gentleman had certain powers which only he could put into operation. The private interests came to him and said that that was not good enough. They said, "You must eat humble pie by taking away those powers, because we do not trust you to exercise the powers which you have given yourself." The right hon. Gentleman is getting himself into certain contradictions in his arguments. Out of friendship I would point these matters out to him so that he may decide on what leg he will stand primarily, although he may shift from one leg to another from Clause to Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman tells us that he does not like State trading, but if he is to insert in the Bill these excessive directions he will be doing none other than State trading. The right hon. Gentleman says that the operations of the Sugar Board are not State trading and therefore they are all right, but the directions which the Minister gives under the Bill bring in the State. The right hon. Gentleman should say, "I am not in favour of State trading so let the Board go its way," or "I am in favour of State trading and I must have these powers and directions which only State trading can give." The Minister says "We will set up a pretended Board and put restrictions round it and it will not be able to do anything. I will give it direct powers but the State can constantly intervene to interfere with the flow of trade."
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
The first point that I am trying to have put right by means of my Amendments is to give the Board simple power to buy Commonwealth preference sugar as distinct from Commonwealth Agreement sugar. We are glad that it is made clear that the Board can buy preference sugar, but we are against these extraordinary restrictions. The Board should have the simple power to buy Commonwealth preference sugar and should not be required to come to the State. Nor should the State have the power to interfere with the ordinary commercial transactions of the Board. Anyone who is against State trading should agree with us on this, unless they have their tongues in their cheeks. The Board should not be hedged around. The Amendment simply provides that the Board should have power to buy preference as well as Commonwealth Agreement sugar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next Amendment is designed to remove a very grave blemish in the Bill, namely a statutory obligation on the Minister to consult private interests. It is most extraordinary that the Government of our country should have a statutory obligation to do this. I can quite see that nobody would wish to stop a Minister from consulting private interests. All Governments do so. They consult trade unions and all sorts of interests, quite rightly, but it is extraordinary that it should be actually stated in a Bill which will receive the Royal Assent that a Minister is obliged by Statute to consult what are euphemistically called those who appear to him to be the principal importers of sugar. That really means those who appear to themselves to be the principal importers, because there is no other way in which one can find them. The Minister will have to accept the trade's own definition of the principal importers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That a Minister of the Crown should make this obeisance before private interests, before the real masters of the Government, is extraordinary. It is a great indignity. I would not mind if the Minister said in a speech, "I will consult private interests," but the right hon. Gentleman is going to compel by law himself and his successors, including in due course Labour Ministers, to discuss these matters with private enterprise and private interests. It is an extraordinary thing. We should all rise up and beg the Minister not to subject us to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willey</div> <!-- member -->

On this occasion, despite what the hon. Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. F. Willey) has said, it should be made clear that it was always the intention of the Minister that the reserve powers—and we underline "reserve," because that is what they are intended to be—should refer only to Commonwealth sugar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Walker</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend said on Second Reading that to make the matter quite clear he would amend the wording in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not a question that the wording of the Bill did not make that matter as clear as it might be, but that it made the exact opposite crystal clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The words proposed to be inserted will make the original intention of the Bill crystal clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: According to subsection (2, 
	<i>a</i>) we are dealing quite expressly in Commonwealth sugar, but the words in subsection (2, 
	<i>b</i>) are:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… in the purchase of other sugar …"</p></blockquote>
Therefore, to anyone who is not a lawyer those words would be taken to mean sugar other than Commonwealth sugar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the hon. Member forgets that the words "Commonwealth" is not in the original. That word was inserted this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does "other" mean? It must mean something. Other than what?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was quite in order for the right hon. Gentleman to put his argument as he did if he thought that there was something undesirable in the discussions which took place, but it was always the intention of my right hon. Friend that the word here should be "Commonwealth" and he wanted to make that perfectly clear by moving the Amendment. In view of what has been said already about the position of Commonwealth supplies, I should have thought that the Committee would have been pleased to have this insertion so that there should be no doubt at all in future that it will be the Commonwealth sugar which will have special consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) goes on to explain that, in the unlikely event of this reserve power having to be used, the Minister will consult with the Sugar Board and the principal importers of sugar in this country. Hon. and right hon. Members opposite wax quite indignant about this, but I should have thought it an obvious prerequisite to the making of any decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But not statutory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How often do we not say in Bills, "After consulting such bodies as are in his opinion representative of the industry"? That is only another way of saying what we are saying in the Amendment. If one considers the practical matters which will arise if this decision has to be made, it is proper and sensible that the Minister should have to take the views of the Board, which by that time will have had experience of these matters, and the views of importers who know the details of the trade and can give him the benefit of that experience before a decision is made. Should occasion arise when the Minister has to use these special powers, it is common sense that before exercising the prerogative he should discuss the situation in some detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does this mean that the Minister is categorically saying that, if we need to buy 250,000 or 500,000 tons for the home market, we should definitely buy Commonwealth sugar and not Cuban sugar or sugar from some outside source of supply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0474">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The Amendment makes it clear that sugar bought by the Board as a principal under a Minister's directive will be Commonwealth sugar. This only refers to the position in which the Board is buying as a principal. If the nation wanted to give free sugar to children at Christmas, or after or just before an Election, the Government could entrust the Board to buy as their agent, but when the Board is buying as a principal the Amendment provides that the sugar should be Commonwealth sugar. That is the whole point of inserting the words in the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the people who normally would be buying would be the principal refiners in this country. It is fair to say that no one knows more about the conditions surrounding the trade than do those people, and to use the special powers without attempting to seek their advice would be, on the face of it, a wrong thing to do. The Clause, after all, merely declares that the Minister will consult. [HON. MEMBERS: "Shall."] Very well, "shall consult," but having consulted them the final decision still rests with the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank goodness. If it did not, we should be in a state.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The final word will remain with the Minister and we are inserting in the Bill only words similar to those in other Bills. It is a common sense arrangement. Nobody knows better than the hon. Member for Sunderland, North, who had to deal with this matter for so long, what practical difficulties arise. The hon. Gentleman surely should concede that these practical considerations should be taken into account and should figure in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the Government Amendment in page 3, line 4, we feel that having inserted the word "Commonwealth" we ought to define what Commonwealth sugar is. As we shall be meeting the term on many occasions in the course of discussing the Bill, perhaps something should be said about it now. We meant sugar coming from those territories which took part in the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement. As the Committee knows, at present the main territories are Australia, the British West Indies, Fiji, Mauritius and South Africa. To avoid any problems for people who may read these words, I should say that the term "British West Indies" for this
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
purpose includes British Guiana but excludes the Bahamas. British Honduras and Grenada are minor members. That is what is meant when one speaks of Commonwealth sugar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Joint Parliamentary Secretary say something to the Committee about the methods by which these consultations between the Sugar Board and other interests would take place? What actually would happen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must apply our common sense. If the Minister felt that an extreme situation had arisen he would take the normal steps. We do not expect such a situation to arise, for it is a most unlikely possibility, but we must take proper precautions. If he felt that he must make use of his power of directive, he would take the normal steps, such as an invitation through the usual channels, if we can use that phrase in another connection, to the members of the Board, to the refiners and to others who deal in sugar. He would approach those whom he knows to have personal and practical experience in this matter. The consultation would be similar to that with heads of Departments, of which hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite have knoweldge. It would be a question of sharing the minds of people whose job it is to deal with the commodity every minute of every day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still not quite clear. Probably I am a little obtuse. I want to know whether these interests will be consulted separately or at a conference. If it is at a conference, it is important to know what the representation will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think I could give a clear answer. It could well be that a refiners' association or some other group of people would be called together as a group, but it could also be that various sections of the industry, with special knowledge of one part of the world, would be approached privately. I do not think we can tie any future Minister by saying that he must talk to them 
	<i>en masse</i> or that he must talk to them separately. It could be either. The reason we do not need to define the way in which it shall be done—as a syndicate or individually—is that this is a reserve power which we do not expect will be needed. If it is used, the Minister will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0475">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
exercise his common sense in the contacts which he makes to ensure that he takes the right decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my right hon. and hon. Friends will agree when I say that this debate is running in a most unsatisfactory manner. The Committee is not being treated with the respect which it deserves. My right hon. and hon. Friends have raised points of great substance which have not been answered. Doubtless the Joint Parliamentary Secretary has done his best, but I am sure my right hon. Friend the Member for Smethwick (Mr. Gordon Walker) will pursue him further in order to ensure that the points of substance which have been raised are answered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I played a part in the Cuban Sugar Agreement, for I was the unfortunate Minister who had to go to the West Indies to explain to them that the Cuban Sugar Agreement would not harm them. We consulted the West Indies, the Commonwealth interests and the home interests, and we therefore did all that was possible to ensure that the purpose of the Cuban Agreement was clear to all those concerned. The purpose was to get sugar off the ration, and the fact that the subsequent Government took up the Agreement is an indication that it served the country in the best possible way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sharples</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be a relief to the right hon. Member to know that I was referring to the Cuban Agreement of 1953.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a continuation of the previous Agreement. I am sure the hon. Gentleman is right in criticising the Minister and saying that the sugar bought under that Agreement is stored in a way which is not beneficial. I am not against storing; I believe we must carry stocks. Nevertheless, the Government are foolish—or it may have been deliberate—to take the sugar to an area where we understand it is not even in the refiners' warehouses. The sugar was bought at heavy cost in dollars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This indicates that the Government are half-hearted about State trading. That has been admitted time and again, but here we have an indication that even when they take on the job, as they intend to do under the Bill, they will be halfhearted and will not do it properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
The interests which made representations have already influenced the Minister. I agree that it is quite right that, upon the publication of a Bill, the interests concerned—not only hon. Members but the public and other interests whom the Bill will affect most prominently—have a right to make representations. In this instance, however, it seems to me that in the case of one particular section of vested interests, which clearly would not have made representations unless it were of benefit to them, immediately the Minister has acceded to their request, probably even against the best advice which could be given. As my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. F. Willey) says, the form in which a Department presents a Bill originally is the best technical form. As my hon. Friend said, the Department drafted the Bill so that the power was still vested in the Department, because the Minister had authority to give directions. It is a matter of debate whether that is good or bad. Generally, I think it is good, but my hon. Friend takes a different view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our view the debate this morning has run in a most unsatisfactory manner, and unless we get more information from the Minister we shall not be satisfied. I think that on reflection he will agree that none of the points of substance has been answered and that he ought to do something to meet the wishes of this side of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeger</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not satisfied by the explanation by the Joint Parliamentary Secretary about the consultations to be held with
	<br><blockquote><p>"such one or more undertakings as appear to him to be the principal importers of sugar into the United Kingdom."</p></blockquote>
It has been said that this is common-form phraseology similar to that in other Bills. That may be so, but I am rather suspicious of this tying down of the Minister by commercial interests outside, How far is he to be the agent of the Government and of the Government's policy and how far is he to be master in his own house? How far is he to be under the orders and suggestions implied in these consultations with the commercial interests outside?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that the history of previous Conservative Ministers of Agriculture suggests that outside interests have been brought to bear upon them, sometimes
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0476">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
adversely, and that that is why there have been so many removals from that office. It may be necessary in the Conservative Party to tie down future Ministers in this way, but the arrangement of consultation is not as common as the Joint Parliamentary Secretary tried to make out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By way of illustration, I will tell the Committee that I had a letter this morning from the National Farmers' Union head office complaining that, in connection with the national flax scheme, which the Government have decided to terminate, the National Farmers' Union has not been consulted. Although the phraseology may be common-form and it may be natural for any Government or Minister to consult all the main interests in the commercial, industrial and trade union world—any Minister who did not undertake all the necessary consultations would be foolish and would be depriving himself of the expert advice available in all fields of life in this country—to tie the Minister down in these words seems to me almost putting a chain or a pair of handcuffs on him in order to force him to do what would be a perfectly natural process if the circumstances were such as to suggest that line of conduct to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is unnecessary phraseology, and perhaps the Minister or his hon. Friend will give further consideration to it and explain it a little more closely. At present it seems as though some outside influence has been brought to bear, forcing the Minister to comply with the wishes of those who have an interest in the industry. Does the Minister consider that this phraseology gives him a free hand or does he think that he is being forced to conform to a mould and a pattern—perhaps a sugar mould—laid down by the outside interests? I shall be glad if he will clarify the issue before we vote on the Amendment, as we shall if his explanation is unsatisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dye</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not have risen to take the discussion further had it not been that in the course of the discussion we seem to have discovered by devious ways the reasons for the Amendment. It is quite clear from the speech of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Sharples) and the Joint Parliamentary Secretary that what caused the Government to introduce the Amendment was
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
that in 1953 they burned their fingers over the Cuban Agreement. They have been cluttered up with a lot of sugar which they did not want and which has been very costly to them. Questions have been asked about it and unsatisfactory answers given. People going about their ordinary tasks in Norfolk have seen this great quantity of sugar still stored under tarpaulins, and this has forced the Government to the conclusion that no Minister must be allowed to do such a thing again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because the Government burned their fingers so badly the Minister's hands must now be tied behind his back and he must leave the interests of the nation in sugar in the hands of private enterprise, which is to be free to act as it likes. When the Minister wants to give a direction he must consult the firms. Having consulted those firms, it would be stupid of him not to do what they told him to do. If he did not, it would be open to the firms to communicate with hon. Members, who could ask Questions and ascertain that, having consulted Messrs. So-and-So and having been given advice, the Minister, in a headstrong way, and in spite of the mistakes of 1953, has acted contrary to the firms' advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once it has been made a statutory obligation to consult the firms, how can any Minister ever get out of it in the House when it is known that he consulted the firms and then acted contrary to their advice? He could not possibly get out of it. This advice would not be given in secret. It is not being laid down that these negotiations shall be secret or that they shall be confidential. Next day in the Press the firms which the Minister has consulted can tell everybody their advice to him. They can do that in the Press, or even on the wireless if it does not fall within the 14-day rule. It can be made known throughout the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeger</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might also be made known through the mouth of Mr. Cube by being printed on the sugar bags.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dye</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to develop the argument about the propaganda to be carried out by any of these firms which the Minister is compelled to consult. It seems to me that we are placing the Minister in the position in which, instead of having a sweet after his lunch, he is made to eat humble pie. That is an invidious position for any Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0477">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
The Minister could have said, "Because of our past mistakes we will not burn our fingers again on hot sugar. We will be very careful not to do that and we will consult others." Instead of that, these firms can have a copy of the Act in their offices and can say, "At any time we might be consulted by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and he will have to do whatever we tell him."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a humiliating position in which to put the Minister. We ask the Minister to think again on the Amendment before he asks the Committee to adopt it. He should have a longer think to see if there are not some better Amendments which he could put down at a later stage of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not the kind of provision which we should lightly put into a Bill, bearing in mind the importance which sugar has played in British politics in the past. Over the past century, sugar has been hot politics at times, not only in this country but in other countries outside the Commonwealth. Before we tie the hands of the Minister in this way further thought ought to be given to the matter. I hope that the Minister will reconsider the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are three points with which I want to deal. The first relates to the Amendments in the name of the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends. I should like to point out that they would in effect give the Board 
	<i>carte blanche</i> to buy any sugar that it felt inclined to buy in addition to that bought at the Commonwealth negotiated price. That would be diametrically opposed to the object of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I explained on Second Reading, and again today, our object in setting up this Board is to limit its function very narrowly. It is not our policy to make the Board a full trading Board. The Board is to be set up with the specific object of fulfilling our obligations under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement, with an absolute minimum of trading involved. It would make absolute nonsense of that object if we were, by these Amendments, to give the Board full trading powers to buy any sugar which it felt inclined to buy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
In so far as right hon. and hon. Members opposite have expressed their views about the Amendments in the name of my hon. Friends and myself, I cannot understand their objections to them because I should have thought that the effect was simply to underline the importance of Commonwealth preference sugar. It is just that, yet they seem to be violently opposed to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman the Member for Norfolk, South West (Mr. Dye) mentioned the sugar stored in his area. It is true that we have sugar stored under tarpaulins. I am advised that that is a perfectly satisfactory way of storing sugar. That sugar is regularly inspected and turned over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dye</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does it cost?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would only say that the total reserve of sugar which we hold at the present time is not, in my opinion, excessive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A point was made about consultations. I personally (believe that it should be laid down that the Minister should consult before giving directions. I think that is a sound policy. A Minister who gives directions and consults afterwards, or does not consult at all, is doing something very silly. In this case there is a specific reason why I think this is desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of this provision is to enable the Minister to do something about it, as a last resort, if he finds that in practice and in fact Commonwealth sugar is not being taken up in this country; but before doing something about it, it is surely right and sound policy to consult the trade and to satisfy himself that there is no way in which this sugar can be taken up without direct Ministerial intervention. Our object here is to ensure discussion with the trade, and if anything goes wrong to see if we can put it right in some way other than by the Minister's direct intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we have had a full and interesting debate on this subject, and I am sorry that I do not appear to have succeeded in convincing hon. Gentlemen opposite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister knows quite well why he has not convinced us. It is remarkable that he should know that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0478">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
before I have replied, and it is, therefore, obvious that he was not convinced by what he himself said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intervene to save the good name of Parliamentary draftsmen, but before I speak on that matter I should like to say something about the extraordinary theory of the Joint Parliamentary Secretary—the sprinkler theory. He is saying that, in his view, this provision is not serious. He is saying: "It is no more serious than sprinklers. We know that they will never be used."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am merely suggesting that when one has sprinklers and all the other precautions against fire, one still takes out a fire insurance policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still at a loss to understand the theory. It is now a theory of sprinklers and fire insurance. I am looking at the fire insurance. The fire insurance is to give powers to the Board to deal with sugar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Joint Parliamentary Secretary now takes the view that even with sprinklers we need something more, and that obviously, with the world sugar trade as it is, a Board purchasing on behalf of the State should have more powers. The idea of insurance is just the idea which I have at the back of my mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I come to the defence of Parliamentary draftsmen I should like to deal with the points which the Minister has made. He is back primarily on the point that he is going to insist in saying throughout our proceedings, "I do not like this and I am doing it as lightly as I am driven to do." I beg the Minister to realise that what he is saying is that he does not like the Commonwealth Agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, yes. The Commonwealth Agreement is State trading, negotiations between States and price fixing, All the Board does is to buy at prices which Her Majesty's Government have determined. If that is not State trading I do not know what is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman keeps on saying, "Look here"—he appears to do it with regret and great modesty—"we happen to be committed to this matter of State trading." As my right hon. Friend the Member for Smethwick (Mr.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
Gordon Walker) said, we have got out of most of our other Commonwealth commitments. The Minister is saying, "Whatever else I do in the Bill, I am going to make quite sure that it does not go one iota beyond my present commitment." We are entitled to make the comment that that is why he does not like it. That is why we feel perfectly justified in coming back to this point. We are not satisfied that the Government have a genuine conviction in Commonwealth trading in the form that it takes in the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say something about consultations. Does the right hon. Gentleman realise that he is specifically providing here for consultations only with the trade? Are they the only people affected? If there are to be consultations, and this is to be written into the Bill, why do not we provide that there should be consultations with the Commonwealth interest?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not affected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can say with equal conviction that it could be affected. Surely Commonwealth interest ought to have a hearing on the question of whether the Board can come in and buy Commonwealth sugar outside the sugar for which the price is fixed. I cannot see why we should say quite empirically, as the Minister says, that this has nothing to do with the Commonwealth, and that they have other ways of making representation. I should very much like the Commonwealth to be consulted. The principal importers are consulted because they have the producer's point of view to put forward, and they are entitled to be heard by the Minister at that point. But there is someone else, not without importance, the consumer. If the Minister is saying that we must consult the principal importers, then I would say that he should be bound to consult the consumer interests. This is not without precedent. The Minister says that it is not without precedent for the Minister to be bound to make consultations. What is quite without precedent is to be bound to make consultation with one interested party only, to ignore the Commonwealth interests, the producer's interest and the consumer's interest. These are interests which the importers did not mention when they met the right hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
interest. The principal importers would never think, "If we are entitled to be heard, so by the very nature of these consultations, are the consumers." That is disturbing enough, but one realises that when one is in a trade one sees events from the point of view of how they affect that trade. What alarms me is that the Minister should have seen the situation in the same way. Did it never strike the Minister that he should see across the table and not cower behind it? The importers drove the Minister into a corner. They said, "We are not satisfied with your assurance. We are not satisfied with 'may.' Write it into the Bill, and make it mandatory." The Minister has a final line of defence. He never thought of saying, "If I give way to you, I will at any rate do what is invariably done and ensure that all the interests are consulted." That is really the disturbing feature.

I will not say anything about storage because we may have opportunities later to say something about this puzzling problem of sugar, and where it is. So far as I know, the sugar is still littered about Continental ports in barges and other handy places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point which puzzles me most, and on which I want to say a few words, concerns Parliamentary draftsmen. I want to say a few words in their favour. When I referred to paragraph (
	<i>a</i>), the Joint Parliamentary Secretary said that they had just written into paragraph (
	<i>a</i>), the word "Commonwealth." I want to remind the Committee what was provided before that Amendment, and the purpose of the Government's own Amendment. The words were:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… of purchasing sugar, at prices periodically negotiated in accordance with the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement, in fulfilment of the Government's contractual obligations under that agreement …"</p></blockquote>
That is plain. The purpose of the Government's Amendment is to make clear that under the Clause the Board purchases only Commonwealth sugar and is not empowered to purchase other sugar at Commonwealth conditions. The words are clear enough. Here the Board is charged with the duty of purchasing Commonwealth sugar. The paragraph which the Government wish to delete says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… of acting, either as principals or as agents of tie Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
and Food … in the purchase of other sugar in accordance with general or special directions given to the Board from time to time by the Minister."</p></blockquote>
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, it is quite clear that no Parliamentary draftsman is so inept as to draft such a special subsection. I know that there was talk about gremlins in the Treasury, but I have never suspected that there were gremlins among Parliamentary draftsmen because they are tidy, particular and meticulous. There was no point in doing it unless it was to make clear that the Board would be empowered with the duty of purchasing, if the Minister so directed. I am not disputing what the Minister has said, but all that can be due only to the fact that non-political people dealing with this problem realised, given a very broad political instruction, that it was absolutely necessary for the Board to have these powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is something else which the Committee has overlooked, and it is of vital importance. This is not the only Amendment. I would call to the attention of hon. Gentlemen that under the Clause as it stood the expression was, "general of special directions." That has gone; was that an accident? Was that a little wayward playfulness on the part of the Parliamentary draftsmen? What we have now is made more abundantly clear, so that sugar importers should realise what it means. There is no dubiety about it. I am not using the expression offensively when I say that now it is in ordinary rather than legal language, so that it may be clear to anyone that there has been a fundamental change in this regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's Amendment begins with the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"in cases where the Board are specially directed to do so …"</p></blockquote>
This is a major change. Not only that, but the Minister has gone out of his way, with the help of the Parliamentary draftsmen, to make clear to those whom he saw that the change is there. This is very important regarding the point of consultation. As the Clause is at present drafted, the Minister can give general directions. Under the Minister's Amendment the Board cannot buy a sack of sugar without going to the principal importers, because the Board has to be specially directed to do so by the Minister. What is the position? It is really quite indefensible. The Board are precluded by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0480">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
this decision from considering the purchase of sugar, apart from the mechanical purchase of sugar under the Commonwealth Agreement. But the Minister is allowed to contemplate the desirability of such a course. In other words, because of our commitments under the International Sugar Agreement, because of our relations in the Commonwealth, it is conceded that the Minister can consider the purchase of sugar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the Minister to do? He has to go to the principal importers before he goes to the Board, and that, I think, is indefensible. In other words, the Minister thinks that for the purpose of the world price, for the purpose of stability in the Commonwealth and because of difficulties in this or that Colony, the Government should purchase, but the importers have made the right hon. Gentleman get down on his bended knees and agree to two things. They have said to him, "Yes, we do not like you doing that, because we hope you are sincere in saying that you do not like Government responsibility to Commonwealth producers. That is our job. We exact from you these two very material concessions. First, you write it in the Bill that you consult with us, and secondly, you do not do anything in the country's interests or, in the strategic interests in the country about purchasing sugar unless you first come to us." As my right hon. and hon. Friends have said, if the Minister once goes to the importers, he will find it difficult not to purchase sugar through them. We know that the sugar trade is well-equipped to exercise public pressure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regard this as a quite intolerable position into which the Minister has got himself—for Her Majesty's Government to say, "We have reluctantly agreed to this because it is inevitable; we have Commonwealth Agreement conditions and we must, in the national interest and in the Commonwealth interest, reserve to ourselves the right to purchase sugar, yet we will write into the Bill which we put before a Standing Committee that we will only do that after consulting with the principal importers in the trade." I hope, for those reasons, that the right hon. Gentleman will feel re-invigorated, will feel that he is in a better climate here, and that it would be proper, respectable and decent for the Government to say, "We are not going to be tied up in this
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
way by private interests. We recognise, so far as sugar is concerned, that we have both Commonwealth and strategic interests to consider and we will deal with sugar within the limits of those interests."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. A. E. Oram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to say something about the question of consultation. I think that the Minister is quite entitled to have it in one of two ways. He can either make up his own mind about these directions without having any statutory obligation to consult with anyone, or he can lay down such obligations provided that he is obliged to consult all the interests concerned. What he is not entitled to ask the Committee to agree to is that there shall be a statutory obligation to consult with one sectional interest and not with all the interests concerned. It appears to me that that proposal is wrong, in that it is obliging him to consult with those people whose main purpose in life is to make money out of importing sugar. As has been said by my hon. Friends, I think that at least he should consult also with those who are footing the bill, those who eat the sugar and pay the price that will be determined by the arrangements made under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When later on we discuss the surcharge which the Bill will impose we shall find that it will be the consumer who will be called on to foot the bill. It seems to me perfectly justifiable that at this stage and on the question of from where sugar is to be purchased, and probably at what price, the people who, in the long run, will have to pay ought also to be consulted. I think the Minister would be well advised to consider this matter again and either bring in an Amendment leaving out this Clause dealing with consultation, or bring in a Clause which gives us a much wider basis for consultation. I think that he will command the agreement of hon. Members on this side of the Committee on either of those proposals, but not on the course which he proposes to adopt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to return to the attitude of the Minister towards this question. He owes an explanation to the Committee, because he has shown a fundamental contradiction in his approach to it. The right hon. Gentleman says that he is opposed to State trading and bulk purchase. But when we go beyond that, and suggest that he is opposed to this Commonwealth Sugar Agreement, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1955-1956V001P0I0481">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
right hon. Gentleman shows the most remarkable tenderness. He objects to my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Willey) suggesting that. He says that he is in favour of the bulk purchase of sugar. Why is it that the right hon. Gentleman has destroyed and scuttled all the other bulk purchase agreements, and yet, in this one instance, he is so remarkably tender about it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman and his Government are parties to this. The Tory Party, the alleged Party of Empire, boasted at the hustings and fought the Socialists, the Liberals and anyone else because, allegedly, we have not that tender solicitude and attachment to the cause of our overseas cousins. Yet this morning the right hon. Gentleman objected when we made this suggestion to him. Is that because of complications in the Commonwealth? Is it because he fears that there will be political, social and economic disturbances in the Colonies? If so, this argument will apply to cocoa, pyrethrum, sisal, wheat, hemp and to any other commodity for which we in the Mother Country ought to guarantee a market for the dependant peoples overseas. Is this the "one ewe lamb" of the right hon. Gentleman?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fail to understand why, since 1951, he and his Government have been steadily nibbling, chiselling and hacking away at all the Agreements which we made when we were in power. This may be circumlocution, because the right hon. Gentleman is a man of modest and likeable manner. We all like him, and yet he has taken part in all those sinister acts against what we did, except on this one occasion. I have watched the right hon. Gentleman since he assumed office, back in 1952, and I am worried about the complex and tortuous working of his mind this morning. For him of all people this is a most machiavellian approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Being a simple man myself and liking the right hon. Gentleman to talk simply to me in plain and simple concepts and, if I may say so, with very clear mental images, I am disturbed at his whole outlook and attitude towards us this morning. I beg of him to think again about this matter and to be a little more forthcoming. I ask the right hon. Gentleman to be a little clearer and to give us more satisfaction than he has done during the last two hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two points which I wish to make and I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will be able to answer them at the next sitting of the Committee. I notice that he was shaking his head when my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Willey) said that this was a matter which could concern, and closely concern, the Commonwealth producers. Why the right hon. Gentleman should shake his head, when we are dealing with Commonwealth sugar which falls within the Government's obligations, I do not know. The right hon. Gentleman has said that he would never dream of interfering with the Board, except in a critical situation, and that means some situation affecting the Commonwealth producers and no one else. I hope that he will tell us why, in his view, this does not concern Commonwealth producers and, therefore, why there is no need to bring them in among the people who should be consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point is that we all like the right hon. Gentleman very much, but I like him better when he is not being too embarrassed. What he is pretending at the moment is that he is only clarifying something which he knew was there all the time. Can the right hon. Gentleman answer precisely what is the meaning of "(
	<i>b</i>)"? What does the word "other" mean? It is not a technical term. We all use it and understand it. It means other than something—but other than what? Will the right hon. Gentleman tell us at the next sitting of the Committee? Otherwise he is not clarifying something, he is contradicting something, and he is open to the charge that he is doing so because he is under great pressure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the right hon. Gentleman also say why he has left out the word "general"? He must meet that point. If he is only clarifying the thing, he has to say that the word "special" means the same as "general or special," which is a hard argument to sustain. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will tell us what "(
	<i>b</i>)" means. We are moving to leave it out, but he should not only tell us what is meant by what is to be inserted; he should also tell us what is meant by what it is proposed to leave out. Then he will find it rather harder to say that this is a clarifying Amendment and he will have to admit, as we urged in our argument, that under pressure this is a complete

change by him of the elements in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was hoping that the Minister would rise to answer the number of important points which have been put to him. I observed that he was taking careful note of all that hon. Members have said, and the right hon. Gentleman knows very well that had he risen now he would have secured the floor at the next sitting of the Committee. But we are up against an example of a general principle which has been at work in the last few years in regard to the Government. I have in mind particularly the
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
question of consultation, about which several of my hon. Friends have spoken.
