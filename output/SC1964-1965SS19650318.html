	<div class='title'>Clause 1.—(EXTENSION OF SECTION 412 TO COUNTIES. 1892 c. 55.)</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As hon. Members will have observed, there is only one Amendment on the Notice Paper. It is starred, and therefore I do not propose to select it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forbes Hendry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I am sorry to have to appear to take steps to impede consideration of the Bill, but it seems to me, Mr. McInnes, that it is not competent for the Committee to consider the Bill at this stage, in that the Bill seeks to impose a charge upon public funds and is, therefore, not competently considered by the Committee without a Money Resolution passed by a Committee of the whole House. This is a very highly technical matter, depending upon the nature of the charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill seeks to provide that property found in the landward areas of counties should be dealt with in certain ways. It seems to me that the Bill will, in that way or might in that way, interfere with the right of the Crown to treasure trove—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What an imagination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:—when the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act, 1892, the principal Act which it seeks to apply—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How long does a point of order last?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will determine that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will explain the point of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Act provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every person finding any goods, articles or money shall report the fact and deposit such
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
goods, articles or money with the chief constable or other officer acting for him within forty-eight hours".</p></blockquote>
Then it goes on to say what happens to these goods, articles or money if certain things do not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Common Law of Scotland provides that articles which are lost are the property of the Crown. I had no desire to waste the time of the Committee on this matter and therefore I will confine myself to the fewest possible authorities on the point. In Gloag and Henderson's 
	<i>Introduction to the Law of Scotland</i> we find that
	<br><blockquote><p>"treasure discovered hidden in the ground the ownership of which cannot be traced"</p></blockquote>
belongs not to the finder but to the Crown. It goes on to say—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is taking the opportunity of a point of order to deal with the merits of the Bill. He will have an opportunity of doing so by following the ordinary procedure. At the moment I am not prepared to allow him to deal with the merits of the Bill. In regard to the Money Resolution, that has been considered by the authorities of the House. It is common practice for there to be no Money Resolution when the amount of public money involved is insignificant. In the circumstances I am not prepared to allow the hon. Member to proceed to deal with the merits of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, I think it right to point out that the amount involved may be very considerable indeed. Recently there was a very considerable amount of litigation on the subject of treasure trove found in the landward area of the County of Shetland which caused—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That may be the opinion of the hon. Member, but I have it here authoritatively that the amount of money involved is very little indeed. It has been the common practice of the House that there shall be no Money Resolution when the amount of public money is so insignificant. Mr. Manuel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry), who is a sponsor of the Bill, is trying to improve it. I hope we shall not take too long on points which have no substance. I appreciate the good will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0325">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
which was shown in all parts of the House, and which has resulted in the Bill's reaching the Committee without too much difficulty. I hope also that the Committee recognises that this Measure is desired by local authorities and that it is uncontroversial. I hope such recognition will result in our Committee being not too prolonged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very small Measure, amending Section 412 of the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act, 1892. So that hon. Members can get an idea of the purpose of the Bill I will read out the Section in the Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member will confine his remarks to the Question which is before the Committee, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. McInnes, and I crave your indulgence for my opening remarks which I made in order to show my indebtedness to hon. Members who have turned up here this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 412 reads as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every person finding any goods, articles or money shall report the fact and deposit such goods, articles or money with the chief constable or other officer acting for him, within forty-eight hours after the same shall have been found by such person and every person failing so to report and to deposit shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding five pounds: Provided always, that if the owner of such goods, articles or money shall not claim the same and prove his ownership to the satisfaction of the magistrate within six months from the date of such report and deposit the magistrate may award the same to the finder, under deduction of the expenses incurred in advertising for the owner; and where the owner shall appear and prove his ownership as aforesaid the magistrate shall order such goods, articles or money to be delivered to such owner, under deduction of such expenses and of such reward to the finder as in the circumstances the magistrate shall determine; Provided also that if the owner of the same do not prove his ownership and the finder cannot within six months and after notice be found, the magistrate may order such goods or articles to be sold and the proceeds thereof, or if the subject be money, such money, to be applied to the purposes of this Act.</p></blockquote>
The Clause—this point should appeal to every Member of the Committee—has been requested by the County Councils Association of Scotland. Subsection (1) applies Section 412 to the landward areas of counties in Scotland; previously it has applied only to burghs.
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
The subsection substitutes the justice of the peace court or the sheriff for the magistrates, since there are, of course, no magistrates in landward areas. Reference to the sheriff is required because in some areas justices of the peace do not exist effectively. The police will use their discretion in deciding how to apply the formula laid down in the Bill. I would point out that it already works successfully under local legislation in Lanarkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) provides that the proceeds of the sale of goods in accordance with Section 412 should be applied to the county fund for use in connection with police purposes. This is the nearest equivalent to applying the money "for the purposes of the Act", as is stated in the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act, 1892.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some hon. Members may object to legislation by reference in applying Section 412 to the counties, instead of by re-enacting all these things in full. The reasons for drafting the Bill in this way are to make it simpler, and to emphasise that the purpose is to make the law exactly the same in the counties as in the burghs, with only essential modifications. Thirdly, the language of Section 412 is somewhat old-fashioned, but redrafting along modern lines would not be within the scope of a Private Member's Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The County Councils Association wants the Bill, and I am the medium of trying to bring it about. I should be delighted if every hon. Member, especially those representing county areas, would concur in the views which I have put forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Campbell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I, with your indulgence, Mr. McInnes, congratulate the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel)—we have not had an opportunity of doing so before—on having produced this Measure, which is welcome to the authorities concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be grateful for the hon. Member's guidance in respect of subsection (2) where it says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"such money, shall be applied to the county fund for use in connection with police purposes."</p></blockquote>
Can he tell us what "in connection with police purposes" means and to what extent that is restricted? What does he intend by those words?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0326">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very good question. Those who have been in local authority work know that there is a police fund and it is rate-levied in order to make up the proportion which is necessary to run the police services, but after a grant from the Government which I think runs at about 60 per cent. of the total oncost. It is between that and 100 per cent. of the sum required. There is a rate account. The money mentioned in the Bill will go into the rate account to help it. I understand that the sums are insignificant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must make it clear at the outset that I thoroughly support the Bill. I am not in any way critical of it but I am anxious to get information, which I hope to obtain from the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland who is with us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is much more far-reaching than the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) realises, and it makes a very material change in the law of Scotland relating to treasure trove. This is a matter of very great importance. Within the last few years a considerable amount of treasure has been found on one of the islands of Shetland. It was of great historical, artistic and intrinsic value. Shetland County Council decided that the treasure was the property of the people of Shetland and the treasure was sent to the University of Aberdeen. It was displayed and promptly returned. It was stated that the treasure was the property of the Crown and not of the people of Shetland. Ultimately the courts found that the treasure was the property of the Crown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that the Bill will serve a useful purpose, which its sponsor probably did not realise, in that it will provide that, in future cases of this sort, treasure trove will belong to the finder and not to the Crown. I hope that the Under-Secretary will be able to give us some guidance on this point. I hope, too, that he will consider whether, even at this late stage, he should introduce an Amendment to provide for the restoration of the Shetland treasure—which is now in Edinburgh—to the University of Aberdeen, which is the custodian appointed by the finders of the treasure. This is a matter of great
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
importance, which ought to receive some consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not have the advantage of the advice of the Lord Advocate. Unfortunately, the party opposite does not seem to be able to find any Scottish lawyer who is willing to become a Member of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member give way a moment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. This is Committee stage. It seems to me that this is a matter of paramount importance to the Kingdom of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join with other hon. Members in congratulating the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) upon the introduction of the Bill. I give him every good wish for its speedy and successful passage. A large part of my constituency would be covered by the extension of the Burgh Police Act as proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the hon. Member will indicate what it is that we are replacing—if we are replacing anything at all—in the county council areas. I agree that it makes logical sense to have the same system of lost property disposal and recovery in the county areas and in the burghs, but I should like to know what the present position is in the county areas in this respect. I should be grateful if the hon. Member can give me just an outline of the situation, if only to assure me that we are not disposing of something which might be quite worth while in itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the hon. Member give serious consideration to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry)? If we are changing the whole legal status of treasure trove we should give careful thought to the wisdom of doing so. As a layman only I would have thought that treasure trove did not come within the definition of lost property—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member would be quite right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:—because it is found property. There is a world of difference between the two. Perhaps we can have an explanation of that point. It is proper to inquire what the position is, because
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0327">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
we would not want to change the state of law governing treasure trove merely by accident.

In line 14, I cannot see the purpose of the second comma, after the second "money". Perhaps the hon. Member can say whether or not that is a misprint.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I mentioned the Duke, but I thought that this was within the scope of the debate because the question of treasure trove has been raised. If the question applies to the treasure trove which has been found in the Shetlands it must also apply to that which is alleged to lie in Tubermory Bay. So far nobody his disputed the right of the Duke to that treasure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the fact that the Tobermory Bay treasure is not treasure trove? Is it not in fact the property of the Duke, in that it was given by the Crown to a predecessor of the Duke? It is not treasure trove or lost property, or found property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That point has never been acknowledged. I thought that the question would come within the compass of the point raised by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that it was formally signed away by the Crown.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join with other hon. Members in welcoming the Bill. Like all the other sponsors, I fully approve of its every detail, having carefully gone into it before putting my name to it. As a former landward member of a county council for 15 years I appreciate the necessity for the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one point which it would benefit the Committee to have explained.
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Can we be told what procedure is adopted in relation to the advertising of this property? If there is any weakness in the present procedure—certainly in some areas—it is that adequate advertisement of found property is not carried through. I should like to know whether the hon. Member considers that the Bill makes sufficient provision for this point. It is only too easy for something to be lost outwith the area in which one lives, and for it to be very difficult to trace unless traced by some advertisement which is available, not only to the loser of the property, but to the police of the area in which it has been lost, or of that in which it has been found.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Hill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that, with his experience, the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) does not know the difference between treasure trove and lost property. Even in a burgh, treasure trove is treasure trove, and is claimed by the Crown. When I was on the local council in Musselburgh and we were developing a site we came upon a pot of treasure trove. The Crown authorities made no bones about the ownership of that treasure. It consisted of coins of James I and Elizabeth I. The authorities took it to London, picked out the best of it, and sent us back the rest. I support the Bill because I have been a joint member of a burgh and a county authority and I feel that it is time that something was done to make it easier for county authorities to dispose of lost property. It is lost property which we are discussing, and not treasure trove. I hope that the Bill will reach the Statute Book very soon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a landward county councillor I join hon. Members on both sides of the Committee in giving the Bill my very warm support. I am also a member of a joint police committee, and I can speak for the police forces of Scotland in saying that they also give the Bill their warm support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, East (Miss Harvie Anderson) mentioned the question of advertising. It must be remembered that such advertising can be extremely expensive. A small advertisement applying for a job may cost £20, £30 or £40 in a national newspaper, for only one or two insertions. Such a cost may be far in excess of the value of the property lost. We must,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0328">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
therefore, approach this problem with great care. Generally, however, I warmly support the Bill and congratulate the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) upon bringing it in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to intervene again, but the hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. J. Hill) seems to be under a misapprehension about the Bill. Section 412 of the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act, 1892, does not deal with lost property; it deals with found property. The Section refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every person finding any goods, articles or money",</p></blockquote>
and so on. We are dealing with found property. The definition of treasure trove is
	<br><blockquote><p>"Treasure discovered hidden in the ground the ownership of which cannot be traced."</p></blockquote>
It seems quite clear that the Bill applies to treasure trove, and this is a serious matter. I hope that the Under-Secretary will be able to give us some guidance on the matter, because there does not seem to be any exception in the case of treasure trove in the 1892 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Dr. J. Dickson Mabon)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that the Crown always takes steps through the procurator fiscal in the matter of unclaimed property, and this would be the case with treasure trove. It is the intention of the Government to persist in this policy since, by Statute, they are permitted to do so, and since the Bill does not infringe that right or confuse or obscure the Crown's right in that regard. I give that assurance absolutely, in case there is a continuing doubt in the Committee's mind that, somehow, the law regarding treasure trove is being obscured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are indebted to my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) for taking the Bill through its many stages. We also thank all those hon. Members on both sides who have sponsored it so well. I hope that the sponsors will continue to dispatch the Bill through its future stages with the same speed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will answer briefly the few points which have been made. I appreciate the remarks made by the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) in welcoming the Bill and in congratulating me on what I have
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
done up to now. He asked what was the procedure in county council areas—in other words, the landward areas of the counties. As I have indicated, at present there is no statutory power for a county council to dispose of lost property, and no general method is adopted. In some areas the property is simply left unclaimed for years. There is no power to sell it, even after six months. In other areas what little is untraced is applied to the police fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member also asked about the second comma in line 14. I thought that it was a misprint, but I am advised that the comma is all right, and corresponds to the comma after "subsection" in line 13.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also thank the hon. Member for Renfrew, East (Miss Harvie Anderson) and the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) for what they have said about the Bill. The hon. Member for Renfrew, East indicated that it might be the case that not enough advertising of lost property took place, while the hon. Member for Dumfries reacted by saying that we should not spend too much money from the police fund on advertising. The provision is there for the chief constable to use the method of advertising in cases where articles are found. I think that the matter is best left to the discretion of the police authorities. The Clause is simple enough, and I think that we should leave it to the police authorities to do the best they can to find the owners of property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to prolong the proceedings of the Committee, but I am sure that the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire will explain the purpose of the Clause, about which I have only one question to ask him, and that concerns the words at the end of subsection (1):
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0329">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"such period as the chief constable or other officer thinks fit."</p></blockquote>
Would he explain how, in his opinion, that will work? Presumably it will be based on the practice at present within the burghs. If, say, a parcel, or something completely wrapped, so that the contents are invisible, comes to their notice, and it appears that the contents are decomposing food, or something like that, presumably the period would have to be a very short one. What discretion does the hon. Member visualise the police will have in this operation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) for his remarks, because I did indeed want to say something about the Clause, because here we are altering the law applying to burghs as well as county areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause deals entirely with perishable articles. Thus the six months' provision does not apply here. The Clause arises out of a defect in Section 412 in relation to perishable goods. It has been welcomed by the county councils, and burghs, through the Convention of Royal Burghs. Subsection (1) gives the police power to dispose of unclaimed perishable articles quickly. I am sure that hon. Members can imagine circumstances in which this might be necessary—for example, a box of fish falling from a vehicle; by the time the lorry is, say, 100 miles away the box of fish, left in a burgh or landward area, is in the possession of the police, who at present have no power to deal with it; they must either throw it away or dispose of it in some other way. The Clause gives them power to deal with matters of this sort and, as I say, it will apply in both burghs and counties since this eventuality is not covered in the Burgh Police Act. The police will, therefore, be able to decide, in the light of the nature of the articles found, what period should elapse before they are sold. Obviously we are not able to lay down any such period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) requires that the proceeds of any such sale should be treated as money found and deposited with the police. They will thus be held—that is, the money—for six months before being disposed of finally. This is a great step forward in relation to perishable lost property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One very small point. I notice that the Clause says "the chief constable or other officer". If the box of fish fell off the lorry it could hardly be a matter in which the chief constable would direct what should happen. "Other officer" presumably includes an ordinary constable. Would he have power to do it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I appreciate the point the hon. Gentleman raises, and I am sure that after this little Bill has become an Act it will be welcomed by the chief constables, who will, no doubt, send out a little note to all their sergeants in the various little places saying that if this sort of thing should happen in their areas they have power to dispose of these articles promptly, before they perish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
