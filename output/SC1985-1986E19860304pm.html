	<p>That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was asking the Minister whether MIBOC would have to seek approval from the Minister for changing the rules as it did when it sought approval originally as a designated agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whatever the rules finally are, we have a duty to ensure that the present uncertainty with regard to commissions and disclosure is fully resolved. MIBOC's proposals so far, especially the Registry of Life Assurance Commissions formula, represent an unfair basis on which to deal with the problem which will inevitably cause inequality between those dealing in the market. We cannot allow that inequality to continue, and I hope that MIBOC's revised proposals will deal with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse that point. The suggestion is that agents acting on behalf of firms and organisations who are signatories of the ROLAC agreement should only be obliged to state that they are in receipt of commission on a fixed scale. They need only say that it is possible for an investor to write off to an office somewhere to get a note of the scale of commissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not good enough. The investor should have available to him, immediately, as of right, a note of what the commissions are. That would be fair to the investor and to agents acting on behalf of themselves or of firms who are not signatories of ROLAC. as they are otherwise liable to be squeezed on to the margins of this business and possibly into extinction. That is a possible injustice and an unsatisfactory aspect of the proposed arrangements, which I hope that the Minister will be prepared to reconsider and to ask MIBOC to reconsider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Michael Howard)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In answer to the point made by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours), the designated agency's rules must continue to comply with the principles in schedule 6. The Secretary of State will have the right to be informed of any change in rules by the designated agency. He may also revoke any powers that he may have previously transferred to the designated agency if he considers that it no longer complies with the relevant
	<span class='label label-info column'>464</span>
criteria in the Bill. His absolute safeguard is that if he does not like the way in which the agency exercises the powers he has transferred to it, he can revoke them. In company with the governor of the Bank of England he has the power to appoint and dismiss the members of the designated agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that combination of powers, the Secretary of State is in a more than sufficiently strong position to ensure that the designated agency continues to comply with the criteria with which it has to comply in order to have powers transferred to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to clarify exactly what that means. Let us say that MIBOC or SIB produces a rule that covers a wide range of matters and subsequently decides to remove that rule because of pressure. Is the Minister saying that the only way that he can deal with that problem is by using the nuclear deterrent of wiping it out and starting again? Has he no power to intervene under the rules made at the time of designation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If no power is being retained surely that is an irresponsible way to proceed. It means that the fine tuning necessary to secure the right regulatory arrangements will not fall within the ambit of the Minister's responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. The Secretary of State will not be able to fine-tune the mechanism, nor is it our intention that he should do so. That is not in the framework provided by the Bill. The Secretary of State is not intended to fine-tune the conduct of business rules. He transfers his powers to a designated agency if he is satisfied that the designated agency can do its job properly and that its rules comply with the principles set out in schedule 6. If the designated agency ceases to comply with those principles, the Secretary of State may revoke the transfer of powers. It is important to note that he may revoke the transfer in part: he is not obliged to revoke it altogether. He can specify areas in relation to which the transfer of powers would not extend and he has the power, together with the Governor of the Bank of England, to dismiss the members of the designated agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister appreciate that my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) has raised an important point? The rules have the force of law. It is the power to make rules and then to amend them that sits so oddly on a voluntary body. That is the basis of my hon. Friend's anxiety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not use the word "odd" although I accept that the power is unusual or even novel. We claim credit for innovative thinking in drafting the legislation which we maintain is required for the problems with which we propose to deal. We believe that it is a commendable way to deal with the problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the points raised by my hon. Friends, which we canvassed at great length last week. I have asked MIBOC to look at some aspects that gave rise to the greatest anxiety during our last sitting and it has undertaken to bring forward the results of its thinking by Report. I do not accept the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) that the ROLAC system is unfair. I did
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0266">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>465</span>
not entirely follow what he said about independent intermediaries who might not be members of ROLAC. They would comply with a scale of commissions, but if they did not wish to to that—they are not obliged to—and are remunerated on a different basis, they must disclose their commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the mischief that we are attempting to deal with is that of the differential incentive, which gives the independent intermediary an incentive to press on his client one kind of policy rather than another, the ROLAC scale and system are effective in dealing with that differential incentive. I said last week that we need to find a method of dealing with differential incentives for tied agents that will introduce some comparability or eqivalence into the market. I do not want my hon. Friend to be under the illusion that I am prepared to agree with him that the ROLAC scale is unfair and an unsatisfactory basis on which to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend has misunderstood my point. I am not complaining about the existence of a ROLAC scale; I see some merits in it. But I am complaining about the differential requirement on disclosure. If the independent intermediary who is not a signatory of ROLAC is alone obliged immediately to disclose his commission, the investor may be unduly impressed by the fact that the commission charged is highlighted, which will be to the disadvantage of the independent intermediary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that point. MIBOC is examining it and we canvassed it at considerable length last week. It is difficult to oblige tied agents to disclose their commission to show a differential incentive because that is not likely to do the job. If anything, it will make the commission appear so low that it will disadvantage the independent intermediary. I hope that there are other ways of dealing with the matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) showed the way forward last week, and I know that MIBOC will look with interest at his proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCrindle 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. and learned Friend make it clear that during last Thursday's sitting we did not discuss whether what has become known as the soft disclosure should remain the basis for commission declarations of independent intermediaries, nor has the Minister asked MIBOC to examine the question? On the basis of our debates, the Minister asked MIBOC whether a comparable system in parallel could or should be created for tied agents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather disturbed by my hon. and learned Friend's response to my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle). I thought that we agreed that MIBOC should study the whole question of disclosure, including elements such as management charges, and commissions. I do not share the attachment of some hon. Members to the ROLAC formula, which is a cosy fudge by the industry to obscure from the public the amount of commissions received. The industry fears that if the public know they will not buy insurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that hard disclosure would be misleading, and to that extent we are at one. But if there is not to
	<span class='label label-info column'>466</span>
be hard disclosure, there must be a system of disclosure dealing with all aspects of insurance. Simply to study the alternative application to tied agents would be totally unsatisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I am required to repeat my answers endlessly we shall never leave clause 45. I have told my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) more than once that I have also asked MIBOC to study whether it is possible to require the disclosure of the amount of money given in premiums that is devoted to investments rather than to expenses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The attempt to try to identify a way of requiring the disclosure of differential incentives for tied agents, to bring them more nearly into a relationship of equivalence with independent intermediaries, is a different matter. I have endlessly endeavoured to explain that there are two separate issues. They should be treated separately, and that is what I have asked MIBOC to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. and learned Friend the Under-Secretary believe that consideration should be given to a requirement that in the exercise of his powers, the Secretary of State should not act in a way that would give any trading advantage to any particular authorised person? I am sure that my hon. and learned Friend will say, "Of course the Secretary of State would not act in such a way." Does my hon. and learned Friend think that there could be some advantage in enshrining that principle in statute?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. it would be unnecessary and undesirable to incorporate such an example in the Bill. If it were included, other issues for inclusion would immediately be raised, and. therefore, I do not invite the Committee to accept the precedent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>

	<div class='title'>INDEMNITY RULES</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 40. in page 32, line 32, leave out subsection (2) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) Rules under this section may require recognised self-regulatory organisations and recognised professional bodies and their members who are authorised persons for the purposes of investment business to participate in any scheme for indemnity established under those rules, irrespective of any additional indemnity scheme which the organisations and bodies may themselves operate."'.</p></blockquote>
This amendment takes us to one of the most important aspects of any regulatory system—the provision of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0267">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>467</span>
proper arrangements for compensation for those who may lose if matters go wrong. One of the weaknesses of Lloyd's, for example, has been the absence of proper compensatory arrangements. We have seen that clearly demonstrated in the notorious case of the PCW syndicate, where Lloyd's has striven hard to avoid what, in any ordinary lest, would be an obvious obligation. I suspect that that arises directly from the fact that Lloyd's has never seen fit to introduce adequate compensatory arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 49 provides for such arrangements, but my amendment would go further than that. I would allow the Secretary of State, or the designated agency, to set up a compensation scheme, and then require, in appropriate cases. SROs and other bodies to belong to the scheme, irrespective of any additional arrangements that they wish to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is important, because there will be grave doubts whether many of the bodies operating under the Bill, when it is enacted, will have the resources of ability to run an adequate compensation scheme. Recognised professional bodies may be all right, presumably because the scale of their business will be relatively small, and they are usually well-established bodies with compensation arrangements, which may or may not be adequate for their general purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be worth reporting to the Committee my conversation with one of the professional bodies, which one would expect to seek recognition under the Bill. However, I was firmly assured that it would not be seeking recognition, and that few professional bodies may do so. In that case, the Securities and Investments Board may have to handle many applications for direct authorisation. The Minister may yet regret his rejection of our amendment, which would have empowered SIB to direct people to join the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must also be grave doubts about self-regulating organisations. Admittedly, the stock exchange is in a special position, as on many other issues. It has the experience and resources—at least until this point—to run a reasonably effective compensation scheme. But it is difficult to see how those self-regulating organisations that have yet to be brought into existence, or have only a recent history, will raise the money to provide an adequate fund for such a scheme, and how they will obtain adequate insurance cover, if that is the route that they choose to take.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman clarify where he is taking the Committee? Is he suggesting that, if the amendment were carried, and SIB or SROs required the introduction of professional indemnity insurance, any professional indemnity cover already held by the member organisation of SIB. SROs. would no longer be necessary? In other words, is he suggesting that we should have a single or double banking of indemnity? In view of the limited capacity that, as he may be aware, exists in that field, he should be careful that we do not introduce something that cannot be achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the hon. Gentleman's intervention supports the point that I am trying to make. I fear that many individual SROs—particularly those that have yet to become fully operational—are simply not in a position suddenly to emerge overnight with a
	<span class='label label-info column'>468</span>
fully-fledged compensation scheme. They will not have the resources and they will not be able to get cover on acceptable grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there are SROs that have difficulty in establishing an adequate indemnity arrangement for their own members, the amendment would give the SIB the power to require them to join the scheme that it intends to set up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or carry their own?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be an option for them. There is nothing mandatory here; all that is being suggested is that the SIB should have the chance to take that power if it decided that it was appropriate—no doubt after consultation with the SRO—that the cover could be provided by such means. If there were an existing scheme that went beyond the cover provided by this scheme, or if SROs subsequently decided that they wanted to top it up in some way, there would be no objection to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me—and to SIB itself—that this is the only way we can be confident that from the moment when the SROs take up their responsibilities, there will be in each case a fully operational and effective indemnity arrangement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for again interrupting the hon. Gentleman's speech, but there are some details that are inescapable when arguing an amendment such as this one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) will be aware that the indemnity required of. for example, a large firm of pensions consultants may run to many millions of pounds, whereas the indemnity required of a small firm of life assurance brokers in. for example. Dagenham would be comparatively small. Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that in addition to all the SIB's other responsibilities, it should be required to set the level of indemnity for each individual member who has registered with the SIB or with an SRO?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The SIB proposes to put in place a compensation scheme which, as I recall, provides a maximum of £30.000 on each claim and there will be many instances where the indemnity will have to cover a much greater potential loss than that. That would be unaffected. But equally, there will be cases where an SRO that has only just got off the ground may find it difficult to put in place a scheme that provides even that minimal cover. The SIB would welcome an amendment to provide an administratively simple way of guaranteeing that basic cover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth pointing out that although the SIB recognises the special case of the stock exchange, it is inclined to say that in rapidly changing market conditions, with the breakdown between broking and jobbing and the greater difficulty of securing insurance cover in many cases, even the stock exchange may not find it as easy as it has been to maintain the compensation arrangements that it has operated successfully up to now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) is right to draw attention to the points that he has raised, because of the consequences that may flow from the establishing of a central fund. SROs may wish, or may be required, to come into such a central fund initially, and as they become stronger and more
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0268">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>469</span>
established they may find it easier to set up indemnity arrangements on their own initiative and under their own control. One would have to take care that the withdrawal of key SROs did not leave behind it a central fund that was gravely weakened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not be too deterred by that prospect, or by the need to face that problem, since there are many other spheres—banking, for example—where there is a straightforward requirement to join a central fund as a condition of being able to operate at all. I do not believe that we should cavil or demur too strongly if it were suggested that that should apply to this sphere, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Equally, the hon. Gentleman will remember that insurance brokers are under one of the few SROs at present in existence—the Insurance Brokers Registration Council. The 1975 Act requires a person to have professional indemnity before he can be registered as a broker, but it is left to the individual applicant to arrange it. Although there may be attractions in the centralist argument that the hon. Gentleman deploys, there may equally be arguments in favour of leaving it to the individual participant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the Insurance Brokers Registration Council is to become an SRO. That is one of the untidy elements in the structure that yet have to be resolved. Nevertheless, the hon. Gentleman could equally accept that ISRO. or perhaps even NASDIM. which has been in existence for some time now and which is perhaps further developed than most, may recognise the merits of accepting the central role that SIB could play. Perhaps the hon. Member for Beacons-field (Mr. Smith) could enlighten us on that point by intervening later in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is yet another issue in which we must examine how seriously the Government are approaching the problem of regulation. In banking there is no problem. There is simply a requirement that banks and licensed deposit takers, and so on. should be part of the deposit protection fund. There is no question of their being able to opt in or to opt out: that is the condition on which they operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are saying that they have fundamental and deeply rooted objections to a much less mandatory system, or even the possibility of a system being introduced, we are entitled to ask whether that calls into question the seriousness of the Government's purpose in approaching the regulation of the City. Will the new regime be so much lighter and less effective than that required for banks?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall listen carefully to the Minister's reply as we regard this as another touchstone showing the Government's seriousness of purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, in case I have not already made it clear, although I tabled the amendment without the benefit of SIB's drafting advice. I understand that SIB welcomes and supports the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) was a trifle disingenuous in the early part of his speech when, in reply to an intervention, he said that there was nothing mandatory about the amendment. I would not normally level such a charge against him. but it is justified on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>470</span>
The amendment would give SIB the power to make it mandatory for SROs to join the SIB compensation scheme. The Bill requires every SRO to make protection arrangements equivalent to those provided by SIB itself, but SROs would not be obliged to join the SIB scheme. They could make their own arrangements for protection as long as they complied with the equivalence requirement. So the stock exchange, for example, could confidently be expected to rely on its considerable record of providing adequate protection and continue to do that in its own way and according to its own rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If some of the other SROs encounter problems to which the hon. Gentleman referred, there would be nothing to stop them joining the SIB scheme. If they find that that is the best way of providing the equivalence that the Bill requires, that course will be open to them, but it would be unnecessary to give SIB a power to make it mandatory for all SROs. including the stock exchange, to provide protection for investors by joining a compensation scheme set up by SIB. I cannot begin to see how that can be regarded as a touchstone of the seriousness with which the new regime is to provide an effective, regulatory framework and for that reason I invite the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister will accept that the amendment would not. in itself, make an SIB scheme mandatory for SROs. It would leave the SIB with the power to make rules on such requirements. The amendment is not mandatory: it uses the words "may require". The Bill sets out many of the rulemaking powers in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the SIB should decide that such scheme were required for the proper regulation of the conduct of investment business, the amendment would give it the power to insist on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If. as the Minister suggested. SROs could wake up one day and decide that they were fed up with the fag of having to run the compensation scheme, that the premiums they had to pay were too high, and that it was an administrative burden, so they would opt into the SIB scheme for the time being, but might opt out if things were to improve or they were to take on extra staff, a compensation scheme run centrally by the SIB—which I think the Minister wants—would not be creditable or satisfactory. A scheme with the constant possibility of opting in and opting out could not work effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is a touchstone, because it raises the question of the relationship between the SIB and the SROs. Which is to prevail? Is there or is there not to be a proper system of regulation? If it is to be a matter of little informal agreements reached here and there. on this or that point, between one voluntary body and a series of other voluntary bodies, it will not be a proper or effective system of regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is yet another touchstone of the Government's seriousness, because, if they want effective regulation, and if they concede—as I think the Minister would—that a proper compensation scheme is an important element in such regulation, they must give the SIB the power that it has asked for and that it thinks is essential, if it is to carry out its regulatory function.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman a document in which the SIB says that such a power is essential, if it is to carry out its regulatory role?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a document here—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Essential?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is entitled to pick me up on the use of that word. If I were to look through this substantial brief that the SIB has provided—if I were able to read that quickly—I may not be able to find the word "essential".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the document states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The SIB strongly support this amendment … While … Professional Bodies may be able to make adequate arrangements … it will be very difficult … to place reliance on any scheme for compensation devised by an SRO."</p></blockquote>
Committee Members may not have seen the document themselves, but they will readily grasp the flavour of the advice from the SIB. The Minister has extracted from me a concession that it may not use the word "essential", but that does not reduce the force of the SIB*s advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other fields no such objections as the Minister has made to a central compensation fund have been raised. In areas such as banking, proper regulation is thought to demand a properly run. centrally administered compensation scheme—it is thought to be axiomatic. As the Minister bridles so readily at the suggestion that it might also feature in the regulation under the Bill, we must conclude that the Government are not serious about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have the clearest advice from the SIB. I have not read the whole of its brief, so I cannot deny that it may not say "essential". However, it is clear that the one body that the Government have chosen to carry out a regulatory function says that it would be difficult without the power in the amendment, which it strongly supports. But if the Minister adheres to the view that it is not imporant, a question mark must again be raised over how that system of regulation will work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, in his reply, made one fresh point. If SROs choose to join the central SIB compensation scheme, it is important that there should be safeguards against their precipitate withdrawal. We take the view that the rules which could be made under clause 49 could be made by SIB to prevent such precipitate withdrawal. If SIB is worried that the rules are not sufficient, it may be necessary to bring forward an amendment on Report to deal with that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of generality. SIB has the task of deciding whether an SRO's compensation fund is adequate. If SIB does not think it adequate, it need not recognise the SRO. But if the fund is adequate, there is no reason to give SIB the mandatory power to require an SRO to make its compensation arrangements through a central scheme. It is irrelevant that other systems, which do not have the features of this system, make different arrangements. I hope that the Committee will reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his last point. He had moved some way. and has recognised at least part of SIB's fears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>472</span>
The Minister challenged me to find the word "essential" in the SIB briefing, but I must confess that I have been unable to find it. However, I have found that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The SIB believe that a soundly-based scheme can be divised only on the basis of statutory powers such as those given by Clause 49".</p></blockquote>
That sentence contains a fair implication of the degree of essentiality. After recalling that it was the failure of the New York stock exchange compensation scheme that prompted the formation of the SIPC. SIB concludes
	<br><blockquote><p>"We must not let history repeat itself."</p></blockquote>
SIB appears to feel strongly about the matter. It may not be the language of essentiality: nevertheless, it is pretty clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members welcome the Minister's undertaking and we look forward to what he will produce on Report. However, we feel that it is such an important aspect of the relationship between SIB and the SROs— it is the fulcrum on which the effectiveness of the scheme will turn—that unless we get some sort of concession, the scheme will be gravely weakened. Although we welcome the Minister's comments, we shall press the matter to a vote to register our strong feelings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 148. in page 33. line 6. after "be", insert "or may be".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take the following amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='procedure'>

	<p>No. 149 in page 33, line 7. leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"the right to it is to be excluded or modified"</p></blockquote></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>
	<i>"{aa)</i> provide for the payment of interest on the amount of any claim in respect of which indemnity is to be available.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: These three amendments were suggested by SIB. The object of the first two is to make it possible for the Secretary of State, or the designated agency, to establish a discretionary compensation fund— "discretionary" being the key word. The object of amendment No. 150 is to enable the fund to 	<br><blockquote><p>"provide for the payment of interest"</p></blockquote>
to investors as well as capital sums owing by a firm that defaults.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is an element of discretion in a compensation scheme it would be possible to deal with foreign firms. Those might prove expensive to the scheme and SIB might decide to exclude them. Amendments Nos. 148 and 149 would also allow the compensation funds to pay more than the maximum proposed level of compensation of £30,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0270">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>473</span>
Amendment No. 150 is straightforward; equity suggests that interest on capital should be paid to someone who has been robbed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's first two amendments would give the Secretary of State or designated agency an explicit power to run a compensation scheme with a considerable discretionary element in it. They would enable the scheme rules to say that indemnity will be available in some circumstances and may be available in other circumstances. I have no difficulty with this concept if the intention is that the scheme rules should lay down basic compensation entitlements which could not be set aside, but should also enable but not require the scheme to pay additional compensation, perhaps on an ex-gratia basis, if finances permit and, in the circumstances, it is thought appropriate to do so. Provided that the basic entitlements make adequate provision for investors, especially private investors, this approach seems to me to be sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 8 of schedule 6 requires rules made under the clause to make the best provision that can reasonably be made under the clause and the Secretary of State will have to satisfy himself that this principle is met before rule-making powers under the clause may be transferred. In doing so, he would want to look particularly closely at the basic entitlements. Subject to his being satisfied by them, I would see no objection to, and some advantages in, this approach, for the reasons that my hon Friend has given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the intention is that the rules should make all or most payments discretionary, I should be much more concerned and I do not see how the Secretary of State could satisfy himself that the best provision which could reasonably be made would be made, because of the very large discretionary element.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall consider further whether the Bill as drafted would enable rules to be drawn up which would permit a discretionary scheme on the lines of my first example, but not on the lines of my second.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that my hon. Friend's third amendment is necessary. The powers in subsection (1) to
	<br><blockquote><p>"make rules concerning indemnity against any claim"</p></blockquote>
and in subsection (2) to make rules specifying the extent to which indemnity is to be available are wide enough to allow the rules to require payment of interest on claims.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend's reply is very helpful. I am clear about SIB's objective, which is along the lines of the first example he gave. Since he has undertaken to look at the problem and see whether the result can be achieved without making all payments discretionary—which I accept would be undesirable—I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>CLIENTS' MONEY</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>5.15 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 170, in page 34, line 17, after "money", insert "and interest thereon"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals with clients' money and subsection (2) gives details of the regulations covering such money. Subsection 
	<i>(2)(d)</i> states that regulations may
	<br><blockquote><p>"require the keeping of accounts and records in respect of clients' money".</p></blockquote>
That is fundamental. However, I am advised that interest on clients' money is not clients' money and an accountant should report on compliance with regulations on interest. Therefore, the amendment is designed to make it clear that records should be kept of clients' money plus any interest accrued on that money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment relates also to subsection (2)
	<i>(f)</i> which provides that the regulations may authorise the retention of interest on clients' money. I was sorry to see that provision. I hope that if the retention of any part of interest is to be authorised, it will be on a de minimis basis similar to that which exists under the Estate Agents Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). It is important that regulations made under the clause can require the keeping and auditing of accounts covering not only clients' money but interest on that money. I shall not debate whether the term "clients' money" includes interest, because the regulations on accounts and audit will cover interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) is only illustrative. It provides that regulations "may in particular" cover the matters listed. These matters are expected to form the main content of the regulations, but the regulations may also cover any other matter, provided that it stays within the vires set out in subsection (1). I assure my hon. Friend that requiring accounts to be kept for interest as well as for clients' money would be within those vires. I hope that he is satisfied with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be possible, if it were appropriate, to limit the power to a de minimis basis, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister said about the list under subsection (2) differed from what he said about the areas specified under clause 45(2). We were told that under that provision the list was designed to resolve problems at the outskirts of the general power, whereas in this case we are told that these areas are only illustrative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the same thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that it is the same thing— far from it. In either case, the point made by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) is important. If the list is only illustrative, there is little harm in clarifying what could be a contentious point. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield has done the Committee a service by tabling the amendment and there is no reason for the Minister not to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0271">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the list is only illustrative, the point could be argued either way. As I said on clause 45, why bother with a list at all, if it is only illustrative? We might as well get shot of the whole subsection. However, if it illustrates the main matters to be dealt with by regulations, and if the question of interest is unclear, why not include interest in the subsection, even if it does not need to be mentioned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I did not give my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Howard) the impression that this matter is unclear. It is not. Interest could be payable under the clause as it now stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that as the list is illustrative, regulations could deal with any matter not referred to in the list, as long as it came within the ambit of subsection (1). It would be absurd to make a big issue of such a small matter. However, I am sorry that my hon. and learned Friend is unable to accede to what seemed to be a modest request. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fortified by the result of the Division, I propose amendment No. 171 with some confidence. There is confusion in subsection 
	<i>(2)(e)</i> about the role of an auditor and the role of a reporting accountant. There is no provision in the Bill requiring an authorised investment business to have an audit, although any authorised investment business which is a limited liability company is required under company law to have such an audit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, paragraph 
	<i>(e)</i> deals not so much with the requirement for an audit, as compliance with regulations. For example, under the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977—and I am sure that my hon. and learned Friend will be aware of this—there are two different requirements. There has to be an audit as well as a report by a reporting accountant showing whether the firm in question complies with the regulations made under the Act. The same is true of the Estate Agents Act 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>476</span>
There is no reason why the auditor and the reporting accountant should not be the same person. If that was intended in paragraph 
	<i>(e),</i> reference should have been made to "the" auditor rather than to "an" auditor in paragraph 
	<i>(e)</i> to make the intention clear. However, I do not think that that was the intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is confusion over those two matters, both of which are important to the conduct of a business. A firm might carry out other business which is not governed by the Bill because it is not investment business. The purpose of my amendments is to clarify that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Cash 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stafford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to who is or is not an accountant, there is sometimes a misconception about whether only those persons belonging to chartered bodies are accountants. I speak wearing the hat of legal adviser to the Society of Company and Commercial Accountants. There is a serious problem affecting people who are not members of chartered bodies. They are often small businesses which advise other small businesses and a degree of expertise is required. We discussed the same issue in relation to insurance brokers so it is central to the Bill and to what is right and fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Accountants who are not members of chartered bodies should be given the same opportunities to provide advice to clients who wish to use their services as members of chartered bodies. That is not a criticism of the chartered bodies, but quite the opposite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the first three points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). The first two concern terminology. I accept that it might be more accurate to regard the function to be carried out under subsection (2)(e) of the clause as being more akin to that of a reporting accountant than to that of an auditor. I shall look again at the wording of the subsection. I also agree that nobody can give an absolute assurance that regulations have been complied with and that the duty of an auditor or reporting accountant, should be to give his opinion as to compliance. I shall, therefore, consider incorporating words to this effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not, however, agree with my hon. Friend's proposal to drop the provision specifically enabling the regulations to prescribe the matters to be covered in the report made by the auditor or reporting accountant. This is a standard provision which gives helpful flexibility in determining the details of the contents of the report. My hon. Friend's concern about the potential width of the provision is unfounded. It has to be read in the context of the clause as a whole and, in particular, of the regulation-making vires in subsection (1). It would not be a proper use of the power to seek to require the auditor or reporting accountant to report on matters not relating to clients' money. The power can properly be used only to amplify the requirements on reporting on this particular subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) was, as one would expect, a learned observation, but it does not affect the concessions that I have made to my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Everyone recognises that this form of selling is a stock-in-trade of the insurance industry. Much insurance business is done and many policies are sold in this way. In a consultative document MIBOC said that a great deal of life assurance is not bought but sold. The company makes the approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can understand how and why the practice has developed, but it gives rise to considerable concern. I know that surveys have proved that it has not been abused, but nevertheless if we are concerned about investor protection, we must be concerned about the vulnerability of investors, most of whom have very little experience of making investment decisions. They will be the very antithesis of the professional investors. They will be approached in their own homes where perhaps they feel most comfortable and protected, but where they could most easily be misled as a consequence. They will be approached by people without invitation and caught on the hop.

My root and branch amendment precludes the lawful selling of investments by cold calling although it does not go as far as to make it a criminal offence. It leaves the rest of the clause much as it stands and offers to those who are victims of unauthorised cold calling the remedy of evading any agreement that had been made. We should reflect on the strong view expressed by Professor Gower in his report that a tough approach is required. He recognises, as the British Insurance Association points out, that cold calling could be said to have a benefiical social function. The seame could be true of many forms of selling which involve knocks on people's doors. However, that is hardly sufficient to set against the disadvantages of cold calling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman want to ban all calls at the door?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even the Minister should accept that the Bill does not go so far as to deal with all calls. It deals
	<span class='label label-info column'>478</span>
only with the selling of investment to people in their own homes—there should be no ambiguity over that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whereas Professor Gower accepts in a glancing and marginal way that there may be a social case to be made for regular calls on people's doorsteps, he believes that cold calling is so pernicious that it should be banned altogether. That is also the strong view of the consumer associations and the National Consumer Council which have mounted a substantial campaign against cold calling over a long period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professor Gower would not only have banned cold calling under a provision such as clause 51, but he would have made it a criminal offence. My amendment would not go as far as that. It would remove the issue from the criminal law and offer a remedy of avoiding the agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professor Gower also felt that if the Government, against his advice, wished to allow cold calling in certain circumstances, we should have to consider carefully the conditions on which that was permitted. So far, unfortunately, we have no idea about those conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The conditions that have been touted so far fall into two main groups. One is that cold calling should be limited to particular groups of people—especially to the sort of professional or business investors the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) spoke about this morning. There may be something to be said for permitting cold calling in those carefully defined areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, although Professor Gower says that the mere fact that cold calling is being done on members of the Athenaeum club, solicitors or whatever is beside the point. Those people may be just as vulnerable, naive and as easily exploited as others. Professor Gower's advice is that we would have to define that exception carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Consumer Council would probably accept the other way of allowing that to occur within permissible limits—that cold calling should be permitted in conjunction with a cooling off period. That may be the best compromise, and perhaps the Minister expects the rules to state that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, according to Professor Gower, those two issues are not related, and cooling off in respect of cold calling is no more significant than in respect of other forms of selling investment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I understand that, although Professor Gower does not accept it, the hon. Gentleman may be willing to accept cold calling with an adequate cooling-off period provision? What does he regard as an adequate period? I am anxious that the standard 10-day period is insufficient, if we take into account the time taken to obtain advice and delays in the post, for example. We could double that to three weeks. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will give us his views on that suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right to say that, in my view, we may find an acceptable compromise through the cooling-off period. 1 was simply making the point that Professor Gower is not convinced that that is the solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not draft rules on my feet in Committee, but I agree with the hon. Gentleman that 10 days is probably too short. People tend to put aside such matters until
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0273">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>479</span>
they have a spare moment during the weekend to deal with them, so the 10 days may pass quickly. Three weeks, or thereabouts, however, gives sufficient time to obtain proper advice, and consider the matter further, and is about the right length of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I remain sceptical about cold calling, and the amendment goes to the root and branch of the practice, I hope that the Minister will say that the rules proposed under the clause will adequately meet the anxieties of many Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The way in which the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) has proposed the amendment marks a new stage in the influence wielded by Professor Gower over the Committee proceedings. The hon. Gentleman has often sought to reinforce his arguments by relying on Professor Gower's authority, but, on this occasion, he has been self-effacing. He would be content with something much less fundamental than is contained in the amendment—he would be prepared, for example, to accept cold calling, governed by specific rules for the cooling off period. However, as Professor Gower believed that that was insufficient, he had tabled the amendment and was acting as the learned professor's spokesman in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister arrived on the scene comparatively late in these matters, but I had always understood that he and his Department were similarly influenced by Professor Gower. As I recall it, did not a predecessor of the Secretary of State ask Professor Gower to report on those matters and did not his report lead to the Bill? Is the Minister telling us that this wonderful structure has emerged pristine pure from his fertile mind, unaffected by Professor Gower?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am the first to recognise the considerable debt that we owe to Professor Gower, and the great influence wielded by him. But I have not said that, although I may disagree with a clause, it has been included at his wish. That is what the hon. Gentleman is saying in respect of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman recognises that with provision for a cooling-off period and possibly with rules limiting cold calling to specific kinds of investors, cold calling would be an acceptable practice. That is enshrined in clause 51. The difference between us is simple, and not susceptible to extensive argument. It is unnecessary to ban the practice root and branch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 51 is not restricted to cold calling on homes, but deals with the generality of cold calling. The effect of amendment No. 41 would be to ban it altogether, even between professionals and even when governed by rules that stipulated a cooling-off period; That would be going too far, as I think that the hon. Member for Dagenham would agree. Therefore, I invite the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's reply was entertaining rather than informative, but he is right that we do not disagree over anything very serious. The difficulty— with which the Committee will be familiar—is that we do not know under what conditions cold calling will be permitted. Therefore, I shall not press the amendment, but I hope that by Report there will be draft rules on the matter. It would be helpful if the Minister could suggest that that might be the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>480</span>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is slowly but surely moving closer to my position, because I hope that that will be the case, and believe that it might. If so, we can return to the matter on Report, when we shall have more information. On that understanding, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like every other member of the Committee, I am aware of the way in which unsolicited calls have been misused. Rules to control the method and incidence of such calls are overdue. However, before we continue with universal condemnation of unsolicited calls, I remind the Committee that many highly respectable companies started by using the telephone directory, because they had no other way of setting up in business, although that is no reason for unsolicited calls to become the order of the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amid moans from Opposition Members, I wish to say that I know many people who have bought life assurance—sometimes against their better judgment— and have then died suddenly, leaving their next of kin to benefit from the actions of a salesman whose initial approach to the client was uninvited.

I recall that we had a debate on a similar amendment on clause 5. I shall not repeat the arguments that I advanced, unsuccessfully, then, and the Minister may take a similar view of this amendment.

The problem is that neither the amendment that was then under discussion nor the present one actually seems to achieve the result which I understand the Law

Society of Scotland and the hon. Member are seeking. Is the intention that a person who transfers property under an investment agreement entered into following a contravention of the relevant provision should be able to recover not only that property but also any rights attaching to it which would have come to him if he had retained that property such as dividends or a rights issue? If so, I can say that the clause is intended to provide that the benefit of such rights should be repaid to the person seeking to unwind the contract. All fruits of the property should be restored. I shall consider further whether the clause as drafted meets this point and, if necessary, will bring an amendment forward later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 141 in page 38, line 32, leave out 'and' and insert 'or'
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a tidying up amendment which corrects a drafting error.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exceptions from the restrictions on investment advertising for exempt persons contained in clause 53(l)(b) are intended to be available to a person who is exempted under any of the four provisions mentioned; to qualify for the exception, a person does not have to be exempted under all the clauses listed. Accordingly, it is necessary to substitute "or" for the word "and" as shown in the amendment. I should perhaps remind the Committee that the exceptions from the restrictions on advertising will apply only to advertisements relating to matters in respect of which the person is exempted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 130 in page 39, line 30, leave out paragraph (c).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to remove the possibility that the Secretary of State could exempt from the requirments of clause 53 advertisements that appear to him to be addressed to those sufficiently expert to understand the risks involved. It is a dangerous provision, as it is extraordinarily difficult to ensure that advertisements stay only with those to whom they are directed. They have a habit of passing around, even if they care carefully addressed. Advertisements can appear in the specialist press or be sent by direct mail shots, but it is still difficult to ensure that they do not pass into other hands. We have therefore to approach these exceptions with great caution. The Minister will be pleased to hear that Professor Gower and I are of the same mind here. In paragraph 3.11 of part II of his
	<span class='label label-info column'>482</span>
report, Professor Gower expresses his unhappiness at the exception and says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Observance of 'suitability' and 'know your customer' rules of good market practice are, as the American experience confirms, difficult to police since they depend on subjective judgments."</p></blockquote>
In that passage Professor Gower again identifies the possible difficulties of distinguishing between those who are and those who are not sufficiently expert.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision enables the Secretary of State to make his own judgment, and therefore it is not the subjective judgment of the advertiser but the more or less objective judgement of the Secretary of State that will apply. However, the Secretary of State cannot be sure whom the advertisements will reach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is running counter to Professor Gower's opinion and running a grave risk by opening up such an exception. I hope that he will reconsider the inclusion of paragraph 
	<i>(c)</i> in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) recognised that what is between us is the route that should be taken to achieve our similar objects. It is better to deal with the worries that lie behind the amendment with an order than to restrict the scope of an order in a way that is not only unnecessary, but damaging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 53(3)(c) does not break new ground. There are already legal provisions that have a similar effect. Section 79(2) of the Companies Act 1985, as extended by regulation 7(2) of the Stock Exchange (Listing) Regulations 1984, deems an offer to professional investors not to be an offer to the public and, therefore, not to require a prospectus. Section 14(5) of the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act 1985 enables professional investors to be sent documents that cannot be issued to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill severely restricts advertising by unauthorised firms. They can publish nothing but listing particulars or a full prospectus. Anything less must either be vetted by the stock exchange, under clause 126, or be confined to the matters allowed by clause 53(2). Those restrictions are appropriate for offers made to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently there have been many innovations in the capital markets, from Eurobonds to the instruments that are labelled "commercial paper" or "securitised debt". Those innovations are valuable not only because they give industry and commerce a wider choice of funding, but because they bring employment and invisible earnings to the United Kingdom, as we have been able to offer the world the ingenuity, services, and regulatory climate that it likes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is crucial that that sort of business should continue to develop and thrive here. It will not do so if our regulatory requirements are unduly burdensome. Paragraph 
	<i>(c)</i> and the corresponding provision in clause 140 enable the Secretary of State to exempt offers of those types of instruments from the provisions, if such offers are made only to experts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The instruments that I have described are designed to be tradeable between large financial institutions. They extend traditional banking facilities, and are not new ways of raising capital from the public. The minimum tradeable lot is customarily beyond the reach of most of the public. An issue may be placed and redeemed over as little as seven days. The full prospectus
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1985-1986V004P0I0275">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>483</span>
requirements are unnecessary and would certainly drive business away from London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment on its own, if clause 140 were not altered, would require advertisements for such instruments to be issued by authorised businesses. But most authorised businesses are retailers, who seek no part in that sort of activity and are not qualified to play one. It would not be useful to interpose them, in the way that the amendment implies, between the treasury departments of major companies and major financial institutions. It is better to follow the course set out in the Bill—to provide limited exceptions from the restrictions on advertising by authorised businesses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we approve clause 53, as I hope we shall, will my honourable and learned Friend the Minister assure us on an important matter. The Government frequently issue investment instruments, such as national savings certificates, which they advertise to encourage the public to invest in them. The Government, in advertising national savings certificates, have not always satisfied the most exacting demands of probity, although they have perhaps affected to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can all recollect a familiar poster that appeared for a long time on London underground stations depicting a seemingly benign clergyman encouraging the public to take up the latest issue of national savings certificates. The connotations of that advertisement were that they were the most honest and reliable investment for a member of the general public. At the same time, the Government were systematically inflating, debasing and debauching the currency so that the 10 per cent return—or whatever it was—that was held out to investors was totally illusory. That advertisement was systematically misleading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Committee gives its assent to clause 53, I ask my honourable and learned Friend the Minister to assure us that the Government are resolved that their future standards of advertising to investors will be very much higher than they have been in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to ask my hon. and Learned Friend the Minister for clarification on subsection (2). I am sure that he will have noticed that the market has recently agreed to restrict colour photographs and other promotional material in prospectuses, some of which were beginning to look more like a weekend colour supplement than an offer to subscribe for stocks or shares Would the inclusion of glossy photographs in an advertisement that would otherwise be exempt under subsection (2) contravene both its wording and its spirit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I imagine that my hon. Friend was referring to the previous Labour Cabinet. He must speak for himself; I do not want to talk in those terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have just given up Crown immunity in hospitals, so I do not see why there should be Crown immunity for Government advertising of savings. My hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon is quite right some of the advertisements placed in the past have been scandalously misleading. The Government can influence what happens through their economic policies—they can use inflation to debase the value of people's savings, then offer some illusory interest. In fact, even with the interest, the capital is being eroded year after year. There have been some appalling examples, and I greatly regret that this has been included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worse, because it covers local authorites and the central banks of other countries; it even covers international organisations to which we do not belong. International organisations of which Portugal or Greece may be members will all be able to enjoy exemption.

We do not want to go over the top, but I hope that my hon. and learned Friend the Minister will consider it carefully. If we were to bring in a provision to deal with clause 53(1)(iv), we may have to come forward with a Bill called the "Republican Immunity Bill".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Is it seriously suggested that the stringent terms of the Bill should apply to the Government as well as to all private sector companies?

The clause would enable a disqualification direction to apply to employment by some or all authorised persons or exempt representatives.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments were suggested to me by the stock exchange. There is a danger that the powers provided under clauses 56 and 57 might be applied rather differently to a member of the stock exchange or a similar SRO, than to SROs with less extensive or comprehensive rules. A stock exchange member could be at risk under the provisions if he were in contravention of a rule laid down by the stock exchange, although not necessarily by SIB or the Secretary of State, and certainly not by other SROs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The stock exchange fears that these provisions could open up members to action in an unfair way—beyond the bounds which SIB requires of SROs—and would act also as a disincentive to potential members. That would have unfortunate long-term consequences. People seeking the least rigorous system of regulation might take one of those factors into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to endorse the stock exchange's point by tabling and moving the amendments. I hope that the Minister can assure me—and thus the stock exchange—that either the point is well taken, or that he is prepared to meet it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that my response will fall neatly into either of the two categories identified by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). It is apparently unfair that members of self-regulating organisation such as the stock exchange should be penalised for adopting higher standards than the SIB requires. He is also right to identify the undesirable possibility that that provision might deter an SRO from adopting those higher standards.

However to adopt a double standards regime under which only some rules gave rise to certain remedies would cause considerable difficulties, especially for investor protection. It would be burdensome to expect the investor to appreciate into which category a rule fell. Moreover, there might be grave difficulties of interpretation in assessing whether a rule of an SRO was extra to what was required by the designated agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When this unfairness was initially drawn to my attention I was sympathetic. On further consideration I concluded that to attempt to deal with the problem in the manner suggested in the amendment, or in any other way that I should think of, would create further problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may not be such a grave disadvantage as there appears to be. One reason for adopting higher standards of regulation than were required by the designated agency would be to sell to the investing public the fact that they were being given additional safeguards, over and above those that they might obtain from members of other SROs. If that advantage is derived from an additional degree of protection, it is only right and follows as a corollary that investors should have the same rights in relation to rules that go above and beyond the requirements of the designated agency as they have to rules which meet only the standard of equivalence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am encouraged by the Minister's reply as he at least recognised the problem. He made a fair point about the possible difficulty if people contemplating action under either provision had to distinguish between one set of rules and another. I accept that problem, but I invite the Minister to take another look at the suggestion, although he has already spent some time on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister accepted in principle the possible deleterious long-term effects if the provision encouraged people to seek a less vigorous regime. That would be contrary to the general thrust and objective of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further problem, although I am not sure whether I can formulate it accurately. Surely the purpose of the Bill is not to give additional statutory remedies to the rules of voluntary bodies, which would be the effect of the clause. The fact that the stock exchange became an SRO under the proposed structure would mean that irrespective of whether all its rules were required by the Bill, the Secretary of State, SIB or a designated agency, they would all be actionable in principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is something slightly odd about that consequence, which is surely not the purpose of the Bill. The Bill's intention is to create a structure of rules and regulations to be defined by the principles of the Bill and by the conduct of business rules made under the Bill by SIB, which are required to have an equivalence in the rules of SROs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause would have an effect that went beyond that objective. I need not repeat myself because the Minister understands my argument. Here, the Bill seems not to be putting in place an agreed structure of rules backed by statute, but to be providing almost willy nill and at large further statutory remedies for provisions in a rule book with which the Bill has no concern. Is that not a difficulty and an anomaly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess that I am somewhat surprised at the line taken by the hon. Gentleman. One of the main purposes of the Bill is investor protection, which is provided by remedies for investors when rules are broken. In the manner with which we have all become familiar, the Bill sets out a minimum degree of investor protection, but we should like a higher degree of investor protection. If such protection can be provided by self-regulating organisations taking it upon themselves to draw up rules which go beyond those that would be necessary to establish equivalence with the rules of a designated agency, it is all to the good and should be encouraged. It is not something that the Bill should remedy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that does not create better investor protection unless the remedies apply in relation to those rules as well. We should like good regulation to drive out bad, as we wish to encourage the highest standards of investor protection. Amendments of the type proposed would detract from that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the Minister has thought the matter through—he is caught in a logical problem. He is right that there would be no point in the stock exchange having additional rules if there were no remedies available under the Bill. I am not sure that that is a good example, as the stock exchange has had those rules for some time and thought it worthwhile to have its rule book without the benefit of those provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Minister is mistaken if he thinks that the Bill will encourage other SROs to act in a similar fashion. A body such as the stock exchange which has rules that exceed the statutory requirements will ask why it should put its members at additional risk when other people can join ISRO, for example, with much less risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is mistaken. The provisions will not encourage better regulation. A long-term trend might develop of people deliberately seeking membership not of the stock exchange or bodies with similar rules, which exceed statutory requirement, but of bodies with a lesser degree of regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and I are not at cross-purposes in what we wish to achieve. He has followed a logical circle and stopped too soon. There are further complications yet to be unravelled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 90, in page 44, line 26, leave out sub-section (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to enable the intervention powers defined in chapter VI to be exercised by the Secretary of State or the designated agency in respect of members of self-regulating organisations and recognised professional bodies as well as in respect of those who are directly authorised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a familiar point; it concerns the relationship between the SIB and the SROs. I am encouraged to think that it would be sensible to accept the amendment when I look back to clause 54 which firmly prohibits disqualified individuals from carrying out investment business. However, in that clause the indviduals are described as employees or exempted representatives. There is no question of such people sheltering behind their employers or their firms. The Secretary of State or the designated agency says, quite rightly, "We must be able to get at the person who has carried out this deal or has given this investment advice."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the Secretary of State or the designated agency to be precluded by clause 59(4) from exercising that power in respect of individual members of self-regulating organisations is to get the balance between the SIB and the SROs just a little wrong. Taking the analogy of clause 54, the Secretary of State or the designated agency should be able to intervene in respect of a given person for the purposes set out in chapter VI.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This matter was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury (Mr. Whitfield) with the chairman of the Securities and Investments Board
	<span class='label label-info column'>490</span>
and he sent copies of the correspondence to me. My hon. Friend wanted a further strengthening of the board's powers and he wrote to Sir Kenneth Berrill asking whether he favoured such a proposal. In reply, Sir Kenneth said that if the board had the powers that the hon. Gentleman proposes in the amendment, it would have a corresponding responsibility. In practice, that would mean intervening against a firm that was regulated by an SRO or by a professional body and to do that the board would have to monitor continually SROs and professional bodies in their relationships with their individual member firms. I do not believe that the board could do that. Clearly, it must oversee SROs and professional bodies in a general way, but it cannot monitor in detail the day-to-day regulation of member firms. If it did, there would be tremendous duplication, because that is the principal task of the SRO or the professional body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it seems an attractive idea, in practice it is not, because practical difficulties would arise. Moreover, it would further undermine self-regulation for SROs and professional bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
