	<div class='title'>Draft Working Time Regulations 1999</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Competitiveness (Mr. Alan Johnson)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Working Time Regulations 1999.</p></blockquote>
A commitment to the creation of a flexible labour market, underpinned by decent minimum standards is central to the Government's approach to employment relations. We believe in fairness for all in the workplace. The working time regulations are an integral part of our employment legislative programme and contribute significantly to the Government's wider goal of promoting social justice and family-friendly employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since their introduction on 1 October last year, the working time regulations have provided protection to the most vulnerable workers, ensuring that they are able to enjoy the same conditions as the majority of workers in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe. Specifically, these rights are: no worker can be forced to work more than 48 hours a week on average; a right to paid annual leave—rising from three to four weeks later this month on 23 November; a right to rest breaks during the working day; a right to rest periods from work, including the right to a day off a week; special protection for night workers, including the right to health assessments; special protections for adolescent workers; and protection from unfair dismissal or detriment for asserting those rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the Government belive that those rights and entitlements are appropriate, and indeed long overdue, we also recognise that businesses have to operate them, and we are sensitive to any unnecessary problems that they may cause. Our approach to implementing the directive has, therefore, been to maximise flexibility wherever possible, as long as that does not diminish the protection provided by the directive. Consequently, the regulations allow for arrangements to be made, through agreement between employers and workers, that are appropriate to particular workplaces, suit the workers themselves and maximise efficiency for employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have been closely monitoring the effect of the regulations since they came into force. The feedback that we have received from workers has, not surprisingly, been positive, and in most respects the same has been true of feedback from employers. An Institute of Personnel and Development survey of employers found that an overwhelming majority of firms thought that the regulations were a good thing, did not feel that their business had been adversely affected and believed that the regulations would benefit their employees. However, recognising that this is new and complex legislation, we have kept an open mind as to how it can
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
most effectively be administered. In that respect, we believe that there is scope to help business without reducing the protections that are extended to workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 7 July my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced two proposed changes to the regulations, to cut the bureaucracy for employers and workers alike. The first amendment will dispense with the requirement to maintain detailed records for those who have voluntarily opted out of the working time limits. It will be replaced by a simple requirement to keep a list of those who have signed opt-out agreements. The Government consider that it is unreasonable to ask employers to maintain detailed records on members of staff who have decided entirely of their own volition to work longer hours. We do, of course, recognise that those who have opted out of the working time limit are still entitled to health and safety protection, but we do not believe that it is necessary to maintain records for such workers, unless the Health and Safety Executive considers them to be at risk. In that respect, the health and safety authorities will be able to obtain further information, including the keeping of records where appropriate, that is necessary to protect the health and safety of workers through the use of existing safety law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, workers receive protection from working excessive hours unless they choose otherwise. If their circumstances change after they opt out, or if they have a change of heart, they can choose to be covered by the working time limits again at any stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second amendment relates to the unmeasured working time derogation, which disapplies the working time limits for so-called autonomous workers, for whom the duration of working time is not measured or predetermined, or can be determined by the worker himself or herself. The intention is to allow the derogation to apply to workers who have an element of their working time predetermined, for example by contract but who choose to work longer of their own volition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would have the effect of disregarding some of a worker's time in respect of the working time limits. It does not exclude such workers from the entitlements to daily and weekly rest periods, rest breaks or paid annual leave. Those workers will also continue to be subject to the weekly working time limit in respect of time that they are required to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me be clear: having provided workers with safeguards from working long hours, we are not about to take those rights away from them. The amendments are there for those who put in more hours than their employer requires of them, because they want to, not because they are paid or required to. If the worker is required to work additional hours because of the demands of the job the amendment will not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If workers are unclear as to the application of the new measure, they will need to consider a test that the amendment sets, which is that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the specific characteristics of the job are such that, without being required to do so by their employer, the worker may also do work the duration of which is not measured or pre-determined or can be determined by the worker himself.</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0180">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Some or none of a worker's working time may meet the conditions of the test. Any working time that meets those conditions will not count towards the 48-hour weekly working time limit. Simply put, unless the worker has voluntarily decided to put in extra hours the amendment will not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the amendment will not apply to the teacher who must do marking after school, the cleaner who is required to work longer than usual after a function, the paramedic who is tending the injured after the end of a shift or the shop worker who is stocktaking after work. Prior to the Secretary of State laying the draft amendments before Parliament on 19 October, a brief period of consultation on the proposals was undertaken with major industry and enforcement bodies including the Trades Union Congress, the Confederation of British Industry and the Health and Safety Commission. Those bodies have also been actively involved in our deliberations on the amendments. We have listened to the opinions of both sides of industry. Indeed, it is as a result of our discussions that we have decided to issue guidance on the amendments. That will provide clarity in a form that should leave no doubt as to their application and no room for ambiguity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Rosie Winterton
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Doncaster, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much welcome the partnership approach that my hon. Friend the Minister has outlined. Real partnership needs to be inclusive of all sides of industry, as he said. He talked about the consultation that has taken place so far; can he reassure the Committee that there will continue to be consultation between the House, the CBI and the TUC about the implementation of the regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can give my hon. Friend the assurance that she seeks. Until we actually get the regulations on the statute book we cannot produce the guidance. When we produce the guidance we shall have consultations over the following four weeks with the Health and Safety Commission, the TUC, the CBI and the other bodies that were consulted when the regulations were first laid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the amendments come into force we will re-publish guidance on the regulations, which will draw on the experiences and matters raised since they came into force. It will be in a user-friendly format providing clarity for both workers and employers. Again, that shows that the Government will provide as much help as possible to ensure that both sides of industry can operate the regulations effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is crucial to emphasise that the amendments affect only those workers who are voluntarily working long hours. Nobody can be forced into working long hours or signing away their working time protections. Even if they decide to sign the opt-out, they can choose to opt back in again at any time, without fear of recrimination from the employer. The amendments are designed to make an already effective piece of legislation operate more effectively. They cut red tape, but they do not cut the important protection that the Government have established for people at work. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.40 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Gibb 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister to the Front Bench. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
regulations are the first that he has presented to a Committee, and as he is a member of the current Government, they will be the first of many. His Department has already issued 280 items of delegated legislation since the Government were elected, and no doubt many more will follow. I also welcome my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) to his first delegated legislation Committee following his tremendous by-election victory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to reiterate the Opposition's concern about the lack of Parliamentary debate and scrutiny of the original working time regulations, which were sneaked out by the Government on the day before the House rose for the summer recess last year. They came into force on 1 October, while the House was in recess, and, because of moves made by the Opposition, were debated retrospectively in a one-and-a-half-hour debate held when the House resumed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are not insignificant. They add £1.9 billion of costs to business in a year. Next year, they will add about £2.3 billion. They received minimal Parliamentary scrutiny and are rushed-through legislation. They also far exceed the regulations required by the original directive. Indeed, they are another example of the Government gold-plating European directives. The Minister is now seeking to tone down the regulations to a small degree, but they add hugely to the burdens faced by business. The unanimous complaint of businesses, large and small, is that they are drowning under an avalanche of burdensome regulations. The working time directive is commonly cited as the latest and most burdensome of all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, the Institute of Directors has said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Working Time regulations represent yet more costs and burdens on business. They restrict labour flexibility and impose costly new obligations on companies".</p></blockquote>
In contrast to the Minister's remarks, about half the respondents to a questionnaire distributed by the Institute of Directors in a survey of its businesses said that their overall business would be damaged by the imposition of the working time directive. A mere 3 per cent. said that their businesses would be helped. The businesses are right, which is why the Government's own regulatory impact assessment showed that the cost of implementing the regulations would be about £2 billion a year. The regulations will remove a mere £13 million a year—£13 million out of the £2 billion is barely significant, even with the rounding of the original estimate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the original regulations had had more Parliamentary scrutiny, and if the Secretary of State had listened to the Opposition and to my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), the Minister might not have had to return to the House just 12 months after their introduction to seek to amend badly drafted and burdensome regulations. In the one-and-a-half-hour Commons debate to which I have referred, my right hon. Friend said that we wanted the Minister to
	<br><blockquote><p>"consider whether more exemptions would be sensible, and to come up with less onerous record keeping. Much of the cost will be in record keeping, not improving people's jobs but creating a lot of bureaucracy."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 27 October 1999; Vol. 336, c. 220.]</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0181">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
If the Government had listened then, hon. Members would not have to be here today. More importantly, businesses would not have had to struggle during the past year with what the Government now accept are unnecessarily burdensome—or, as the Minister put it, "unreasonable"—record-keeping requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the Government have begun to realise their mistake and that they are beginning to take on board the Opposition's exhortations and the concerns of business on the record-keeping element of the working time regulations. It was clearly absurd that when an employee agreed with his or her employer to opt out of the 48-hour limit on the working week, the employer had to keep detailed records of the hours that the employee worked. It is a welcome relief that the regulations remove that requirement. To the extent that the regulations attempt—in however small a way—to mitigate the burdens of the original regulations, the Opposition will not oppose them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The record-keeping obligations have been the main source of concern for businesses. For example, the CBI said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The lack of clarity in many of the Regulations … is posing problems for companies trying to implement them.</p></blockquote>
It went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Areas of confusion include the definition of 'unmeasured working time'"</p></blockquote>
and "the record-keeping requirement."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding who shall fall within the exemption for unmeasured time, the guide—a publication intended to clarify matters—says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is not possible to specify a complete list of cases which would fall into the relevant category. The Regulations cite as examples 'managing executives or other persons with autonomous decision-taking powers, family workers or workers officiating at religious ceremonies in churches and religious communities'. However, it is important to note that these are for illustration only. It is the characteristics of a worker's activity that will determine whether they may be excluded."</p></blockquote>
That is of no help at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State acknowledged concerns about the matter in June when he said in a speech to the British Chambers of Commerce:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have been listening carefully to what business has to say about the complexities of the new working time regulations. We will be publishing revised and improved guidance on the regulations in the next few weeks."</p></blockquote>
I have sympathy for the Secretary of State—he inherited from his two Labour predecessors what a key Government supporter has called a dog's breakfast of a set of regulations. The confusion is added to, not reduced, by the guide issued by the Department of Trade and Industry, which he also inherited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On page 25, the guide says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The employer would need to ensure that their means of monitoring workers' working time would be adequate to highlight instances of workers working in excess of the standard working hours. The employer may need to monitor the hours worked by such workers more closely".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
That phrase seems to contradict completely what the Secretary of State said in his June speech, namely that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the vast majority of individuals do not need to keep a specific record of the hours they work."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister confirm that those misleading words will be removed from the revised guide? Will he tell the Committee whether the revised guide will be a completely reprinted version of the existing guide? If so, how much will reprinting and redistribution cost?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In June, the Secretary of State said that the revised guide would be issued in a few weeks. It is now November, and there is no new guide. Presumably, that is because the original draft regulations, published in July, have had to be withdrawn and replaced, in October, with the draft that we are debating. Will the Minister say whether the revised guide was reprinted before the latest draft regulations were placed before the House and before the original draft was withdrawn?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations appear to have been withdrawn because of pressure from the Trades Union Congress and to help the Secretary of State to have a less rough ride at the TUC conference. The only difference between the previous draft regulations and this draft comes with regulation 5. That regulation states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"35A.—(1) The Secretary of State shall, after consulting persons appearing to him to represent the two sides of industry, arrange for the publication, in such form and manner as he considers appropriate, of information and advice concerning the operation of these Regulations."</p></blockquote>
That situation is extraordinary, and can mean only one thing: that the interpretation of words and phrases in the amending regulations, which are still far from clear, will be determined by the Government—following the Committee's deliberations—in consultation with the Confederation of British Industry and the TUC. The regulations will then be published in the form of a revised DTI guide. That guide will take on the form of legislation, although it will not have been considered by the House. It is outrageous that the Minister should come before the Committee with regulations, the correct and definitive meaning of which he does not know because the regulations as drafted say that he cannot know their definitive meaning because he has yet to consult and publish a revised guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have all been issued with guidance that the Minister says in his letter to members of the Committee is still in draft form because the Secretary of State can discharge his statutory responsibilities to consult the two sides of industry only after Parliament has approved the regulations. That is a Catch-22: he cannot give a definitive definition of the provisions because he has a statutory duty to consult the two sides of industry on how the words will be implemented in practice, and he cannot hold that consultation until the Committee has passed the regulations. I find that extraordinary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's letter goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The draft has been developed in the light of informal discussion with interested parties",</p></blockquote>
a point that he reiterated in his opening remarks. What a complete shambles. Even with my short time in the House, I know that that is not the way in which to handle
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0182">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
legislation. Will the Minister confirm that he cannot give the Committee a firm interpretation of the wording of the regulations because regulation 5 prevents him from so doing? If he cannot give that confirmation now, can he tell us why he is consulting only the CBI, the TUC and the Health and Safety Commission? What about the Federation of Small Businesses, the Institute of Directors or the British Chambers of Commerce? Why will he not officially consult those bodies, which also represent a side of industry, in the next four weeks?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the interpretation that the Minister gives the Committee today be subject to change as a result of the consultation required by regulation 5? The Secretary of State's letter of 7 July regarding consultation, to which the Minister referred, said that the new derogation will apply to paid overtime because
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is measured and the duration is determined by the employer."</p></blockquote>
Will any paid overtime be included in the calculation of working time as set out in example A of the draft guidance? Will that be the case even if the overtime duration is determined by employees themselves? When I was a trainee chartered accountant, paid overtime was available but, as trainee professionals, we could decide how and when or whether we would work that overtime. Does the current guidance mean that those hours, even if they are voluntarily worked, would be regarded as part of the 48-hour working week just because they were paid?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Example E in the draft guidance deals with the employee who is keen to be promoted and says that "if it is established" that working additional time is a precondition for promotion, that time should be included in calculating the working time. My understanding of life in the real world is that if one wants to be promoted, one must work extra hours. Will the Minister confirm that that provision will apply in all cases where people who are keen to be promoted are working long hours? Will he explain what he means by the phrase "if it is established"? Will mere rumour be sufficient? What evidence will employers be required to maintain showing that such a requirement for long hours is not a precondition for promotion?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Example G involves an employee with a managerial role who decides how and when he works. Will the Minister elaborate on what the Government intend by that? What kind of managerial role do they have in mind and how is it distinguishable from
	<br><blockquote><p>"managing executives or persons with autonomous decision-making powers",</p></blockquote>
as set out in what will now be regulation 20(1) of the original working time regulations? The distinction between those two different managerial roles matters because some elements of paid rest and holiday time are exempt from one and not from the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, how is an employer to interpret example C, concerning the employee whose volume of work necessitates longer hours than those contracted for? Will it simply be a matter of whether employees themselves complain that they have too great a volume of work and cannot cope? What happens if another employee with a similar volume of work can manage to complete it within the specified time? Will the Minister confirm that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Health and Safety Executive may continue to require detailed hourly records to be kept for categories of employees who voluntarily opt out of the 48-hour week but who are considered to be at risk? Where in the regulations is the exemption from the exemption?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amending regulations and examples in the draft guidance contain huge ambiguities, many of which will have to await tribunal cases before they are clarified, so placing a huge burden on business. It will help employers and business immensely if the Minister clarifies those ambiguities, but he may not be allowed to do so. In the Secretary of State's June speech to the British Chambers of Commerce, he said that the new guidance will give
	<br><blockquote><p>"additional guidance on who is covered by the Regulations and what is meant by working time".</p></blockquote>
That is useful to know. We should be told what the new guidance will say because it has a direct bearing on our deliberations today. What is covered by the regulations and what is meant by working time?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the Government's policy on individual opt-out? Do they intend to remove it from the regulations, as required by the directive, in 2003? The original regulatory impact assessment forecast that the working time regulations would increase the work load of the industrial tribunal by an additional 3,000 to 6,000 cases a year. Has that transpired in the first year of the operation of the regulations? How many cases have there been? Finally, when will the long-awaited new Department of Trade and Industry guide be published?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Working time regulations are a complete shambles, and a phenomenally expensive shambles at that, adding £2 billion a year to business costs. Although the amending regulations attempt to scrape off a tiny sliver of confusion, uncertainty and burden, they merely add to the confusion. It is time for the Government genuinely to listen to the cries of business about over-regulation instead of just mouthing the words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Weston-super-Mare)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister to the Front Bench where he is having a baptism of fire with the many questions that are being asked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also welcome the working time directive. It is important that the measures are introduced because we should be concerned about the impact of the workplace on family life and the general well-being of the family. Many people have expressed concern about the stress that business puts on individuals. However, I also support what the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) said about the rushed way in which the directive was brought into operation almost immediately after last year's recess and the lack of consultation. It is reassuring that the Minister is talking about future consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am encouraged to hear the Minister say that many businesses do not believe that they have been affected too badly by the regulations, which we support, but I hope that that does not imply a complacency on the part of the Minister and his Department and that they will not continue to monitor the effects of these and any future regulations. Perhaps there are other ways of alleviating the burden imposed by the directive.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0183">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
The Minister may know that I run a small business. I received a communication from an organisation that seemed to set itself up as semi-official, about what I should be doing about the new working time regulations. The letter was framed in such a way as to spread alarm among employers by listing the various obligations that they must meet—I shall happily send it to the Minister so that he may see for himself. It somewhat militates against the light touch to which he referred if organisations send communications to employers implying that the regulations impose a massive burden and saying that if they do not do something they will be in trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are basically three regulations before us. I was gratified to learn that regulation 3 will loosen the requirements—which seem to be unnecessary in the first place—for businesses that opt out to keep a lot of false records. That is to be welcomed. Peripherally, there is always some concern—I hope that the Minister's Department will keep an eye on this aspect of the regulations—that there should be no undue intimidation of or pressure on employees to encourage them to opt out when they do not want to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 4 on unmeasured time is complicated, and I am sure that we should all welcome an expanded explanation and examples of exactly who is covered and how the regulation will be implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to regulation 5, as I have already said, I have an interest in small businesses because I run one myself and I am my party's spokesman on small businesses. I must emphasise to the Minister that, in addition to consulting the bodies mentioned in the covering letter that I received—which said that consultation will take place with the health and safety authorities, the Confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress—it is vital that the Federation of Small Businesses, the Forum of Private Business, the Small Business Bureau, as well as many other small business organisations and individual businesses are properly consulted to assess the impact on businesses of the working time regulations and other regulations. I should have liked to see it in print that small business organisations will be consulted because any regulation has a far greater impact on small businesses, which have fewer resources. However, I conclude by welcoming the Minister's initiatives, in so far as they reduce the burden of regulation, and hope that this will be a continuing process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I add my welcome to the Minister in his new post. We are both here for the first time, although in markedly different roles. I endorse the opening remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. I am also grateful to the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter) for endorsing so many of my hon. Friend's remarks, especially about the due process for implementing a directive—it was before my time in the House—that has created so much concern and caused so many questions to be asked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
It may become apparent as I make my points that I was not present during the previous rounds on the matter but I was disturbed and disappointed to find that the explanatory note attached to the draft regulations—I assume that it is published by the Department of Trade and Industry—refers to the "two sides of industry", which is something of an anachronism. The phrase was repeated by the Minister when he said that both sides of industry were to be consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not square well with the tone and, indeed, the actual words of the Prime Minister to the CBI conference where he tried to impress on all who cared to listen that there are no longer two sides of industry. On that point alone I find myself agreeing more with the Prime Minister than with the Minister, because I have 10 years' experience in a large industry, in a company that was in the FTSE 100 until it was taken over by a French multinational. It is clear to me that over the past decade the concept of the two sides of industry has largely broken down. It causes me some misgivings; when I look back at the time when I was at the lower end of things, both as a painter-decorator and then as a solicitor's clerk, I did not ask for pay for longer hours; I was trying to get on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I moved up through the lower ranks and eventually reached the higher ranks, both in the legal profession and in industry, there was no crying out for those protections from anyone with whom I worked or for whom I had responsibility. Any anxiety appears to have been caused by implementing the directive, because there is a concern that our costs might be more competitive than our European competitors'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious that management and those who are called workers—I would apply the word to all who work within an enterprise—are to some degree being patronised by the proposal. It would have been better to discover whether there was a wish to implement the proposal and, as a mark of good management and good business, to enable a company to opt in rather than having to seek a derogation out of the regulations. That would have been a better, more consistent and more principled approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I visited a furniture manufacturer in my constituency during the by-election campaign, who explained to me that not only does he have to cope with difficult bureaucracy and red tape in order to monitor the minimum wage regulations, but he will have the worry of implementing the working time directive. He employs a large number of low-skilled but very dedicated and committed people. The most admirable thing about the company is that 85 per cent. of his work force are registered disabled. Because the business is making furniture, a lot of his employees can be seated while at work and many of them are thus capable of earning a living, which they would not otherwise be able to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The employer said that although the regulations would not change employees' working patterns, he would have to take on an additional person in the personnel department—much more highly paid than those on the manufacturing floor of his enterprise—just to look after the minimum wage regulations and the anticipated working time regulations. That has added to his costs; it is part of the £1.9 billion to which my hon. Friend the

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Scarborough and Whitby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman visited that company in his constituency, what was the response from the work force regarding the new legislation? If he extols the virtues of partnership in industry—as I do—will he say whether his constituents have benefited directly and what their feedback to him was?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I extol the virtues of a partnership in enterprise: all people, whatever their level or role in an enterprise have equal value. An enterprise can be competitive and relevant in a marketplace only if they are all able to play their part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The conversation on that visit during the by-election campaign was with both management—hence my point about the additional person in the personnel department—and people on the shop floor. The visit was long enough for me to see for myself that 85 per cent. of the work force were disabled. They said that they were all paid above the minimum wage, even if not much above, so new regulation would not make any difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding their working times, they gave the example of a big order. If an hotel was being built and it needed to be kitted out "just in time", that approach being the way forward for business competitiveness, they would want to work all the hours given. There would be no question of their being paid for those extra hours. There was no issue of their needing protection because they already felt that they were being properly rewarded. That was the response that I received. From my experience, I believe that the regulation will add to the costs of a business with which I am familiar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further question—the Minister may be able to answer it quickly, demonstrating that I have not long been a Member of the House—concerns those forced to work more than the average of 48 hours a week. Over what period is that average calculated? The biggest worry that I bring from my constituency concerns the many people who work in the horticultural business. They are being slammed by the threat of the climate change levy—the energy tax. Further, they work in a seasonal business. They cannot—surprise, surprise—control the weather. In a good year, especially for the approximately six months of spring and summer, they work flat out, but they have little to do during the winter months. During the year, they would hope to earn a reasonable living. Over what period the average was calculated would make a huge difference to them—it would be of grave concern to them if it were taken over a week, a month or even three months. If it were taken over six months, it might not be such a cause for concern, but during a bad year, 18 months might not be long enough; the average should perhaps be taken over 24 months. We should perhaps reflect on that issue, and I look forward to a response from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot gainsay the fact that the regulations are being introduced to implement the European Union directive. They are not a part of the EU's social chapter policy with which I am in any sympathy; most responsible
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
businesses would take the action required by themselves. The regulations represent an attempt to level up British costs to meet those of our worst European competitors, and to level down the competitiveness of British industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said that we sneaked out the proposals which he described as a complete shambles and a dog's breakfast. He referred to events of last year, but we should go back one stage further. We inherited not just a complete shambles but a dog's breakfast with a double helping of mishmash because the previous Government, having taken their case to the European Court of Justice, were comprehensively defeated on the basis of agreements with which they had complied in the early 1990s. As a result of their incompetence, we could have been taken to court under Francovitch proceedings. The refusal to apply the regulations from their due date of 23 November 1996 could have cost the British taxpayer a lot of money, which gave the incoming Government the problem of how long they could consult. However, there is nothing wrong with the Government listening to the concerns of business, including its concerns about the regulations that have been in force for a year, and today's regulations show that that is what we are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the effect on business, the Institute of Personnel and Development, which represents 55 per cent. of companies with 50 or more employees, showed in its
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0185">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
survey that the regulations were, in general, accepted, with 78 per cent. of companies saying that the working time directive was a good thing. This weekend, that tribune of the people, the 
	<i>Hull Daily Mail,</i> quoted the manager of a cleaning company—the type of business that was thought to be at most risk from the regulations—as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Thanks to this"—</p></blockquote>
the working time regulations and other employment laws introduced by the Government—
	<br><blockquote><p>"price bands have been narrowed between competitors as labour costs, which were anything up to 80 per cent. of the price of a service, are now no longer a variable. As a result, undercutting prices and reducing costs at the expense of staff employed, hours worked and pay rates, is now, thankfully largely a thing of the past."</p></blockquote>
I believe that that is the view of most companies that were extremely worried about being undercut by exploitative employers. The regulations have been widely welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, I must address the confusion that surrounds existing regulations. A regulation was included in last year's draft to cover workers who are entirely unmeasured and autonomous, to whom the hon. Gentleman referred. Those workers are disregarded for all forms of protection apart from annual leave, which applies to everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the first year of operation of the legislation, we found that there are groups of workers whose work is divided between time that is unmeasured and autonomous, and predetermined hours. We are trying to cater for that group. By virtue of the fact that some of their hours are predetermined, they are entitled to rest breaks and all the other protections in the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Long and various questions were asked, including whether there was a definitive view on the meaning of the regulations. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton misunderstands the nature of guidance: it will not change the regulations. There is a series of precedents for what we are doing, as the hon. Gentleman well knows—I know from when we served in various deliriously happy Finance Bill Committees that he does his homework. We are saying that if the regulations are adopted today, they will not change. Their acceptance will allow us to consult on statutory guidance, which is what we plan to do, but those guidelines will not affect the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not it a fiction by which we all abide in this place that when a Minister introduces regulations, he has a view as to their interpretation, and that all the issues about what they mean have been dealt with and resolved before the Committee meets? That means that the purpose of the Committee is to quiz the Minister and obtain the precise meaning of the regulations so that we as Members of Parliament can decide whether to support them. Ministers do not decide on their interpretation after the Committee has met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a new precedent which makes our deliberations almost impossible. The Committee is meeting to debate the regulations, yet there is no certainty as to their interpretation and meaning. In the case of other
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
legislation for which guidance is produced, that guidance is almost ready to go to the printers when the Committee meets, which is as it should be. Consultation on the meaning of the regulations does not take place after they have been passed. That is what I find so confusing, and I think people outside the House will find it confusing, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that. This is a complex issue, and we are talking about people in multifarious jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are making two changes, one of which is straightforward—it is no longer necessary to keep records of the hours worked by people who opt out of the working time directive's 48-hour limit. I have tried to explain the other change. There is already provision for unmeasured time—indeed, when the regulations were adopted last year, it was understood that we could not cater for every eventuality and list all the options. Now we are catering for a hybrid situation—people whose hours of work are partly predetermined and partly autonomous. The Health and Safety Executive itself suggested that we should give some examples but also that we should make it absolutely clear that they are not prescriptive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we are doing this in exactly the right way. The only difference between us is that Conservative Members did not want any regulations in the first place. When they were forced into accepting them, their version of consultation before the general election was the recommendation that rest breaks should be five minutes rather than 20 minutes and that paid annual leave should be a requirement only after an employee has been with the company a year. There were various other horrendous and appalling suggestions, which would have caused British workers to continue to be as exploitable as any other group of workers in the world, or even more so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton also asked whether revised guidance had been put on hold. He was trying to make the point that we might have had to ditch a complete run of this guidance and print another lot. That is not so. The new guidance has not been printed yet. I was asked when I expected it to be ready. The full guidance will be reissued in due course before the end of the year—subject, of course, to the Committee's decision today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also asked whether we would consult. As I said, we shall consult the CBI, the TUC and others. Apart from the Secretary of State's formal consultation, there is now a four-week period during which any group can express its views. Indeed, the organisation mentioned by the hon. Member for Eddisbury was consulted first time around and was appreciative of the changes considered today. That answers the question about consulting other bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The comments made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton about promotion suggested that things have changed in the outside world since he was a chartered accountant. They have certainly changed since my days as a postman, which is the only profession to which I can lay claim. His comments on promotion were remarkable. Many companies and parts of the civil service now make it clear to the work force that they do not expect them to work horrendously long hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0186">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
Surprising though it may seem to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, people who want a decent and meaningful job also want a fulfilled life outside the workplace. Most employers are finding that that is an important part of working life, and are going out of their way to remind people periodically that promotion will not be gained by staying at work until the early hours in an attempt to suggest that their lives revolve around the workplace. I have news for the Opposition: these days, promotion is usually based on merit and not on time serving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to get rid of that long-hours culture. The hon. Member for Eddisbury, who made other points with which I shall deal in due course, asked why the Government had adopted this approach and said that most people in the company that he visited did not see a need for it. One reason for our approach is the clear evidence showing that cardiovascular problems, in particular, are caused by long hours. It is not just that we in Britain work longer hours than anybody else in the European Union; we work horrendously longer hours. I remind the Committee that in Austria, 3.6 per cent. of the working population work 48 hours plus per week. In Finland, the figure is 2.9 per cent., and in the Netherlands, which has a good economic record, 1.5 per cent. In the United Kingdom, however, 26.2 per cent. of the working population work more than 48 hours a week. Politicians must tackle that problem. Ignoring it and hoping that it would go away was a mistake that led to the current horrendous situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ben Bradshaw 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Exeter)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: While my hon. Friend the Minister is speaking about long hours and competitiveness, will he disabuse the hon. Member for Eddisbury in respect of his notion that the regulations are some sort of plot from Europe to rob Britain of its competitiveness? As my hon. Friend has just said, competitiveness and hours worked have no relationship whatever. Britain is still in the bottom half of the competitiveness league in Europe, while its workers work longer hours. If France was so uncompetitive, a French company might not have taken over the company for which the hon. Member for Eddisbury used to work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes his point eloquently. There are apparently plots in Millbank affecting Bognor Regis, and now plots in Europe are affecting the working time directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton also asked about overtime, and spoke of his time as a chartered accountant. If overtime is being paid, it will apply to measured hours that do not come under the terms of the regulations, whether in chartered accountancy or in any other profession. He asked about the individual opt-out. Britain is the only country in Europe with the opt-out, apart from the Republic of Ireland, which is gradually reducing its working hours down to 48 a week by 2000. The opt-out will not go in 2003, but is due to be reviewed at that time. We will obviously want to see the result of the Commission's review then, but we believe that workers should have a choice on the hours that they work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I very much appreciated the comments of the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare. There is no complacency in the Government. We are moving into a
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
brave new world. This country has never had basic, civilised, minimum decent standards for people at work. The previous Government took us backwards during the 18 years that they were in power; we used to have Shops and Factories Acts, as well as wages councils, but the previous Government removed them all. If we go back beyond that, even the trade union movement in this country was iffy about introducing basic minimum standards. This is the first time that such standards have been introduced, and we are convinced that, if they are to continue, they must have the support of people on both sides of business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is still early days, but we are finding out that businesses appreciate the regulations. The time will come when the Conservative party will stop being the only decent—I say decent, and I mean that—mainstream right-of-centre political party in Europe that is opposed to minimum standards. No other Conservative party in Europe would even suggest that such protections should be removed from vulnerable workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have tackled most of the points raised by the hon. Member for Eddisbury. He asked a question about average hours. The hours are averaged over 17 weeks. They can be averaged over a longer period—26 weeks, if there is a seasonal problem in the company, or as much as a year, if the company reaches either a work force agreement, if there is no trade union, or a collective agreement, if there is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the other point raised by the hon. Member for Eddisbury about my reference to "both sides of industry". I used that term because it is used in the directive. I would much rather reach an agreement with Her Majesty's loyal Opposition that we both refer to them as the "social partners"—that is my favoured term—but we need to repeat the words that are in the directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: As calling me his hon. Friend stretches the point—

The regulations have been in force for 12 months, and the Conservative party should recognise that, in those 12 months, the earth has not stopped turning and civilisation as we know it has not disintegrated. In fact, I believe that we have made a small contribution to civilisation by introducing modest minimum standards for employees. Her Majesty's loyal Opposition must come to terms with the change that is taking place. The working time directive is proving to be a success. These changes try to make it better, and I believe that there will come a day when no political party in this country dare to criticise these basic minimum standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what the Minister meant by his last remark, but it resonates with his leader's speech at the Labour party conference, which I found quite frightening. I shall dare to criticise the regulations, regardless of the terrible consequences that might befall me, because they are hugely concerning to business,

which has to implement the measures. If the Minister looks beyond personnel departments to real business and to people in Britain, he will see their concern about the burden of regulation being imposed on British business. It is the one key issue that all businesses and business organisations raise when I visit or consult them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Minister made a brave attempt to answer some of the questions asked by Opposition Members, but I am afraid that he passed on five. I suspect that he passed on questions to which he felt unable to respond because he has not yet formally consulted the organisations that the regulations require him to consult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I asked him to define the evidence that an employer will be required to maintain to show that he does not have a policy of requiring employees to work longer hours for promotion. That is not an academic point; it concerns the realities faced by businesses in dealing with the regulations. They are concerned about whether they have a long-hours culture that requires people to work long hours for promotion. How should they determine whether they have such a culture? How should they prove to the Health and Safety Commission or to any other inspectors that they do not have such a requirement and that they can therefore rest easy that diligent and keen employees who wish to be promoted and who work long hours are doing so voluntarily and not because of a perceived need to work such hours to obtain promotion? How do employers prove to officials that they will not fall into that trap?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I asked the Minister about example C in his draft guidance, which concerns employees whose volume of work necessitates longer hours. How should employers interpret that example? Should the nature of the employment be decided on the employee's claims? Will the Minister give some guidance now, and not later, on how employers should interpret that aspect of the draft guidance?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, will the Minister also confirm his opening remarks? I am not sure whether I heard them correctly, so it would be helpful if he would repeat and clarify them. Will there be a category of employee who, despite having reached an agreement with an employer to opt out of the 48-hour working week, will nevertheless be required to keep details of hours worked because he or she is in an industry that the Health and Safety Commission regards as at risk?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, will the Minister confirm whether the industrial tribunal case load has increased in the past year because of the regulations? Fifthly, I must remind the Minister that I asked for a definition of the term "managerial role". I did not do so because I sought to go
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
back to the original regulations, which set out the role of somebody who can determine his or her hours. I understand the difference in the amending regulations before us. However, example G of the draft guidance deals with a worker who has a managerial role, who decides how and when he works, who chooses what is and is not done and who determines the time and effort devoted to tasks. Will the Minister define, as I have already asked him to, what that managerial role is? Will he also explain how it is different from the managerial role referred to in regulation 20(1) of the regulations as amended? The issue matters; some exemptions apply to paragraph 21 but do not apply to regulation 20(2).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rather unusually, I shall now call the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare, to give the Minister a chance to reply to the questions of both Opposition Members who have spoken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.38 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cotter</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for explaining the issue of consultation. I reiterate that the small business aspect is very important. I hope that red tape and bureaucracy will continue to be monitored in respect of these and other regulations. I should also reiterate my concern about the communication that I received in my company, which seemed to scaremonger about the regulations, and which will perhaps make firms feel that they have to do rather more than they need to do. The Minister may want to consider whether the Small Business Service, which will be established in the next few months, should take on board such concerns and advise small firms about regulation and keeping it to the minimum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I welcome the hon. Member for Eddisbury, who presumably we should describe as "new Tory". Like some of my hon. Friends, I was rather concerned about the concept he outlined, that we are being dragged along by Europe to offer reasonable conditions in this country. Any reasonable employer knows the sort of conditions we are talking about. Many people on the Conservative Benches said that the minimum wage would cause enormous problems, but it has not done so. If the Government ensure that the measure is properly implemented, it will be all to the good for employers as well as for employees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I responded to a couple of points to which the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton says that I did not reply. Let me therefore try again. There was one question to which I did not respond because I did not hear it; I was probably concentrating on something else. There have been about 3,000 new employment tribunal cases to date, as predicted with new legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned people who sign an opt-out to work more than 48 hours a week but who may still have to produce records. That is absolutely in line with the directive. Article 18(b)(i) states that workers can opt out provided that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the records are placed at the disposal of the competent authority"—</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0188">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
the Health and Safety Executive—
	<br><blockquote><p>"which may for reasons connected with the safety and/or health of workers prohibit or restrict the possibility of exceeding the aximum weekly working hours."</p></blockquote>
The point was made by the Health and Safety Executive. If we make this change, which we think is sensible and will reduce bureaucracy, employers will not have to track every hour worked by people who have opted out of the 48-hour week. In accordance with the directive, where the HSE thinks that there is an abuse at any company, it must still have the ability to ask for records to be kept for the purpose once it is alerted to a possible problem. The Health and Safety Executive would respond to a concern and then ask the company to keep records to see whether there was a problem. That is in accordance with the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare made a point about small businesses. The Small Business Service will play a role in policy to ensure that the regulations take account of small and medium enterprises. The guidance will be targeted on SMEs because we recognise that, as the hon. member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said, there is a problem with small companies that do not have personnel units but need clear and precise guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton also asked about promotion, one aspect of which I dealt with. He asked how we could tell if a company was insisting that people had to work long hours in order to gain promotion. In the absence of evidence of a long-hours culture, it is unlikely to be a problem with the HSE. If a worker is unhappy about not being promoted, he or she will be able to adduce evidence as to what was said by the employer. For example, an employee may he able to adduce, perhaps from some of the literature to which the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton referred, that there are letters floating around the company saying, "If you don't work until half-past one in the morning you are not likely to get very far in this company." That would be a specific piece of evidence to back up an employment tribunal case or a reference to the Health and Safety Executive.

I have tried to answer all the questions on a very complex matter. I hope that with those assurances and explanations the Committee will vote in favour of the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
